text          |        The critical operation needed to achieve 3-dimensional integrated circuits
              | (3DICs) is obtaining single-crystal, device-quality semiconductor material on upper
              | circuit layers without damaging circuits below (400°C temperature limit). Simulation
              | shows that microsecond pulse 532 nm Nd:YAG laser can melt and crystallize
              | amorphous Si or Ge layers without excessively heating the circuit layers underneath.
              | However, experimental results of unseeded (graphoepitaxy) and seeded (RMG)
              | crystallization of Si and Ge indicate that much longer pulse lengths are required for
              | high-quality single-crystal formation, rendering the approach not 3DIC compatible.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        A more straightforward approach is to directly attach high-quality crystal islands
              | for upper-layer device fabrication. A variety of viable low-temperature (≤400°C)
              | bonding methods have been investigated: fusion bonding (SiO2-SiO2, Si-SiO2, Ge-
              | SiO2), thermo-compressive bonding (Cu-Cu, Ti-Ti), as well as AlGe eutectic bonding.
              | The unique advantages of AlGe technique for 3DICs are reported for the first time.
              | They include superior bond strength, low void density, non-stringent roughness
              | requirement, use of thin films and CMOS friendly materials. Finally, we present a
              | completed 3DIC compatible process of obtaining single crystal Si or Ge islands for
              | upper layer device fabrication via SmartCut® and CMP finish.

title         | 1.1 Motivation

text          |        As the features of a MOSFET continue with their relentless descent deep into
              | sub-100 nm dimensions, device performance improves with decreasing intrinsic
              | transistor delay [1]. However, simultaneous miniaturization of interconnects does not
              | enhance circuit performance, setting a limitation that potentially threatens to decelerate
              | or halt the historical progression of the conventional (2D) semiconductor circuits
              | (Figure 1.1) [2]. In particular, as the cross-sectional area of metal wires shrinks, the
              | effective resistance increases while their coupling capacitance also grows as they are
              | placed ever closer together. At the same time, growing complexity and circuit area
              | required by new functionalities radically augment both the total number of
              | interconnects and their length. Combined, these factors set scaling limitations such as
              | increased RC delay and power consumption of interconnects (Fig. 1.1) [3].

              | architectures. Interconnect delay limits the 2D IC performance, but promises significant
              |   reduction with 3D integration [2]; b) Power consumption by the MPU interconnects
              |   grows with successive generations [1]. The data is normalized to a constant VDD to
              |                        reflect the effects of interconnect scaling.

text          |        Three dimensional integrated circuits (3DICs), where multiple layers of active
              | devices are stacked directly on top of each other, offer an attractive architectural
              | solution to the 2D scaling limitations by offering better packing density, increased
              | performance, and greater functionality (Fig. 1.2) [4-7]. To begin, adding a third
              | dimension to 2D circuits increases density and reduces chip footprint. This is
              | particularly appealing for wireless or portable electronics where silicon real estate is at
              | premium. 3DICs also promise reduced average interconnect length, yielding less RC
              | delay, less power consumption, less noise coupling and enhanced accessible die area [8-
              | 10]. Finally, vertical integration of heterogeneous materials and devices could open the
              | door for hybrid photonic/electronic circuits, combined digital/analog/RF circuits,
              | stacked memory on logic circuits, and other novel system designs [3].

text          |        Together with these compelling benefits come certain challenges that need to be
              | addressed before 3D integration becomes accepted as a mainstream technology. Firstly,
              | maintaining device integrity on lower layers during 3DIC fabrication is of crucial
              | importance, where excessive thermal cycling could degrade the electrical integrity of
              | the underlying devices. Secondly, managing increased power densities in tightly packed
              | 3D circuits require new schemes to dissipate power efficiently and minimize thermal
              | stresses [11-13]. Thirdly, new processes need to be developed to precisely align and
              | interconnect multiple layers in order to fully harness 3DIC benefits. If the alignment
              | accuracy is poorer than the critical feature size, limited vertical via density could
              | ultimately diminish the very advantage of going 3D [14]. Finally, due to inherent

title         | 1.2 Construction methods for 3-D ICs
blank         | 
text          |        There are numerous technologies developed to achieve 3D integration. The
              | packaging community has pursued the simplest solution where bare dies are stacked
              | vertically, secured by epoxy or other types of ‘glue’. Companies such as STAT
              | ChipPAC [17] and Irvine Sensors [18] implement wiring between layers as peripheral
              | interconnections, as exemplified in Fig. 1.3.

text          |        More advanced approaches use through silicon vias (TSV) that connect the dies
              | through the bulk of the silicon electrically, while attaching them together with a ball-
              | grid array pattern of solder bumps. Elpida [19] and Samsung [20] have used this
              | technology to manufacture 8 Gbit and 16 Gbit TSV DRAM by stacking 8 thinned dies
              | with 1030 vertical interconnects (Fig. 1.4). Overall, these packaging solutions are viable
              | for applications where interconnect density is not large, with maximum vertical
              | interconnect pitch of 100 μm yielding about 102 mm-2 density.

text          |        The next level of sophistication is die-on-wafer stacking, where known good
              | dies (KGD) are bonded on top a wafer containing other KGD sites. After thinning good
              | dies are bonded using organic glues, oxide bonding or metal (Cu-Cu) bonding, with
              | aligned vertical interconnects. Given the placement accuracy of about 10 μm [21],
              | higher interconnect density can be achieved (102-103 mm-2) [22] with possibility of
              | stacking mixed substrates as long as process temperatures are kept low to avoid unequal
              | expansion. ZyCube has reported three-layer devices using through-die vias, adhesive
              | bonding and micro bumps [23], while Ziptronix uses a process of simultaneous oxide
              | and Cu-Cu bonding [24] and have reduced interconnect pitch down to 8 μm with their
              | DBI® technology at only 350 °C thermal budget [25].

              | much smaller vertical interconnect pitch, and correspondingly higher density. In this
              | method, pre-fabricated wafers with devices and metalization are planarised and attached
              | face-to-face using copper-copper bonding of vertical interconnects, usually at 400-450
              | °C [26]. The back surface of the top layer is thinned to less than 15 μm exposing deep
              | SuperVias® filled with Cu, allowing to extend the process and stack multiple layers
              | (Fig. 1.6). Inter-layer alignment accuracy, as well as management of thermal expansion
              | of substrates during bonding (warping) ultimately set the limits of this technique.
              | Tezzaron’s process consistently achieves alignment accuracy of less than ±1 μm (3σ)
              | across 200 mm wafer [27], allowing for Cu vias of only 1.2 μm width and 2.4 μm pitch
              | for face-to-face bonding [26], reaching 105 mm-2 vertical interconnect density with
              | stacks up to four layers thick. While an impressive feat, it is far from the 2D global
              | wiring pitch of 0.25 μm for the 65 nm technology node (ITRS) [1].

text          | Since the largest impact on 3D via pitch, and therefore density, in wafer stacking
              | technology is due to the wafer-to-wafer overlay tolerance, an alternative approach to
              | form vias after bonding has been pursued by MIT Lincoln Labs, IBM and others [28]
              | (Fig. 1.7). At MIT, fully fabricated SOI wafer pair was oxide-oxide bonded at 150-275

text          | Once the bond was complete, the subsequent tungsten 3D vias could be placed with
              | overlay alignment accuracy of optical lithography, allowing for much smaller size
              | (~1µm diameter) and finer pitch (3.4 µm) [30]. Such technology was utilized to

              | megapixel CMOS 3-D image sensor featuring 100% pixel fill factor [31] and a 3-D
              | laser radar imager [32]. IBM has demonstrated a similar process, except that they rely
              | on a glass handle wafer to transfer fully fabricated SOI device layer (~7µm) onto the 3D
              | stack [33]. The transparent handle wafer allows for through-wafer optical alignment and
              | is easily released by laser ablation of the blanket adhesive layer upon bonding (Fig.
              | 1.9). In addition, the Rensselaer Polytechnic (RPI) approach using polymeric glues such
              | as BCB to bond full wafers of active devices at 300 °C is promising [34], but suffers
              | from outgassing, delamination and alignment limitations. The essence of via-last
              | techniques is that very thin active device layers are accurately transferred, allowing for
              | thin and shallow vertical interconnects to be more densely packed (105-106 mm-2).

text          |        Fabrication of upper layer devices in-situ, requires a couple of fundamental
              | breakthroughs. Firstly, we need a method to obtain device-quality single-crystalline
              | semiconductor material on top of an amorphous substrate. Secondly, once the crystal
              | region is formed, low thermal budget processing of upper devices is crucial to preserve
              | the circuit integrity of underlying layers. Otherwise, dopant redistribution, hillocking or
              | voids in the interconnect lines, as well as degradation of low-k dielectrics could
              | adversely affect existing circuit performance. Generally, a temperature limit of around
              | 400 – 450 °C should be sufficient to preserve aluminum or copper interconnects [35]
              | and low-k dielectrics [36], while maintaining dopant profiles. Much effort has been put
              | into satisfying the second requirement of low-temperature processing. Rajendran et al.

text          |        In the 1980s some of the earliest monolithic 3DICs were implemented using
              | solid phase crystallization (SPC) of deposited amorphous films to build additional
              | devices on top of a layer of pre-fabricated MOSFETs [41,42], a method similar to that
              | used in thin film transistors (TFT) [43]. For instance, a three level monolithic 3DIC
              | achieved at Mitsubishi in 1986 fabricated devices in re-crystallized α-Si at 950°C (Fig.
              | 1.11) [44], while inter-level wiring was completed with doped poly-silicon
              | (interconnect density ~45mm-2). However, these circuits suffered from poor material
              | quality and crystalline defects such as grain boundaries within active devices, ultimately
              | degrading mobility and leakage performance [45]. Moreover, undue thermal cycling
              | negatively impacted the performance of underlying layers (manifested as threshold
              | voltage shifts) [44]. More recently, in an effort to reduce process temperature, catalysts
              | such as Ni, Pd, Co, Al and others [46-49], have been used to induce solid-phase
              | crystallization at temperatures between 300-500°C. While sizeable (~10µm) single
              | crystal grains have been demonstrated, device performance is typically poor [50] due to
              | leftover catalyst in the active device region.

text          |        Another bottom-up scheme adopts epitaxial silicon lateral overgrowth to
              | produce upper layers. Typically a seed window is opened to the underlying device
              | layer, from which epitaxial silicon is selectively grown [51]. Although the material
              | quality is good, the growth temperature is high (900-1000°C) for sufficient overgrowth,
              | which degrades the underlying devices and virtually precludes buried metal
              | interconnects. Recently, the technique has been improved with the use of pulsed or
              | scanned laser annealing combined with lower melting temperature germanium (937°C)
              | as the device material. Thus, rapid melt and subsequent seeded epitaxial growth has
              | been shown to crystallize perfectly oriented and large (~100µm) stripes amenable to
              | 3DIC applications [52-54]. In addition, the method could produce a variety of high
              | quality semiconductor grains (Si, Ge, GaAs) [55,56] on amorphous layers if provided
              | with an easily accessible substrate from which to nucleate. However, opening seed
              | windows through microns thick inter-layer dielectric of multi-layered 3DIC and
              | subsequently bringing the crystal seed up presents a formidable challenge, in addition to
              | the space penalty it incurs.

text          |        Seedless crystallization techniques offer an attractive alternative, since large
              | single-crystalline grains could be formed directly on the top amorphous layer.
              | Pioneering work in the 1970’s and 1980’s involved scanned strip heater ovens and
              | continuous-wave (cw) lasers to melt and recrystallize large areas of amorphous material
              | on quartz substrates for flat panel displays [57-60]. Biegelsen et al. observed the
              | phenomenon of partial melt in radiatively melted silicon, arising from the reflectivity
              | difference between solid and liquid phases. Due to slight advantage in surface energy at
              | the quartz interface, preferentially textured <100> solid lamellae would form within the
              | melt and subsequently seed large <100> out-of-plane oriented grains upon
              | crystallization [61]. While the use of CO2 and Argon cw lasers for partial melt is hardly
              | low-temperature, Witte et al. adapted the process for 3DIC applications by using short
              | pulses of 532 nm Nd:YAG laser [62]. For example, a pulse of 2 ms used to melt 185 nm
              | thick α-Si film on quartz yielded <100> oriented grains several micrometers long [63].
              | However, the orientation effect seems to disappear for pulse lengths shorter than 200
              | µs, limiting the technique’s applicability to monolithic 3DICs. Other seedless

text          |        Graphoepitaxy is another technique that has been demonstrated as a means for
              | fashioning regions of single crystal semiconductors on amorphous substrates [68-72]. In
              | this approach, periodic surface relief structures induce crystallographic orientation in
              | thin films upon solidification. While the mechanism is still uncertain, it most likely
              | relies on surface energy advantages in preferentially oriented grains (see Chapter 2).
              | Earliest results by H.I. Smith et al. showed that strip heater melted 500 nm thick α-Si
              | film deposited over a square grating (3.8µm pitch) etched in quartz substrate
              | crystallized into large and uniformly oriented <100> Si crystal with <001> in-plane-
              | orientation parallel to the grating [69]. However, all of the efforts reported employ high
              | power melting techniques (ovens, cw Ar lasers) while maintaining substantial substrate
              | heating (>800°C) [70], even in the case of Ge graphoepitaxy [73]. Such conditions
              | allow for longer cooling times and increased control over random nucleation and crystal
              | growth, yet they are 3DIC incompatible [74,75]. Chapters 2 and 3 are dedicated to
              | exploring ways to achieve successful graphoepitaxy at reduced process temperature
              | suitable for monolithic 3-D integration.

              | 
text          |        A completely different approach is to directly attach known high quality crystal
              | islands for upper layer device fabrication. The advantage of this technique is that the
              | single crystalline material can be formed or grown separately by conventional means,
              | ensuring a good quality, defect-free device layer. Subsequently, the material is
              | transferred onto the 3DIC wafer using a suitable low-temperature bonding method, and
              | the upper layer device is fabricated via low thermal budget techniques described in the
              | previous section. Unlike wafer stacking, no strict wafer-to-wafer alignment is required
              | during the bonding step, and more importantly, vertical interconnect density is not
              | sacrificed since the approach is monolithic. The main challenge, however, is achieving
              | sufficient bond strength and quality at temperatures compatible with the underlying
              | devices.

text          |        The SOI community pioneered the ‘bond and etch-back SOI’ (BESOI) process
              | to attain full wafer crystalline Si device layer transfer using direct fusion bonding,
              | grinding and etch-back [76,77]. Early demonstrations were plagued by high defect
              | densities at the bonded interface (manifested as trapped particles, bubbles, voids, and
              | delaminated regions), while high temperature post-bonding anneal (typically 800-1100
              | °C) was required to achieve sufficient bond strength (>1 J/m2) [78]. Activation of ultra-
              | smooth (<5Å RMS) mating surfaces by plasma [79] or chemical [80] means prior to
              | bonding have strengthened the attachment considerably while also lowering required
              | anneal temperature [81]. In addition, the removal of the bulk donor wafer has become
              | much simpler with the hydrogen ion induced layer-splitting process (SmartCut®) [82],
              | eliminating the grinding and etching steps. With these advances, very thin crystal layers
              | were transferred to make strained Si-, SiGe- and Ge-on-insulator (GeOI) substrates up
              | to 200mm in diameter [83,84]. Soon thereafter, initial attempts were made at building
              | monolithic 3DICs by transferring thin Si [85] or Ge [86] crystal layers onto
              | prefabricated wafers, but they suffered from weak bonds and defects inherent in large
              | area layer transfers. Therefore, to address the need for strong, void-free and low-

text          |        An architectural scheme involving multiple layers of active transistors stacked
              | one above the other and connected to each other has been proposed to address the
              | interconnect bottleneck associated with two dimensional Integrated Circuits (ICs) [35].
              | Such three dimensional structures have been fabricated by bonding pre-fabricated
              | circuits together. However, the vertical interconnect density of these systems has been
              | limited to about 106 vertical wires/mm2 due to factors such as alignment limitations of
              | wafer bonding, mismatch in the thermal expansion coefficients of different materials
              | and particle contamination [75]. In a monolithic approach, the upper level circuits are
              | fabricated in situ on thin single crystal films (<200nm thick), alleviating alignment
              | requirements and enabling much larger interconnect density. However, a practical

title         | 2.1 Introduction to graphoepitaxy
blank         | 
text          |        Graphoepitaxy is a technique that uses artificial surface relief structures to
              | induce crystallographic orientation in thin films. Since the starting surface material of
              | graphoepitaxy is amorphous and thus atomically disordered, carefully designed periodic
              | structures are fashioned to create a template, which closely mimics the desired
              | crystalline structure. Similarly to the process of heteroepitaxy, where the lattice of an
              | underlying crystalline material imparts the crystal orientation, a deposited material

              | due to the underlying artificial relief pattern. Because epitaxy occurs on a substrate that
              | has been pre-written or drawn, the process is named graphoepitaxy [68].

              | 
text          |        The mechanism for graphoepitaxial orientation relies on surface energy
              | anisotropy between different crystal planes and the amorphous material of the template.
              | Considering a hypothetical columnar grain of area A and thickness h, the Gibbs free
              | energy ΔE can be expressed as [71]:
blank         | 
text          |                         ΔE = AhΔGV + Alsγ ls + 2 Aγ ss
blank         | 
text          | where ΔGv is bulk free energy, γss is the grain-template interfacial surface energy, γls is
              | the grain-liquid surface energy, Als is the interface area between the solid grain and
              | liquid surrounding, and it is assumed the top and bottom surfaces are identical for
              | simplicity. If we compare the contribution of the last term for grains with orientations
              | that minimize surface energy, γmin, with the average surface energy of all grains, γav, we
              | can define a measure of surface energy anisotropy:

text          |                                     Δγ = γ av − γ min
              | Then, the free energy advantage ΔFS of a grain that minimizes surface energy,
              | normalized per unit volume becomes [71]:
blank         | 
text          |                         ΔFS = −2 A ⋅ Δγ / hA = −2Δγ / h
              | This reduction in surface energy component drives the preferential orientation of
              | graphoepitaxial films. As expected, greater degree of anisotropy Δγ accentuates the
              | effect, but more significantly, energy reduction increases with decreasing film
              | thickness.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        Finally, it is important to note that minimizing interfacial energy on a smooth
              | amorphous surface would yield a preferential texture, or out-of-plane orientation,
              | leaving the in-plane orientation random. The presence of artificial structures does
              | increase the surface area, but it also creates local energy minima for particular
              | azimuthal, or in-plane orientations [70]. Therefore, surface relief structures provide an
              | additional constraint that limits the degree of freedom to a unique crystal in-plane-
              | orientation that simultaneously minimizes interfacial energy over the complete surface.
              | For example, the cubic crystals of KCl are neatly oriented on top of a square-wave
              | grating in SiO2 substrate (Fig. 2.1). Crystal <100> planes have the minimum surface

              | crystallographic orientation of deposited silicon films [68]. The melting and
              | recrystallization of these thin films (500 nm thick) has been performed using strip-
              | heater ovens as well as by scanned continuous wave (cw) lasers. In both of these
              | methods, the substrate was temperature biased to a large fraction of the melting
              | temperature, allowing for a slow cooling rate of the molten silicon film. Such conditions
              | produced highly oriented single-crystal grains over 10 µm in size, with both in and out-

text          |        The grating pattern was generated in thermally grown SiO2 using nanoimprint

text          |        We used continuous-wave laser exposure at 1 to 2 MW/cm2 power densities in
              | order to ensure melting of the semiconductor layer. The effect of laser recrystallization
              | of a 500 nm thick α-Si film can be seen in (Fig. 2.9a). Three distinct regions are
              | observable following the exposure. First, near the center of the laser beam, large crystal
              | grains spanning the thickness of the film can be detected (Fig. 2.9b). Second, away from
              | the melted region, there is an area of solid-phase crystallized silicon with fine
              | polycrystalline structure (Fig. 2.9c). Finally, outside the annealed region is the original
              | deposited amorphous silicon layer (Fig. 2.9d). In addition, we found that thick capping

              | silicon melting process. Otherwise, the surface tension of liquid silicon on SiO2 caused

text          |        Taking a closer look at the large crystal grains in the 100 nm thick cw laser
              | recrystallized Si film, it appears that individual grains are confined to the regions
              | between NIL patterned gratings with grain boundaries meeting regularly on top of the
              | patterned lines (Fig. 2.10). In addition, the lateral extent of each crystalline grain of the
              | thin Si film seems to be limited by the pitch of the SiO2 grating, in this case 190 nm.
              | Therefore the TEM micrographs suggest that nano-gratings in SiO2 substrates can
              | determine the size and boundary location of grains in recrystallized α-Si films.
              | However, convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns of each individual
              | grain indicate that there is no obvious preferential orientation of Si grains. Studies by
              | Givargizov et al. [72] suggest that the shape and radius of curvature of artificial patterns
              | is of critical importance in defining crystal orientation. For example, in the case of a
              | NIL patterned square grating, vertical walls with 90° sharp corners are desirable to
              | impart <100> in-plane orientation onto adjoining silicon crystal grains. Therefore, the
              | slightly rounded features of SiO2 grating evident in Fig. 2.9 and 2.10 may be
              | responsible for the apparent lack of preferential orientation.

text          |        Two possible reasons for the lack of crystal orientation by graphoepitaxy have
              | been identified: template imperfection and incomplete melt of irradiated films. One-
              | dimensional nano-grating fabricated by NIL allows for smaller pitch templates, but
              | shallow trench depths and limitations of RIE process cause rounded corners and non-
              | vertical sidewalls, which ultimately compromise the geometry of the template that is
              | supposed to impart graphoepitaxial orientation. Moreover, high temperatures required
              | to melt Si also lead to plastic flow deformation of the SiO2 grating further degrading the
              | template, as seen in the solid-phase graphoepitaxy experiments.

              | 
text          |        The second possible cause of randomly oriented grains in recrystallized Si films
              | is incomplete melt of the full thickness of the film. In particular, small, randomly
              | oriented crystallites formed at the SiO2 interface either during α-Si deposition process
              | (at 585 °C) or by solid phase epitaxy may effectively mask the nano-grating template.
              | During the laser pulse anneal, if these bottom-most crystallites are not melted, they then

              | 
text          |        To achieve sharper template geometry (radius of curvature at corners, rc, less
              | than 5 nm), orientation dependent etching of silicon was used to produce an array of
              | inverted pyramids with lattice defined sharp corners (Fig. 2.13b). Starting with a (100)
              | silicon wafer, 35 nm thick Si3N4 layer was deposited by LPCVD before spinning on 2%
              | 950K PMMA resist. An array of 500 nm squares was patterned on a 700 nm square grid
              | using a Raith 150 electron beam exposure tool. The pattern was transferred to the Si3N4
              | layer using reactive ion etching, and the exposed silicon was anisotropically etched in
              | 30% KOH solution at 80 °C for 2 minutes, resulting in a periodic array of inverted
              | pyramids (Fig. 2.13c). After removing the remaining silicon nitride hard mask in hot
              | phosphoric acid, the crystalline nature of silicon was effectively masked by growing a

              | 2 µm sized islands that caused the LTO cap to lift. Liquid silicon de-wets SiO2 surfaces
              | with a contact angle of 87° [94], and the reduction in Gibbs free energy per unit volume
              | is inversely proportional to the film thickness, making thinner films more likely to

text          |        The observed graphoepitaxial effect on crystal orientation is most likely due to
              | the two-dimensional nature of the inverted pyramid array as well as the high fidelity of
              | the amorphous template. Due to orientation dependent etching in KOH, the SiO2
              | template closely mimics the geometry of a diamond crystal lattice, characteristic of
              | group IV semiconductors. Unlike the one-dimensional square grating, the inverted
              | pyramid array constrains two in-plane degrees of freedom and consequently improves
              | orientation control by establishing a local energy minimum for a particular in-plane
              | grain orientation that matches the template. In earlier work, A. Giermann and C.V.

              | case to achieve a periodic array of crystallographically oriented gold metal particles

text          |          Earlier work by H.I. Smith et al. [92] demonstrated graphoepitaxial orientation
              | of partially melted Si films in which the last surviving grains that were not melted by a
              | strip-heater or scanned cw laser would serve as nucleation sites that would grow and
              | coalesce into oriented films. This technique of ‘survival of the fittest’ relies on the
              | elevated melting temperature of grains that have energetically favourable orientation
              | relative to the amorphous substrate. In contrast, in this experiment complete melt and
              | agglomeration occur, eliminating seeded grain growth from either SPC region or
              | unmelted grains. Such seedless condition would normally cause uncontrolled and
              | spontaneous crystallization to occur in an undercooled melt. However, due to the fact
              | that the melted top layer of the silicon substrate releases its latent heat as it solidifies, it
              | maintains the (much smaller) molten Si film close to the melting point. This in turn
              | limits the undercooling of the liquid melt and allows for near-equilibrium growth of
              | grains where energetic considerations become pronounced and graphoepitaxy takes
              | place.

              | using pulsed laser anneal is presented in Fig. 2.19. All of the crystallized grains shown
              | have in-plane (azimuthal) orientation matching the Si substrate (±1°), suggesting strong
              | influence of the amorphous 2D template. However, the out-of-plane orientation is
              | graphoepitaxally aligned <100> only for the narrow sliver emanating from the left
              | corner, while the rest of the agglomerate is a <111> twin grain at 70.6° out-of-plane tilt
              | with respect to the substrate. Formation of twin boundaries such as these in silicon is
              | very common due to their low energy cost: γtwin ~ 34 mJ/m2, compared to a regular
              | grain boundary γgb ~ 273 mJ/m2 [97]. While we can only speculate on the nucleation
              | location and the direction of grain growth, the data does support the notion that crystal
              | grains with graphoepitaxial orientations with respect to 2D patterned amorphous SiO2
              | substrates are more likely to form than others.

text          |         Considering a 3DIC compatible structure with 8 μm thick insulating SiO2 layer,
              | the top silicon layer can be melted using a 10 μs pulse without raising the substrate
              | temperature above 450 °C (Fig. 2.20). In this case, the thin film crystallizes over about a
              | microsecond, denoted by a constant temperature region of solidification following the
              | laser pulse. Modeling of the same structure, but with the substrate temperature biased to
              | 1000 °C where lower laser power is required to melt the silicon film, reveals that
              | crystallization occurs over a much longer timescale of tens of microseconds. Thus, for
              | the experiment of graphoepitaxy on an inverted pyramid template, the inadvertent
              | melting of the underlying substrate significantly reduces vertical heat flow rates,
              | limiting undercooling and producing temperature profiles much like the case of 1000 °C
              | substrate temperature biasing. Such conditions suppress spontaneous random
              | nucleation, and allow for graphoepitaxially-oriented grains to grow (see Chapter 3).

blank         | 
text          |        Another potential avenue for achieving oriented semiconductor crystals on
              | amorphous substrates is by solid phase graphoepitaxy. T. Yonehara et al. [98,99]
              | demonstrated graphoepitaxy of thin Ge films on SiO2 by solid-state surface energy
              | driven grain growth. The mechanism is as follows: primary crystallization process
              | transforms an amorphous thin film into a mosaic of randomly oriented columnar grains,
              | with diameters similar to film thickness. Upon further annealing, secondary grains that
              | are graphoepitaxially oriented (i.e. the sum of the top and bottom surface energies is
              | minimum) grow by consuming neighbouring grains. Since minimum surface energy
              | generally corresponds to a specific crystallographic orientation, the resulting grains
              | should have a uniform texture, and due to the grating, also a uniform azimuthal
              | orientation. Consequently, these secondary grains grow, impinge and coalesce forming
              | large areas of oriented crystal material, as described by C.V. Thompson [71,100,101].

text          |        Yonehara’s template was a 200 nm pitch square grating with 10 nm deep steps
              | in SiO2, while the thin (20 nm) films of Ge annealed at 900 °C for 16 hours produced
              | large (5 µm) secondary grains with <100> texture and <100> orientation parallel to the
              | grating axis. The solid-phase graphoepitaxy took place at a temperature quite close to
              | melting point of germanium (TM = 937 °C). However, the process temperature could be
              | lowered to 3DIC compatible levels, albeit at the expense of slower grain growth.

text          |         Further characterization of NIL samples by cross-sectional TEM offers clues as
              | to why solid phase graphoepitaxy did not take place. The initial amorphous Si film (Fig.
              | 2.22a) starts crystallizing upon a 24 hour anneal at 600 °C. The relatively low
              | temperature of 600 °C reduces the rate of nucleation, allowing for the grains that do
              | nucleate to grow large (~200 nm) before impinging on another grain (Fig. 2.22b).
              | However, the grain grows slowly and is full of internal defects such as stacking faults,
              | twins and dislocations. In addition, microdiffraction (CBED) patterns showed no
              | preferential crystallographic orientation, suggesting that graphoepitaxial preference
              | does not take place during grain nucleation stage. Samples annealed at 1100 °C for 1-
              | hour (Fig. 2.22c) show smaller grains (~50 nm), but with fewer defects. Their
              | orientation is also random, while the SiO2 grating itself has become rounded. After 24
              | hours at 1100 °C (Fig. 2.22d), the NIL grating has completely lost its shape, resulting in
              | a smooth bump. In addition, secondary grain growth has increased the grain size to
              | more than 200 nm, while lattice defects are almost eliminated. However, the larger
              | grains still have no preferential orientation, confirming the XRD results.

text          |         Therefore, the effect of artificial surface patterns altering crystallographic
              | texture reported in literature has not been observed in these thin Si films. A few things
              | could cause the lack of graphoepitaxial orientation. Firstly, the 1D nano-grating
              | degraded significantly at high temperatures due to softening of fused silica substrate.
              | The lack of geometrically defined template directly undermines the preferential growth
              | of oriented grains via surface energy anisotropy. Secondly, the anneal temperature of
              | 1100 °C is more than 300 °C below the melting point of silicon (TM=1412 °C). Given
              | that Yonehara et al. annealed Ge films only 37 °C below melting, the 1100 °C used for
              | Si may be insufficient to achieve significant secondary grain growth and thus
              | orientation effects in Si thin films.

text          |        In conclusion, solid phase graphoepitaxy of silicon seems difficult to achieve,

              | required to achieve appreciable secondary grain growth, while such thermal excursions
              | also damage the template intended to orient the crystallizing films. Even with lower
              | melting point semiconductor materials such as germanium, 900°C+ temperatures

              | occurs within 60 ns of the laser pulse (278 mJ/cm2 fluence). Because the fused silica
              | bulk is at room temperature, the ensuing vertical cooling rates exceed 1010 °C/s.
              | Consequently, substantial undercooling takes place, triggering rapid spontaneous
              | nucleation resulting in fine grain polycrystalline film which M. Hatano et al. observed.
              | Thin Si films on patterned fused silica behaved similarly, with uncontrolled
              | spontaneous nucleation (both heterogeneous and homogeneous) seeding randomly
              | oriented grains that barely grew 10-50 nm before completely solidifying the film.

text          |        Achieving large grain growth in excimer laser melted Si films is therefore
              | unlikely. The uncontrolled spontaneous nucleation of rapidly cooling melt prevents any
              | appreciable grain growth. Moreover, the fast cooling Si system is far from equilibrium,
              | so the surface energy advantage of graphoepitaxially-oriented grains is not pronounced.
              | Therefore, the biggest advantage of short pulse excimer laser anneals, i.e. keeping the
              | lower layers cool and 3DIC compatible, directly causes large thermal gradients and fast
              | cooling rates that ultimately prohibit graphoepitaxy from taking place.

text          |        Scanning cw laser can anneal large areas quickly without excessive heating of
              | the substrate. Depending on the scanning speed and beam size, the dwell time, or
              | duration the laser irradiates any single point, can be made quite short and therefore
              | suitable for 3DIC applications. In the following section we explore the feasibility of

text          |        Differing crystallographic orientations of grains produce a visible contrast in

              | using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) [111] confirms that the recrystallized Ge
              | film consists of randomly oriented zigzag grains. Most likely, the first scan produced
              | randomly oriented crystallites; either by solid phase crystallization or from liquid (left
              | side of Fig. 2.25b). Consequently, these crystallites seeded grain growth into the Ge
              | melt created by subsequent laser scans, incrementally propagating the grains to the right
              | and forming the characteristic zigzag pattern. Therefore, the crystalline orientation is
              | determined by the random seeding of the first scan line rather than the square-grating
              | template, explaining the lack of graphoepitaxial orientation. In effect, the presence of
              | Ge crystallites allows epitaxial growth of existing grains with is energetically favoured
              | over the formation of a completely new Ge heterogeneous nucleation site on the SiO2

text          |        Therefore, graphoepitaxy does not take place in films melted by scanning cw
              | laser, since the 1D template is rendered ineffective by the presence of randomly
              | oriented crystallites of the initial raster scan that seed all subsequent grain growth. One
              | possible avenue of selecting preferential crystal orientation in scanned laser anneals is
              | that of orientation filtering by crystal growth velocity competition [67]. Certain crystal
              | orientations have kinetically faster lateral growth rates, which allow them to expand at
              | the expense of slower growing grains. While this effect has been observed in the
              | scanned anneal of α-Ge film, the technique was not fully investigated.

text          |        We proposed a few methods of achieving single crystal regions of silicon over
              | amorphous SiO2 layers using nano-graphoepitaxy of deposited α-Si films and transient
              | laser annealing. Our one-dimensional numerical simulation showed that it is feasible to
              | use pulsed laser annealing to melt deposited layers of α-Si on the upper levels while
              | keeping within the thermal budget of the underlying circuits. In particular, for a 15 µs
              | pulse, 5 μm thick SiO2 insulating layer would limit temperature excursion at the lower
              | device level to 450 °C. The experiments using cw laser anneals indicated that patterned

              | 
text          |        In addition, alternative transient heating approaches of excimer or scanned cw
              | lasers were employed to melt thin semiconductor films deposited on square-wave
              | grating template. While crystallizing grains from 30 nm to several micrometers in size,
              | neither method demonstrated graphoepitaxial orientation effect. On the other end of the
              | spectrum, solid phase graphoepitaxy required anneal temperatures far in excess of 3DIC
              | limits to grow high quality semiconductor grains on 1-D templated amorphous
              | substrate.

              | 
text          |        Consequently, we applied a two-dimensional (2-D) template of inverted pyramid
              | structures to achieve graphoepitaxy of thin silicon films using pulsed laser annealing.
              | Experiments showed significant agglomeration of molten silicon on SiO2 surface, even
              | with 1.2 µm LTO cap present. Nonetheless, the resulting silicon islands contained
              | grains with a high degree of both in-plane and out-of-plane orientation matching that of
              | the underlying template. In addition, crystal grains up to 500 nm in diameter were
              | found to be virtually defect-free and limited by twin grain boundaries emanating from
              | template asperities. Closer examination of the thermal profiles during laser annealing
              | revealed significant heating of the substrate, which facilitated the growth of large and

text          |        The results of graphoepitaxy experiments that used transient laser annealing
              | showed very little graphoepitaxial orientation in recrystallized Si or Ge films (see Table

              | orientation, most grains ended up randomly oriented and usually much smaller than a
              | micron in size. On the other hand, large and highly oriented films achieved by

text          |        The process of solidification of liquid semiconductor material into crystalline

text          |        In order to investigate crystallization phenomena in undercooled semiconductor

              | of a 100 nm thick layer of amorphous germanium on top of oxidized Si substrate,
              | capped with 100 nm of SiO2. Germanium was specifically chosen so that crystallization

              | could be examined and compared. In particular, lower melting temperature of Ge

title         | 3.4 Algorithm
blank         | 
text          |        Our simulation algorithm first calculates the temperature evolution of molten Ge
              | in a simplified 1-D structure presented in Figure 3.4 using the one dimensional heat
              | diffusion model [37,62]. As the Ge liquid undercools from the initial 937 °C, the heat
              | diffuses through 200 nm of SiO2 into the underlying Si substrate, which acts as a heat
              | sink. Radiative and convective losses are comparatively negligible, and are therefore
              | ignored. Similarly, Si (100) seed only serves as an interface for seeded epitaxial growth
              | of germanium. To simplify the simulation, Ge undercooled liquid is considered
              | isothermal with no local thermal gradients. Therefore, the latent heat released during
              | phase transition is instantaneous and accounted for globally, slowing down the cooling
              | rate of the remaining Ge liquid.

              | 
text          |        The crystallizing layer of liquid Ge is represented by a 2-D finite element mesh
              | with 1 nm spatial resolution. At each time step (1 ns long), homogenous and
              | heterogeneous nucleation rates, as well as crystal growth velocity, are calculated for the
              | prevailing temperature. Consequently, Monte Carlo method is used to determine
              | whether spontaneous nucleation takes place at each mesh element: heterogeneous for
              | perimeter elements at SiO2 interface, or homogeneous for bulk elements. Once a
              | nucleus appears, it increases in size isotropically, growing into the undercooled liquid at
              | calculated growth velocity until it impinges upon other grains or the SiO2 interface. In

              | crystal is assumed to be immediate even though there may be some delay involved due

text          |        Our simulation algorithm has been first used to model crystallization of
              | amorphous Ge melted using pulsed laser anneal and in absence of any crystal seed.
              | Upon laser melting, the liquid Ge (at 937 °C) creates a large vertical thermal gradient
              | with respect to the Si substrate, which is held at temperatures below 400 °C for 3DIC
              | compatibility. As the heat diffuses through the 200 nm thick SiO2 layer, the liquid
              | quickly undercools at an approximate rate of –300 °C/µs. Without a crystalline seed to
              | nucleate growth, Ge continues to undercool until at critical temperature spontaneous
              | random nucleation is triggered. Consequently, an avalanche of heterogeneous nuclei
              | appear at the SiO2 interface seeding many grains that quickly grow into the remaining
              | undercooled liquid. In turn, these expanding grains impinge upon each other, resulting
              | in fine grain polycrystalline Ge structure (Fig. 3.5).

text          |        Assuming that graphoepitaxy is fundamentally a preferential nucleation process
              | [70], heterogeneous nuclei of preferential crystal orientation should be energetically
              | favoured. Therefore statistically, they should appear on the amorphous SiO2 template
              | before the randomly oriented spontaneous nuclei. However, H.I. Smith et al. [92] have
              | calculated that melting temperature of preferentially oriented Si grain to be less than a
              | degree (<1°C) higher than the average randomly oriented one. Such a notion would
              | suggest that preferential nucleation of graphoepitaxial grains in undercooled liquid
              | should also occur only a degree or so before general spontaneous nucleation begins.
              | Consequently, cooling rates would need to be sufficiently slow (<<1°C/µs) to allow for
              | appreciable growth of graphoepitaxial grains before being drowned out by random
              | heterogeneous nucleation.

text          |        Successful demonstrations of Si or Ge graphoepitaxy [93,68,73,98] inevitably
              | use thermal biasing of the substrate or high power IR strip heaters to ensure reduced
              | cooling rates, which effectively suppress random nucleation. In the case of 3DIC

title         | 4.1 Introduction
blank         | 
text          |        In an effort to identify a low-temperature bonding technique that would satisfy
              | many of the requirements needed for successful monolithic 3D integration, we propose
              | aluminum-germanium (Al-Ge) eutectic bonding. Al-Ge has been effectively used to
              | package and hermetically seal fabricated MEMS devices, thanks to the eutectic liquid
              | alloy that forms at the bonding interface at 424 °C [125]. This transition to liquid phase
              | at the eutectic temperature is the key advantage of all eutectic bonding techniques,
              | including the more familiar gold-silicon eutectic bonding (Au-Si) at 363 °C [126].
              | Consequently, the Al-Ge eutectic alloys have been shown to generate strong and void-
              | free bonds, even on rough surfaces. Furthermore, Al-Ge could be particularly applicable
              | to 3D integration, given that the materials involved are CMOS process compatible
              | (unlike Au-Si), and could also provide a conductive path upon bonding. However, the
              | processes so far reported [127-129] are not suitable for 3DICs, having either too high a
              | bonding temperature or pressure or requiring excessively thick films (~4 µm).

              | used for wafer scale integration. Fracture energy of the bond was measured, and the
              | interface microstructure examined by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), focused-ion-
              | beam (FIB), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ultimately, the new and
              | improved Al-Ge eutectic bonding technique was applied to attach silicon islands for
              | monolithic 3DIC integration.

text          |        Al-Ge eutectic bonding was tested using 100 mm diameter n-type Si (100)
              | wafers that have been RCA cleaned and thermally oxidized to create typically 100 nm
              | of SiO2. This layer serves as a diffusion barrier during bonding. Blanket aluminum and
              | germanium films were deposited sequentially onto the wafers using Innotec ES26C E-
              | beam evaporator in a single pump down. The samples were cleaned in Piranha solution
              | (H2SO4:H2O2 = 4:1 at 120 °C) for 20 min, followed by deionised water (DI) rinse and
              | spin drying prior to being introduced into the chamber. The wafer temperature never
              | exceeded 40 °C during evaporation, while the deposition rate was ~5 Å/s for both
              | materials. Germanium was chosen as the capping layer because it is much easier to
              | chemically remove native germanium oxide (GeO2), which is soluble in water,
              | compared to native aluminum oxide (Al2O3). The thicknesses of the films deposited
              | were chosen to match the Al-Ge eutectic composition (70 at% Al and 30 at% Ge),
              | which should melt at the eutectic temperature of TE = 424 °C (Fig. 4.1) [125] and thus
              | form the bond. Taking into account the densities (ρ) and atomic weights (A) of Al and
              | Ge, the ratio of thicknesses could be calculated as:

              | sided). The one sided configuration had Al-Ge film deposited only on one of the two
              | mating wafers (the other wafer had bare SiO2), while the two-sided configuration had
              | Al-Ge on both. Immediately prior to bonding, both wafers to be bonded were dipped in
              | dilute hydrofluoric acid (2% HF) for 30 s to remove native germanium oxides, followed
              | by DI water rinse and spin dry. Megasonic DI water jet clean was also used to remove

text          |         To test structural integrity of the Al-Ge eutectic bond, razor blade insertion test
              | was performed on all of the bonded wafer pairs (see Table 4.1). They all remained
              | intact, i.e. there was no wafer-scale splitting. After applying significant force, small
              | pieces at the edge would chip off, cracking through the silicon bulk. Only the wafer
              | pairs bonded by 48 nm Al-Ge bilayer at 435 °C did show some weakness, having larger
              | pieces split off.

text          |         Quantitative measurement of the bond strength was accomplished using double
              | cantilever beam (DCB) thin-film adhesion measurement technique [130]. DCB method
              | was chosen because it is accurate and yields repeatable measurements with low scatter.
              | In this technique, the adhesive failure of the bond at interface between two materials
              | can be modeled as a crack propagating along that interface, allowing one to apply
              | theories of fracture mechanics originally developed for bulk materials. Adhesion is
              | characterized by measuring the amount of energy required, per unit area, to propagate
              | the crack along an interface (Gc). This value is a quantity known in fracture mechanics
              | as the critical crack extension force.

text          |        In the double cantilever beam configuration, the ends of Al-Ge bonded beams

              | the beams apart (P) causes bending of the beams that stores elastic strain energy. This
              | energy is released as the crack extends along the interface, defining a debonding length
              | (a). Consequently, the crack extension force (Gc) generated during the DCB experiment
              | can be calculated from [130] using the following approximation:

              | method is considered a pure mode I (tension) fracture strength measurement,
              | distinguishing it from mode II (shear) or mixed mode techniques [131]. This property is
              | significant, as it minimizes plastic deformation (Gp) component of the fracture energy
              | (Gc), and thus measures the chemical work of adhesion (Go) component. Therefore,
              | using DCB method would give the mode I value of Gc ≈ Go, which is a more
              | representative measure of bond toughness [132]. Finally, mode I measurements are best
              | for measuring cohesive failure (which occurs within the bulk of the bonding material,
              | such as the case of the AlGe samples), while mixed mode measurements are better at

              | around surface roughness. Thus, unlike solid phase thermo-compressive bonding (e.g.

              | diffusing silicon atoms [136] from entering Al-Ge eutectic system from the bulk. Such a
              | barrier is required because the presence of elemental silicon creates Al-Si-Ge tertiary
              | alloy whose melting temperature is higher than 424 °C [125]. Consequently, the tertiary
              | non-eutectic composition would prevent melting during bonding, thus degrading the
              | quality of the bond. It should be noted that a conductive material, such as thin titanium
              | nitride (TiN), could be used as a Si diffusion barrier [137]. Silicon diffusivity in fine-
              | grain TiN at 600 °C is about 1 x 10-20 m2/s [138], making it an excellent diffusion
              | barrier. Consequently, Al-Ge bond layer could be utilized as a conductive path going
              | through TiN barrier for backside contacts or other such applications.

text          |        However, the most remarkable property of eutectic Al-Ge bonding is the ability

              | bonding, which requires optically smooth wafers to allow short range attractive van der

              | 
text          |        The donor wafer was removed by annealing the Al-Ge bonded pair at 400 °C for
              | 12 hours. The molecular hydrogen pockets thus coalesced and the internal pressure split
              | the wafers. However, it is critical to set the H+ implant dose low enough, such that
              | SmartCut splitting does not occur prematurely during the Al-Ge bonding step at 435 °C.
              | The reason is that hydrogen splitting requires rigid surfaces for cooperative thin film
              | exfoliation [144,145]. If the splitting occurs while Al-Ge eutectic melt is present,
              | irregular and localized transfer occurs, since the liquid Al-Ge bond does not anchor the
              | islands well to withstand the mechanical forces involved. A possible alternative is to use
              | razor cleaving instead of thermal treatment to induce splitting [83].

title         | 4.9 Sub-eutectic Al-Ge bonding
blank         | 
text          |        In the interest of having a fully low-temperature 3DIC process with all
              | constituent steps at 400 °C or below, the feasibility of sub-eutectic AlGe bonding at 400
              | °C has been investigated. Because the bonding takes place below eutectic temperature
              | (424 °C), no melt occurs within the Al-Ge bilayer such that atomic diffusion takes place
              | in solid phase. In this regard, the mechanism of sub-eutectic Al-Ge bonding should be
              | similar to the solid phase thermo-compressive techniques such as Cu-Cu bonding.

text          |        As expected, the cross-sectional image shows the presence of the original

              | However, the initial bilayer structure has completely disappeared, having been replaced
              | by distinct columnar grains. Remarkably, even without liquid eutectic condition, solid
              | phase diffusion of Al and Ge atoms has laterally segregated the alloy into its separate
              | phases. The bright regions in the SEM have been confirmed to have high Ge content,
              | while the dark ones consist of majority Al material. Such profound reorganization could
              | explain the surprising strength of the sub-eutectic Al-Ge bond, since highly mobile
              | surface atoms could also cross onto the mating wafer forming a solid physical bond.
              | Therefore, the contact area between the mating surfaces ultimately limits the strength

title         | 4.10 Conclusions
blank         | 
text          |        Aluminum-germanium eutectic bonding has been successfully demonstrated at
              | 435 °C using a bilayer film as thin as 157 nm, making it a viable method for 3DIC
              | integration. The liquid phase of the eutectic material offers versatility, ensuring
              | excellent uniformity and defect-free interface, even when bonding rough surfaces.
              | Dendritic microstructure of the formed Al-Ge eutectic bond produces formidable
              | strength (50 J/m2), creating a solid bond that gives high transfer yields when combined
              | with SmartCut® release process. Moreover, sub-eutectic Al-Ge bonds formed at 400 °C
              | proved nearly as successful in attaching semiconductor islands onto amorphous
              | substrates. Finally, the conductive nature of Al-Ge layer, as well as its compatibility
              | with standard CMOS processing techniques, makes Al-Ge eutectic bonding particularly
              | suitable for monolithic 3DICs.

title         | 5.1 Introduction
blank         | 
text          |        As the IC interconnect dimensions keep shrinking, the use of copper metal is
              | regaining popularity. Compared to aluminum, copper is electro-migration resistant, has
              | higher electrical conductivity as well as higher thermal conductivity, promising better
              | electrical performance, reduced Joule heating and efficient heat transfer [146,147].
              | These advantageous properties of copper make it equally attractive for vertical
              | interconnects of 3DICs. Using copper-copper bonds to attach different layers of a 3DIC
              | would not only provide a strong mechanical attachment, but also serve as a conductive
              | path as well as a built-in heat channel. Consequently, Cu-Cu bonding is positioned as
              | one of the best candidates for achieving 3DIC integration.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        Two main integration approaches that use copper-based bonding are die-to-
              | wafer integration [23-27,148] and full wafer stacking for 3DICs [28-33]. Both of them
              | rely on solid-phase surface diffusion of copper atoms to form the bond, under thermo-
              | compressive conditions. In addition, Ziptronix Inc. has recently developed an aligned
              | dual-bonding approach that combines the positive aspects of Cu bonding with low-
              | temperature fusion bonding process [25]. In this hybrid method, the structural
              | attachment is arguably achieved by SiO2-SiO2 bond, while the adjacent Cu-Cu bonds
              | mainly serve for electrical contact. Regardless of the detailed mechanism, with
              | successful bonds reported at temperatures as low as 300 °C [149], the pure Cu-Cu
              | bonding approach is certainly compatible with back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing
              | conditions, and therefore suitable for both wafer stacking and monolithic 3DIC
              | techniques.

title         | 5.2 Mechanism
blank         | 
text          |        The fundamental mechanism of thermo-compressive metal bonding is that of
              | interfacial atomic diffusion [150-152]. The metal atoms, in this case copper, move
              | along the solid metal surface and upon contact with the metal layer of the mating wafer,
              | form a bond. Collective movement of surface copper atoms allows for microscopic
              | plastic deformation, smoothing the surface asperities, and so creating a larger area of
              | contact between the bonding wafers. It is important to note that the Cu bonding process
              | takes place in solid phase, far away from the Cu melting temperature of TM = 1084 °C.
              | The thermal bias increases the metal atom diffusivity (and mobility), while the
              | compressive pressure mechanically forces the wafers into intimate contact. Such
              | thermo-compressive conditions aid in increasing the effective area of contact for
              | bonding to occur. Finally, after sufficient bonding time at elevated temperature and
              | pressure, the atomic reorganization at the interface allows the copper layers to fuse,
              | forming a strong structural bond as well as a conductive and thermal channel.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        Since successful bonding is dependent of atomic diffusion across the Cu-Cu
              | interface, the condition of the surface is paramount. Any dust or other particle
              | contamination can severely limit the contact area, and thus cause unwanted interfacial
              | voids. In addition, any real metal surfaces are never perfectly flat but microscopically
              | rough, hence the true contact area between wafers can be much smaller than the
              | nominal area [153]. Finally, native oxide formation on the metal surface could further
              | hinder the bonding process by presenting a barrier to atomic interface diffusion.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        Therefore, to accomplish a copper-copper thermo-compressive bond, one would
              | ideally need a particle free, low roughness and oxide free copper surface. Otherwise,
              | any impediment to surface atomic diffusion would require higher temperature, higher
              | pressure or longer bond time to compensate.

              | Application of contact theory to metal-metal bonding of silicon wafers [155], did

              | believed to be as follows [149]:

text          |        The effect of dilute hydrochloric acid dip on surface roughness is shown in
              | Figure 5.2. Increased copper film roughness is due to the fact that dilute HCl also etches
              | Cu. There may be alternative treatments such as glacial acetic acid solution at 35 °C
              | [157] that not only removes native oxide, but also significantly decrease reoxidation

text          |        The results of the wafer saw dicing test of Cu-Cu bonded wafers are
              | summarized in Table 5.1. Overall, the vast majority of the dies in all three samples

              | copper bond toughness to be 2.5 J/m2 in pure tension loading and 17 J/m2 under mixed-
              | mode loading conditions [134,159]. Therefore, it would be safe to conclude that Cu-Cu
              | bonding at 400 °C forms a sufficiently strong bond for 3DIC applications, including the

blank         | 
text          |        Thermo-compressive Cu-Cu bonding is an attractive method for attachment of
              | crystalline Si and Ge islands for upper layers of a 3DIC. With uniform pressure
              | application, and reasonably smooth surfaces (< 2 nm RMS), successful transfer of Si
              | and Ge islands is achievable at 400°C or below. The resulting bonds tend to be
              | homogenous, void-free and mechanically strong, and in addition also serve as effective
              | electrical and heat channels.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        However, copper is not considered a CMOS friendly material due to deep level
              | trap formation in Si and Ge crystal lattices, and therefore must be isolated by diffusion
              | barriers similar to those in back-end copper metal interconnects. At the same time, one
              | must concede that the crystal islands for active layers of a 3DIC would be bonded
              | directly on top of such back-end metalization layers, which are frequently made of
              | copper. Consequently, the dangers of contamination from Cu-Cu bonds are no greater
              | than that of copper interconnects isolated by a thin tantalum barrier.

              | 
text          |        As discussed in Chapter 1, the very presence of copper in back-end metal layers
              | provides a convenient base for Cu-Cu bonding of aligned vertical interconnects.
              | Accordingly, most of the effort in optimizing copper bonding techniques has been
              | focused on wafer stacking (or chip-to-wafer) applications, including optimization of
              | through silicon vias (TSV) that would vertically connect device layers through Si bulk.

title         | 6.1 Introduction
blank         | 
text          |        A more recently developed attachment technique is that of titanium-based wafer
              | bonding [164]. It is similar to the copper-copper bonding approach in that it uses a
              | metallic intermediate, in this case titanium (Ti), to attach either full or patterned wafers
              | together. Similarly, the metal layer, which is used for mechanical attachment also
              | provides direct electrical and thermal interconnections. However, unlike Cu-Cu
              | technique, which requires metal on both mating surfaces, one could also achieve direct
              | Ti-Si and Ti-SiO2 bonding using the titanium-based approach, provided that surfaces
              | are sufficiently smooth. Finally, titanium-based wafer bonding is possible at low
              | temperatures (~400°C) [165], complying with back-end-of-line (BEOL) conditions
              | required for successful monolithic 3DIC fabrication.

              | exemplified by excellent adhesion properties with SiO2. In addition, titanium is an
              | effective gas scavenger, with the ability to dissolve up to 33 atom % of oxygen in a
              | solid solution at elevated temperatures [165]. Coupled with similar ability to absorb
              | nitrogen, titanium metallic layer could effectively reduce or eliminate interfacial gas
              | bubbles that may have formed or become trapped during the bonding procedure.
              | Finally, titanium has been widely used in Ti/TiN liners for Al metalization, making it
              | well characterized BEOL processing, CMOS-compatible material. Put together, these
              | exceedingly desirable properties make low-temperature titanium-based bonding quite
              | attractive for 3DICs.

blank         | 
text          |         The mechanism of bonding two surfaces with Ti metal on each is that of
              | interfacial atomic diffusion, just like the case of Cu-Cu bonding. In these thermo-
              | compressive techniques, heat and pressure are applied to aid metal atom migration
              | along and across the interface, thus forming a permanent bond between the two
              | surfaces. The self-diffusivity of Ti at 400 °C is 1.8 x 10-17 cm2/s [164] which is
              | reasonable compared to that of Cu at the same temperature (8.5 x 10-17 cm2/s [160]). A
              | quick estimate of Ti diffusion length during a typical bonding process of 2 hours at 400
              | °C would be (Dt)1/2 = 3.6 nm, which is in agreement with observed grain extrusion
              | across the interface (Fig. 6.1).

              | 
text          |         As with other techniques requiring interfacial diffusion of atoms, the surface
              | condition is critical to the success of the bond. Any particles, hydrocarbon
              | contaminations, surface oxidation or gas adsorption/entrapment could limit the kinetics
              | of the interfacial diffusion reaction, adversely affecting the strength of the bond. An
              | instructive example is that of Shimatsu et al. [166], where immediately after Ti
              | deposition in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber, successful Ti/Ti bonding was
              | performed in situ at room temperature and small bonding pressure (~2 kPa). Therefore,
              | if one substantially limits Ti surface degradation due to oxidation or contamination,
              | strong Ti-Ti bonds could be achieved at much lower temperatures than 400 °C.

text          |         The mechanism of Ti-Si bond formation, on the other hand is substantially
              | different. Solid-state amorphization at the Ti/Si interface plays a key role, where fast
              | diffusing Si atoms mix into Ti metal creating an amorphous titanium silicide at low
              | temperatures. Both the rate of Si diffusion in Ti (3.0 x 10-15 cm2/s at 400°C [160]), and
              | the necessary chemical driving force of negative heat of mixing (-39 kJ/g-atom [167])
              | ensure solid-state amorphization takes place, and the Ti-Si bond forms. Finally, the
              | mechanism of Ti-SiO2 bonding is that of reduction reaction at the interface, and is
              | explained in detail by Yu et al. [164].

text          |         To investigate whether Ti bonding is a feasible process for achieving 3DICs via

              | wafers using Ti-Ti bonding at 400°C. Similarly to the Cu-Cu process described earlier,
              | the donor wafer was subsequently split using SmartCut® technique, leaving behind an
              | array of crystal semiconductor islands. The schematic of the Ti/Ti bonding process is

text          |        The 4” wafers to be bonded were first cleaned in Piranha solution (H2O2:H2SO4
              | = 1:4) for 20 minutes, rinsed in DI water and dried prior to e-beam evaporation (or Ar
              | sputtering) of 40nm Ti layer on each mating surface. A 1x1 µm AFM scan showing the
              | resulting surface roughness of Ti layer deposited onto Si islands can be seen in Figure
              | 6.3. Right before the bonding step, the wafers were treated in HCl:H2O (1:1) for 30 sec,
              | rinsed, dried and immediately loaded into the EV501 bonder. The purpose of the
              | cleaning steps is to remove organic contaminants and the remaining native oxide in
              | order to improve the surface reaction kinetics. The mating wafer pair was bonded at 400
              | °C for 2 hours, with 3.3 kN of downward force over 4” diameter area (420 kPa) and
              | base pressure of ~1 x 10-4 Torr. However, due to the reduced contact area of patterned
              | islands, the effective applied pressure is closer to 1 MPa. After bonding, the donor
              | wafer was removed by hydrogen ion splitting (SmartCut®), which occurred after an
              | eight hour anneal at 400 °C in N2(g) for the H+ dose implanted (7 x 1016 cm-2, 90 keV).

text          |        There were no optically visible defects or voids present within the islands,

              | conditions across the wafer. This is partially due to the donor wafer being a perfectly

              | (0.69 nm rms) as illustrated on Figure 6.3. Together, smooth mating surfaces ensured
              | large effective contact area for thermo-compressive Ti-Ti bond to form by surface atom

text          |        The cause of incomplete transfer is surface roughness, which significantly limits
              | the area of contact for Ti-Ti bond to form. The titanium layer itself is not the cause,
              | since it is relatively smooth (0.69nm rms) and was successfully used to attach Si islands
              | (<0.2nm rms). However, the epitaxially grown germanium layer from which the donor
              | islands are patterned has significant surface roughness (>2 nm rms), which is inherent to
              | the growth method (Fig. 6.8). As described in Appendix B, lattice mismatched Ge
              | crystal is forced to relax on top of (100) Si using multiple hydrogen annealing steps,
              | which repair most of the crystal defects, but are unable to completely smoothen the

blank         | 
text          |        The adhesion of flat, polished surfaces goes back to 1936, when Lord Rayleigh
              | showed the presence of interaction energy between two glass plates [168].
              | Consequently, bonding of semiconductor wafers to glass was demonstrated, albeit with
              | large applied electric field at 500 °C [169]. This process is generally known as anodic
              | bonding. However, the true form of semiconductor wafer bonding is a process of
              | joining two mirror-polished wafers at room temperature without any special ‘glue’ or
              | external forces. Therefore, this rather elegant method of fusing wafers together has
              | found wide applications from fabrication of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates [77],
              | to production of 3D micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) [78]. In addition, it has
              | recently been used to produce first germanium-on-insulator (GeOI) substrates [83], as
              | well as early Ge-based monolithic 3DICs discussed in Chapter 1 [86].
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        In the case of monolithic 3DIC application, fusion bonding offers a viable and
              | clean method to attach crystalline semiconductor islands at low temperature. This ‘glue-
              | free’ approach would provide a new canvas of crystalline material in which upper layer
              | active devices could be fabricated. Given that the acceptor wafer surface would be
              | either patterned or flat dielectric layer (ILD) covering underlying circuits, most of the
              | research effort has been focused on SiO2-SiO2, Si-SiO2 and Ge-SiO2 as bonding
              | techniques for island attachment. The design simplicity, material compatibility, as well
              | as room-temperature processing are great advantages of fusion bonding. However, the
              | stringency of the surface smoothness requirement for successful attachment and the
              | resulting bond strength must be fully investigated to determine how suitable the method
              | is for monolithic 3DIC applications.

text          |        When two smooth surfaces are brought close to each other, they can fuse and
              | become quite difficult to separate. Different forces acting at the interface cause the
              | adhesion, while their relative strength is dependent on the separation distance. For short
              | distances between both surfaces (d ~ 1 nm) the dominant forces are hydrogen bonding
              | and van der Waals forces (due to instantaneous atomic dipole moments) [170]. Since
              | these forces act over very short ranges, it is crucial to start with very smooth wafers (of
              | low surface roughness) in order to achieve large-area contact and thus a strong bond.

text          |        Depending on the surface chemistry, two varieties of fusion bonding are
              | possible: hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Because the goal of monolithic 3DIC is to

              | hydrophilic, the choice was made to pursue hydrophilic fusion bonding. The details of

              | pairings, such as Si-SiO2, SiO2-SiO2 and even Ge-SiO2, are variants of this mechanism.

              | 
text          |        Once hydrophilic bonding at room temperature fuses the wafers, the bond
              | strength is quite weak: around 180 mJ/m2 [79]. Thermal annealing is required to
              | strengthen the bond. Up to 110 °C the surfaces are held together by hydrogen bonding
              | between multiple layers of water molecules (up to 1 nm thick), bridging the gap and
              | accommodating surface roughness. The only reaction occurring is a slow fracture effect
              | where Si–O–Si bonds (either native or thermal SiO2) are broken by adsorbed water
              | molecules to increase the number of –OH groups present.

              | 
text          | In the second phase up to 150 °C, the silanol groups connected by hydrogen bonding
              | polymerize across the interface to form much stronger covalent siloxane bonds (Si–O–
              | Si). The chemical reaction is reversible up to 425 °C [171], and expressed as:

blank         | 
text          | where Si(1) and Si(2) refer to silicon atoms on wafers (1) and (2) respectively. After a
              | sufficiently long anneal time, equilibrium of water concentrations between the interface
              | and the surrounding ambient develops. Consequently, by effectively removing the H2O
              | product of the forward reaction, one can increase the concentration of siloxane bonds.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        Since water desorption above 150 °C is irreversible, long anneal completes the
              | outgassing and almost all of the silanol groups are converted to siloxane bonds in the
              | contacted areas. Therefore, for temperatures below 800 °C, the contact area ultimately
              | limits the maximum bond strength achievable (~ 1.2 J/m2). In addition, inert gasses such
              | as nitrogen, N2 (g), can remain trapped in nanocavities formed by the surface roughness,
              | preventing further siloxane bonds between the wafers. Bonding in vacuum would
              | ameliorate such an issue.

text          |        Finally, annealing hydrophilic bonded wafers above 800 °C starts viscous oxide

title         | 7.3    Low-temperature hydrophilic bonding
blank         | 
text          |        Normally, fusion-bonded wafers are annealed at high temperatures (up to 1100
              | °C) to reach high bonding energy and void-free interface. However, the mechanism
              | described in the previous section suggests that hydrophilic bonding of SiO2-SiO2, Ge-
              | SiO2 and Si-SiO2 could be achieved at temperatures as low as 150 °C given sufficiently
              | long anneals. Therefore, in the case of monolithic 3DIC applications (< 400°C),
              | hydrophilic fusion bonding of perfectly flat surfaces could theoretically form strong
              | bonds (~ 1.6 J/m2 for Si-SiO2 and ~ 1 J/m2 for SiO2-SiO2) [79]. However, in practice,
              | only the silanol groups in close proximity are converted into siloxane bonds, making
              | surface roughness the critical factor limiting bond strength (by way of limiting effective
              | contact area). Viscous oxide flow at temperatures above 800°C is not an option for
              | 3DIC applications. Hence, to get stronger bonds one can either minimize surface
              | roughness, or increase the density of bonds in the areas that are in contact.

text          |        Bonding surfaces could be activated by plasma treatment [173] or by wet
              | chemical means. Oxygen (and nitrogen) plasma treatment prior to bonding has been
              | reported to lead to high bonding energy at moderate temperatures [174]. The effect is
              | likely due to surface charging, increased roughness and SiO2 porosity, all of which
              | augment the number of available bonding sites [175]. However, plasma treatment may
              | potentially be unsuitable for activating fully processed wafers due to the antenna effect
              | [176]. In addition, significant particle contamination took place during plasma
              | processing at SNF, causing large interfacial voids to appear. Unable to resolve the
              | particle issue, wet chemical processing was pursued instead.

text          | Both native SiO2 and thermal SiO2 can be activated by wet chemical means. The basic
              | reaction is the breaking of surface siloxane bonds by water to form two silanol groups:

text          | This reaction is only valid if the siloxane bonds are strained, as in the native oxide,
              | where the 130° Si-O-Si bond angle deviates from the equilibrium value of 144°, making
              | it much more reactive. Fully hydrolysed silica surface has 4.6 OH groups/nm2.
              | Compared to the native oxide, the less-strained thermal-oxide siloxane bonds have only
              | 0.06 OH groups/nm2 (Fig. 7.2), and would require very long times (60h+) in boiling
              | H2O to become fully hydrolysed [79].

text          |        Consequently, it is crucial to use a solution containing H+ or OH- groups to
              | activate the surface by increasing the density of the silanol groups. Since density of
              | silanol (–OH) groups is directly correlated to the bond strength [177], surface activation
              | should yield stronger bonds compared to control. The contact angle of water could be
              | used to determine the degree of activation, since water molecules readily form hydrogen
              | bonds with surface silanol groups. Thus, a highly activated surface would be wetting (or
              | hydrophilic), producing low contact angles. Figure 7.3 presents water contact angles on
              | Si surfaces subjected to standard semiconductor processing chemical solutions.

text          |        Hydrophilic fusion bonding has been investigated in following configurations:
              | Si-SiO2, SiO2-SiO2 and Ge-SiO2. Moreover, in addition to full 4-inch wafer bonding,
              | fusion bonding of patterned islands was performed.

text          |        The wafers to be bonded were first checked to ensure surfaces were smooth
              | enough to bond (< 0.5 nm RMS). If not, appropriate polishing and post-CMP cleaning
              | steps were taken to remove roughness (see Appendix A). Subsequently, mating surfaces
              | were activated in NH4OH:H2O2:H2O (1:1:5) at 80 °C for 10 minutes, followed by DI
              | water rinse and spin dry. In the case of germanium activation, the activation solution did
              | not contain H2O2 (since it etches Ge). The wafers were manually bonded in a Teflon jig
              | by roughly aligning the flats and pressing them together face-to-face. At this point, infra
              | red (IR) camera was sometimes used to determine if any voids were present at the
              | interface. The bonded pair was subsequently annealed to strengthen the bond at various
              | temperatures and durations (typically 200 °C for 48 hours followed by 400 °C for 12
              | hours). Finally, donor wafers that had H+ implanted (7 x 1016 cm-2, 90 keV) were
              | removed by hydrogen ion splitting (SmartCut®). Section 4.7 offers more details of the
              | hydrogen exfoliation process.

              | bonding process described above bonded well. They attached to each other immediately
              | upon pressing them together, and remained intact after various thermal anneals. To
              | determine the quality of the fusion bond, the mating interface was imaged using IR
              | camera while the bond strength was measured by crack opening method [182].

              | 
text          | During hydrophilic fusion bonding, interfacial voids may form and limit the area of
              | successful attachment. Such voids are caused by either micro-particle contamination or
              | outgassing during thermal annealing. This is of serious concern since a 1 µm-sized
              | particle could produce a void approximately 5 mm in diameter [79]. Careful handling
              | while bonding and a cleanroom environment (class 1000 or better) can minimize the
              | occurrence of micro-particle induced voids. Thus, void-free interfaces can be achieved
              | as exhibited in IR images of wafer pairs immediately after bonding - Figure 7.8 (no
              | anneal).

              | fewer thermally induced voids than the Si-Si pair, while the island wafers produced no
              |                                        voids at all.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        The second cause of voids is thermal annealing. The thermally induced voids are
              | actually caused by accumulation of gas molecules (e.g. H2, H2O or NH3) trapped at the
              | interface. Gas is generated as either desorbed hydrocarbons or as by-products of the
              | interfacial polymerization reaction, which forms the hydrophilic fusion bond (see
              | Section 7.2). In the case of NH4OH-activated Si, SiO2, or Ge surfaces practiced in this
              | chapter, the bulky tetrahedral NH3 gas molecules diffuse out very slowly along the
              | interface, especially at low temperatures. Thus, they can become trapped, limiting the
              | contact area and preventing the formation of more siloxane bonds. Since they cannot
              | diffuse into Si, they cause many voids at Si-Si interface at 225 °C and 450 °C (Fig. 7.8).

text          | Similar observations by Mitani et al. [183] found that these bubble defects mainly form
              | after annealing below 900 °C. Alternatively, very high temperature anneals (>1000 °C)
              | can eliminate Si-Si voids by speeding up the out-diffusion process (not pictured).

              | 
text          |        In the case of Si-SiO2 bonding, ammonia (NH3) can diffuse into the silicon
              | dioxide layer, thus suppressing thermal void formation at low-temperatures (Fig. 7.1).
              | This is especially the case for porous PECVD SiO2 [179], where the volumetric fraction
              | of void space, or porosity, could be as high as 41% [184]. Consequently, SiO2-SiO2
              | hydrophilic bonding having two oxide surfaces is even less prone to thermally induced
              | voids, as depicted in Figure 7.9a, where only a couple of voids are visible in the SiO2-

text          |          Such high transfer yields could be attributed to the use of islands in fusion
              | bonding. Because any one island is not larger than 2000 µm, the interfacial gas
              | molecules have less than 1000 µm to diffuse to the channels left between the islands.
              | Comparing to the full 4-inch wafer bonding case, gaseous by-products need to travel up
              | to 50,000 µm (50 mm) along the interface to escape into ambient (a factor of 50
              | longer). Therefore, bonding islands significantly reduces the diffusion length and thus
              | time needed to outgas during low-temperature anneals. Together with the use of
              | ‘porous’ PECVD SiO2 [179,184] (not implemented here), island structures could
              | effectively suppress the occurrence of thermally induced voids upon annealing (Fig.

text          |        Bond strength is equivalent to the value of bonding energy, since it can be
              | thought of as the amount of work required (in Joules) to separate the bonded wafers, per

blank         | 
text          |        Fusion bonding does provide an elegant method to attach single-crystal silicon
              | and germanium islands onto amorphous substrates without requiring intermediate
              | materials to achieve bonding. However, this process simplicity is counterbalanced by
              | stringent surface smoothness requirement that could be satisfied by CMP, or alleviated
              | by chemical surface activation. The resulting hydrophilic Si-SiO2, SiO2-SiO2 and Ge-
              | SiO2 bonds are weaker than thermo-compressive bonds, such as Cu-Cu or AlGe eutectic
              | bonds. However, with chemical surface activation and 3DIC compatible annealing,
              | fusion bonding is strong enough to endure further processing, including SmartCut® and
              | CMP. Finally, the use of island structures has been found to significantly reduce the
              | occurrence of thermally induced voids, while also increasing the bond strength.
              | Therefore, due to aforementioned reasons, hydrophilic fusion bonding offers an
              | attractive method to achieve low-temperature 3DICs via crystal island attachment.

text          |        Three-dimensional (3D) integration of semiconductor devices offers the
              | advantages of denser circuits, lower power consumption and greater speed over
              | conventional (2D) integrated-circuit technology in which all transistors are fabricated in
              | one plane. In order to reap these benefits, it is critical to have high vertical interconnect
              | density between layers, a requirement that is best met by monolithic integration.
              | However, because monolithic 3DIC approach involves sequential fabrication of circuits
              | over pre-existing layers, stringent temperature limits are imposed on upper layer

text          |        This thesis addressed the fundamental challenge of obtaining single-crystal,
              | device-quality semiconductor islands for fabrication of upper layer circuits of a
              | monolithic 3DIC. We have shown that seedless laser crystallization of silicon could
              | form high quality, oriented crystals on amorphous templates by graphoepitaxy, but at
              | process temperatures incompatible with 3DIC applications. A more straightforward
              | approach of attaching high-quality crystalline islands for upper-layer devices was
              | successfully demonstrated using a variety of low-temperature bonding methods in
              | combination with SmartCut® and CMP.

text          |        Feasibility of using transient laser annealing for monolithic 3DIC fabrication
              | was evaluated using one-dimensional thermal diffusion model. We found that single 15
              | µs pulse could melt and recrystallize thin α-Si layers on top of 5 µm of thermally
              | insulating SiO2, while maintaining the underlying circuit layers below 450 °C. Thus,
              | we constructed experimental apparatus consisting of 10W cw Nd:YAG laser operating
              | at 532 nm wavelength, acousto-optic modulator allowing for µs pulse lengths, as well as
              | illumination and imaging systems.

text          |        Graphoepitaxy via transient laser annealing of both silicon and germanium was
              | explored as a method to achieve oriented high-quality crystal islands on amorphous
              | substrates. In an effort to impart superior orientation control, novel nano-grating
              | templates of 190 nm pitch were fashioned in amorphous SiO2 using nanoimprint
              | lithography (NIL). However, results of experiments using pulsed cw, scanned cw as
              | well as excimer laser anneals produced randomly oriented grains 30 nm to several
              | microns in size, with no preferential crystal orientation. Two-dimensional (2D) relief
              | pattern of inverted pyramids, on the other hand, demonstrated high degree of in-plane
              | <001> as well as out-of-plane <100> Si crystal orientation matching the underlying
              | template exactly. Moreover, we found grains up to 500 nm in size to be virtually defect-
              | free. However, closer examination of the thermal profiles during laser annealing
              | revealed significant heating of the substrate, which facilitated the growth of large and
              | preferentially oriented crystals by limiting undercooling, but at the same time made the
              | process 3DIC incompatible.

              | 
text          |        To gain better understanding of the crystallization process, we developed a
              | simulation algorithm that models the homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation and
              | grain-growth phenomena in laser-melted semiconductor films. We found that inherently
              | large thermal gradients develop between laser-melted semiconductor liquid (>937°C)
              | and the underlying substrate (<400°C), causing very fast cooling rates, on the order of
              | 300 °C/µs. Consequently, the quickly undercooled liquid triggers uncontrolled
              | spontaneous nucleation that limits both the size and quality of resulting grains. The
              | validity of the simulation was supported with the experimental results of rapid melt
              | growth (RMG) of Ge from attached Si (100) seeds. Ultimately, it became clear that
              | successful graphoepitaxy requires significant substrate heating that is unacceptable for
              | 3DIC applications.

text          |        Finally, a full 3DIC-compatible process to transfer bulk-quality crystalline Si

              | hydrogen ion-induced exfoliation (SmartCut®) to remove the bulk of the donor wafer,
              | while the splitting damage is polished away with touch-CMP technique. Finally, planar

text          |        The FPGA is an inherently interconnect-limited technology with three distinct
              | and easily separable functions – logic blocks, connection blocks and switching blocks
              | (Fig. 8.1). Splitting the three functions vertically, heterogeneous integration would
              | create a 3D-FPGA. Re-implementation of a baseline 2-dimensional Xilinx Virtex II
              | FPGA (65nm technology) as a 3D circuit was calculated to offer numerous advantages:

text          |        Realization of fully functional monolithic 3DIC circuits such as 3D-FPGA is
              | certainly a promising path towards demonstrating the wide-reaching gains of vertical
              | integration. However, there are many other areas that merit further research.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        In the case of laser crystallization and graphoepitaxy, even if only small (30-50
              | nm) sized islands are achievable, they can still be used for device fabrication. Given that
              | new generations of devices have very small (<32nm) critical dimensions, one could
              | conceivably fabricate one device per grain, provided that the channel region is defect
              | free. For example, a method that could pre-determine the location of grain boundaries
              | (such as surface nano-asperities in Chapter 2) would open the door for possible high
              | performance devices in laser-induced microcrystalline islands.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        Furthermore, in the area of bonding, the full potential of sub-eutectic AlGe
              | bonding capabilities could be investigated further. In particular, the technique seems to
              | maintain many of its advantages well below eutectic temperature, as it becomes more
              | thermo-compressive in nature. Given the high mobility of inter-diffusing Al and Ge
              | atoms in solid phase, sub-eutectic AlGe bonding may become the preferred low-
              | temperature attachment technique. Overall, one cannot be unimpressed by the sheer
              | versatility of the different low-temperature bonding methods. The plethora of material
              | choices, thicknesses, adhesion strengths, sealing properties, electrical connections, as
              | well as temperature requirements provides a well-stocked bonding toolbox that could
              | effectively solve many heterogeneous integration challenges. The ability to place and
              | attach islands of any material onto almost any surface at low-temperature brings the
              | science of bonding out of the packaging realm and into the forefront of heterogeneous
              | microstructure engineering.

text          |        The use of chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is indispensable in the context

              | bumpy topography on the wafer. In order to successfully integrate multiple layers,

text          |        Initially, conformal LPCVD low temperature silicon dioxide was deposited
              | directly over the attached crystal islands. The excess SiO2 was polished away by CMP
              | using Ultra-Sol S10 slurry (Fig. A.5a). However, because the slurry is formulated for
              | polysilicon polishing, with approximate selectivity between Si:SiO2 of 3:1, it
              | preferentially removed Si islands causing severe dishing (Fig. A.5b).

text          |        In order to prevent dishing, an extra layer of silicon nitride (SiN) is introduced
              | underneath the SiO2 as a polish stop. As a test, 40 nm of low-stress LPCVD SiNx was
              | deposited at 870 °C, even though low temperature alternatives, such as PECVD SiN
              | could be deposited at 350 °C or below [193]. In the case of Ultra-Sol S10 slurry used,
              | the ratio of removal rates between SiO2 and SiNx was measured to be 4:1. Therefore,
              | with the polish stop in place, the CMP of deposited dielectric SiO2 halted upon reaching
              | the silicon nitride layer. The resulting planarization of the dissimilar materials is

              | 
              | 
text          |        Germanium, as noted before, has superior semiconductor properties to silicon,
              | which make it an attractive choice for upper layer active devices of a 3DIC. However,
              | to harness the advantage of high mobility electrons and holes, defect free germanium
              | crystal material is required. Traditionally, Czochralski grown Ge bulk wafers, such as
              | those supplied by Umicore®, provide perfect Ge crystal lattice ideal for device
              | fabrication. However, due to their prohibitive cost, Ge bulk wafers have been replaced
              | with relaxed epitaxial germanium layers grown on Si (100) substrates. The 4% lattice
              | constant mismatch between Si and Ge must be absorbed either through a SiGe buffer
              | layer [195], or by relaxing the epitaxial layer through multiple hydrogen anneals [196].
              | Following the MHAH method by Nayfeh et al. [197], a thick (~1.5 µm) epitaxial Ge
              | layer is fabricated on Si substrate with final defect density of less than 106 /cm2 and
              | surface roughness under 1.6 nm RMS. This technique has been used in this work.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        Another significant advantage of using epi-Ge layer on Si bulk wafer is that the
              | thick Si wafer dominates the thermal expansion coefficient. Because the acceptor wafer
              | is also made of silicon, the coefficients are matched, simplifying the bonding process.
              | Specifically, there is less chance of bond failure or structural defects arising during
              | annealing due to stresses caused by material mismatch, as is the case when bonding
              | bulk Ge to bulk Si wafers.

              | (106 cm-2) could be transferred onto an acceptor wafer (via bonding and SmartCut®),
              | thus paving the way toward building Ge devices on upper layers of monolithic 3DICs.

              |   Note: relief of the epi-Ge layer in the SEM is due to cleaving process and not due to

text          |        It is important to note that a longer, 5 layer epi-Ge recipe could grow thicker
              | films with smoother surfaces, due to the compounding affect of multiple hydrogen
              | anneals. However, the ultimate Ge surface smoothness achieved via MHAH method is
              | about 1.5 nm RMS, as shown in Fig. B.3.

text          |        As grown epitaxial Ge surfaces are therefore too rough for successful low
