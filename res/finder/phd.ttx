text          | This thesis contributes to understanding the economics of mergers and acquisitions.
              | It provides new empirical techniques to study these processes, based on structural,
              | game theoretical models. In particular, it makes two main contributions. In Chapter
              | 2, I study the issues arising when mergers take place in a two-sided market. In such
              | markets, firms face two interrelated demand curves, which complicates the decision
              | making process and makes standard merger models inapplicable. In Chapter 3, I
              | provide a general framework to identify cost synergies from mergers without using
              | cost data. The estimator is based on a dynamic model with endogenous mergers and
              | product repositioning. Both chapters contain an abstract model that can be tailored
              | to many markets, as well as a specific application to the merger wave in the U.S.
              | radio industry.

text          | I would like to thank my advisers Lanier Benkard and Peter Reiss for their guidance
              | over the years, their patience and their constant feedback that helped me to consider-
              | ably improve my work. Moreover, I would like to express my gratitude to numerous
              | people I encountered who believed in me and supported me along my path to this
              | degree. In particular, this thesis would have been impossible without my adviser
              | Tomasz Szapiro at the Warsaw School of Economics. He motivated me and directly
              | helped me to make my adventure in the United States possible. My interest in game
              | theory and dynamic models was triggered by great conversations with my adviser
              | Rabah Amir at the University of Arizona. I would like to thank him for his support
              | and help while applying to Stanford GSB. Last but not least, I am grateful to all the
              | community at Stanford University – professors, fellow students and casual friends –
              | for creating a unique environment for my intellectual and personal development.

text          | A horizontal merger occurs when two or more competing companies combine to jointly
              | operate. Both the European Commission (2004) and the U.S. Department of Justice
              | (1997) recognize that such mergers may lessen competition and thereby harm con-
              | sumers. Therefore, in order to prevent anti-competitive conduct, both bodies employ
              | a set of analytical tools that predict and analyze the consequences of mergers. The
              | dominant paradigm from the 1950s and through the 1970s was the structure-conduct-
              | performance approach (see Bain (1968)). It assumes that market power is directly
              | related to market concentration, and proposes using concentration indexes (e.g. the
              | Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) for merger enforcement. This approach however, does
              | not explicitly explain the conduct of firms and ignores many important issues, for
              | example product differentiation, and heterogeneity of consumers or cost synergies.
              | In contrast, modern industrial organization has developed new techniques, based on
              | game theory, that endogenize the behavior of companies and allow for more detailed
              | and robust evaluation of mergers.
              |    Current analysis of horizontal mergers in markets with differentiated products is
              | based on a static supply and demand approach (e.g. Nevo (2000)). It is usually
              | done in two steps. In the first step, one estimates a flexible demand system (e.g.
              | Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), Ackerberg and Rysman (2005), Berry (1994), Berry,
              | Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995)) and supply system. The demand system is a function of
              | product characteristics, prices and heterogeneous consumer preferences. The supply

text          | system is determined by the equilibrium behavior of firms that maximize their profits.
              | In the second step, one exogenously imposes a hypothetical merger and solves for the
              | post-merger equilibrium using the estimates from the first step. The new equilibrium
              | provides predictions about post-merger prices and quantities that can be used to
              | identify the short-run impact of the merger on consumer and producer surplus. This
              | thesis provides two extensions to this framework. First, it develops a new supply and
              | demand system that encompasses the merger analysis of two-sided markets. Second,
              | it proposes a dynamic framework in which mergers and product repositioning are
              | endogenous. It allows for long-run predictions, including evaluation of possible fixed
              | cost synergies of mergers. These methods are applied to analyze the 1996-2006 merger
              | wave in the U.S. radio industry.
              |    In the chapter 2 of this thesis, I focus on how mergers affect two-sided markets. In a
              | two-sided market, firms provide services to two types of consumers and facilitate their
              | interaction via a platform. This creates cross-consumer externalities; thus, the profits
              | of a firm operating a platform depend on sales to both types of consumers. Examples
              | of such markets include the following: radio, in which stations sell ads and provide
              | programming to listeners; credit cards, in which firms connect merchants and credit
              | card holders; operating systems, in which revenue comes from hardware buyers and
              | application developers. Antitrust analysis in these markets is complicated and it must
              | take into account the market specific economic features (Armstrong (2006), Rochet
              | and Tirole (2006), Evans (2002)). In particular, in the case of a merger, a firm has
              | incentives to exercise market power on both sides of the market. These incentives are
              | often conflicting. For example, in the radio market, stations sell advertising knowing
              | it negatively impacts their listenership. On the one hand, a merged firm might sell
              | more advertising in order to exercise market power on listeners. On the other hand, it
              | might sell less advertising in order to exercise market power on advertisers. Chapter 2
              | investigates this conflict by estimating a model of supply and demand for advertising
              | and radio programming. Using this model, it performs counterfactual experiments
              | that predict the post-merger advertising quantity supplied and the new division of
              | surplus between listeners and advertisers. I find that mergers decrease the amount of
              | advertising supplied, thereby increasing listener welfare by 1%. However, at the same
header        | CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION                                                                 3

text          | time the decrease in ad supply raises prices and lowers advertiser welfare by $300m
              | per year.
              |    A static analysis does not recognize that firms may adjust their product portfolio
              | after a merger. In theory, mergers could increase or decrease product variety. On
              | the one hand, they can increase the variety because a merged firm wants to avoid
              | cannibalization. On the other hand, the firm might crowd products together to
              | prevent entry. In the former case, if consumers prefer more variety, it is possible that
              | repositioning could alleviate the negative effects of the merger (Berry and Waldfogel
              | (2001), Sweeting (2008)). Chapter 2 provides a method to disaggregate the total
              | impact of the merger on consumer surplus into changes in product variety and in
              | supplied quantity. The same method can be used to predict whether extra variety
              | could alleviate negative market power effects for a hypothetical merger. In the case
              | of radio, extra variety alone leads to a 1.3% increase in listener welfare and decreases
              | advertiser welfare by $147m per year. I find that product ownership consolidation
              | and repositioning are followed by advertising quantity readjustments. I estimate that
              | this effect alone leads to a 0.3% decrease in listener welfare (with the variety effect it
              | sums to a 1% increase) and an additional $153m decrease in advertiser welfare (with
              | the variety effect it totals $300m). While extra variety mitigates the negative effects
              | of mergers on listeners, it increases the negative impact on advertisers.
              |    Chapter 3 deals with a dynamic merger analysis. The current empirical litera-
              | ture on mergers and repositioning assumes that the market structure is exogenous
              | (Nevo (2000), Pinkse and Slade (2004), Ivaldi and Verboven (2005)). This approach
              | does not take into account dynamic processes like post-merger repositioning, follow-
              | up mergers, and fixed cost synergies, that could potentially lower prices and provide
              | consumers with other non-price benefits. Moreover, the assumption that mergers are
              | exogenous may create a selection bias that results in overestimation of cost synergies
              | (for example the estimator might pick up other unobserved components correlated
              | with the propensity to merge). This thesis provides a new, dynamic framework in
              | which decisions to merge and to reposition products are endogenous. Such an ap-
              | proach provides consistent estimates of the long-run effects of mergers. In addition, it
              | allows for the estimation of cost synergies without any data on cost. The framework

text          | is straightforward, easy to implement, and computationally tractable. Application to
              | radio reveals that the 1996-2006 merger wave provided $2.5b per year of cost syn-
              | ergies, which constitutes about 10% of total industry revenue. The scale of those
              | efficiencies is a an order of magnitude higher than loss in surplus for advertisers.

heading       | 2.1      Preface
text          | This chapter studies the consequences of mergers in two-sided markets by estimating a
              | structural supply and demand model and performing counterfactual experiments. The
              | analysis is performed on the example of a merger wave in U.S. radio; however, it is applicable
              | to other two-sided markets like credit cards, trading platforms or computer games. There
              | are two main contributions from this chapter. First, I identify the conflicting incentives of
              | merged firms to exercise market power on both sides of the market (listeners and advertisers
              | in the case of radio). Second, I disaggregate the effect of mergers on consumers into changes
              | in product variety and changes in supplied ad quantity.
              |    The model is estimated using data on 13,000 radio stations from 1996 to 2006. I find that
              | firms have moderate market power over listeners in all markets, extensive market power over
              | advertisers in small markets and no market power over advertisers in large markets. Coun-
              | terfactuals reveal that extra product variety created by post-merger repositioning increased
              | listeners’ welfare by 1.3% and decreased advertisers’ welfare by about $160m per-year. How-
              | ever, subsequent changes in supplied ad quantity decreased listener welfare by 0.4% (for a
              | total impact of +0.9%) and advertiser welfare by an additional $140m (for a total impact
              | of -$300m).

heading       | 2.2     Introduction
text          | Between 1996 and 2006, the U.S. radio industry experienced an unprecedented merger
              | wave due to the 1996 Telecommucation Act, which raised ownership caps in local
              | markets and abolished cross-market ownership restrictions. At the height of merger
              | activity, about 30% of stations changed ownership each year and about 20% changed
              | the format of broadcasted programming. In this paper, I use this merger wave to
              | study the consequences of consolidation in two-sided markets. I make two main
              | contributions. First, I identify conflicting incentives for stations to exercise market
              | power on both sides of the market (in the case of radio, the two sides are advertisers
              | and listeners). In particular, I separate the impact of consolidation on listener and
              | advertiser surplus. Second, I decompose this impact into effects of changes on product
              | variety and market power. As a result, I ask whether extra variety can mitigate the
              | negative effects of a decrease in competition. Similar issues arise in other two-sided
              | markets such as credit cards, newspapers or computer hardware. The framework
              | proposed in this paper can be easily adjusted to analyze any of these industries.
              |    In two-sided markets, firms face two interrelated demand curves from two distinct
              | types of consumers. These demands give merging firms conflicting incentives because
              | exercising market power in one market lowers profits in the other market. In the case
              | of radio, a company provides free programming to listeners but draws revenue from
              | selling advertising that is priced on a per-listener basis. In the listener market, a
              | merged firm would like to increase post-merger advertising because it captures some
              | switching listeners. This advertising decreases the welfare of listeners and increases
              | the welfare of advertisers. However, from the perspective of the advertising market,
              | the merged firm would like to supply less advertising, which has the exact opposite
              | impact on listener and advertiser welfare. The firm’s ultimate decision, which deter-
              | mines the impact of consolidation on the welfare of both consumer groups, depends
              | on the relative demand elasticities in both markets.
              |    In this paper, I separately estimate elasticities for both consumer groups using a
              | structural model of the demand and supply of radio programming and advertising.
              | Using those estimates, I perform counterfactual policy experiments that quantify the

text          | impact of consolidation on listener and advertiser surplus. I find that market power
              | on the listener side is similar across geographical markets. In contrast, the amount
              | of market power on the advertiser side depends on market population. In particular,
              | firms have a considerable control over advertising price in smaller markets; however,
              | they are price takers in larger markets. Consequently, mergers result in firms lowering
              | advertising quantity in small markets (less than 500 thousand people) by about 13%,
              | which leads to a 6% per-listener increase in ad prices. Mergers increase listener
              | surplus by 2.5% but at the same time decrease advertiser surplus by $235m per
              | year. Conversely, in large markets (more than 2 million people) mergers lead to
              | a 5.5% increase in total advertising minutes while per-listener price stays constant.
              | This results in a 0.3% decrease in listener welfare as well as a slight decrease in
              | advertiser welfare ($0.1m per year). The aggregate national impact of the merger
              | wave amounted to a listener welfare gain of 1% and a $300m per year advertiser
              | welfare loss. I conclude that listeners benefited and advertisers were disadvantaged
              | by the 1996 Telecom Act.
              |    My work is related to several theoretical papers studying complexity of pricing
              | strategies in two-sided markets. The closest studies related to this paper are: Arm-
              | strong (2006), Rochet and Tirole (2006), Evans (2002) and Dukes (2004). The general
              | conclusion in this literature is that using a standard supply and demand framework
              | of single-sided markets might be not sufficient to capture the economics of two-sided
              | markets. Additionally, there have been several empirical studies on this topic. For
              | example Kaiser and Wright (2006), Argentesi and Filistrucchi (2007) and Chandra
              | and Collard-Wexler (2009) develop empirical models that recognize the possibility of
              | market power in both sides of the market. They use a form of the Hotelling model pro-
              | posed by Armstrong (2006) to deal with product heterogeneity. I build on their work,
              | incorporating recent advances in the literature on demand with differentiated prod-
              | ucts. This allows me to incorporate richer consumer heterogeneity and substitution
              | patterns (e.g. Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995), and Nevo (2000)) that are neces-
              | sary to capture complicated consumer preferences for radio programing. Moreover, I
              | supplement reduced form results on market power with out-of-sample counterfactuals
              | that explicitly predict changes in supplied ad quantity and consumer welfare.

text          |       The second contribution of this paper is the decomposition of the total impact of
              | mergers on consumer surplus into changes in product variety and effects of exercising
              | extra market power from joint ownership. This exercise is motivated by the fact
              | that in most cases consumers have preference for variety, so it is possible that extra
              | variety created by mergers might mitigate the negative effects of extra market power.
              | In order to verify the above claim, I quantify consumers’ value for extra variety and
              | compare it to the loss in surplus coming from the extra market power. This approach
              | relates to Kim, Allenby, and Rossi (2002), who compute the compensating variation
              | for the changes of variety in tastes of yogurt and Brynjolfsson, Hu, and Smith (2003)
              | who do the same for the variety of books offered in on-line bookstores. These papers
              | assume away the fact that changes in variety will be followed by readjustments in
              | equilibrium prices. In this paper, taking their analysis one step forward, I incorporate
              | such strategic responses by performing counterfactual experiments.
              |       Berry and Waldfogel (2001) and Sweeting (2008) document that the post-1996
              | merger wave resulted in an increase in product variety. I investigate their claim using
              | a structural utility model and conclude that extra variety alone leads to a $1.3%
              | increase in listener welfare. However, because product repositioning softened com-
              | petition in the advertising market and caused some stations to switch to a “Dark“
              | format 1 , advertiser welfare decreased by $147m per year. Additionally, I find that
              | product ownership consolidation and repositioning are followed by advertising quan-
              | tity readjustments. I estimate, that effect alone leads to a 0.3% decrease in listener
              | welfare (with the variety effect it totals to the 1% increase) and an additional $153m
              | decrease in advertiser welfare (with the variety effect it totals $300m). While ex-
              | tra variety mitigates the negative effects of mergers on listeners, it strengthens the
              | negative impact on advertisers.
              |       This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the questions investigated
              | in the paper in a formal way and describes the structural model of the industry.
              | Section 3 contains the description of the data. Estimation techniques used to identify
              | the parameters of the model are described in Section 4. Results of the structural

heading       | 2.3     Radio as a two-sided market
text          | The radio industry is an example of a two-sided market (other examples include
              | advertising platforms, credit cards or video games). Such markets are usually char-
              | acterized by the existence of three types of agents: two types of consumers and
              | a platform provider. What distinguishes this setup from a standard differentiated
              | product oligopoly is that the platform provider is unable to set prices for each type of
              | consumer separately. Instead, the demand curves are interrelated through a feedback
              | loop in such a way that quantity sold to one consumer determines the market clearing
              | price for the other consumer. In this subsection I argue that this feedback makes it
              | complicated to determine whether the supplied quantities are strategic substitutes
              | or complements (as defined in Bulow, Geanakoplos, and Klemperer (1985)). This

              |    In the case of radio there are three types of agents: radio stations, listeners,
              | and advertisers. Radio stations provide free programming for listeners and draw
              | revenue from selling advertising slots. First, consider the demand curve for radio
              | programming. The listener market share of the radio station j is given by

text          | The important fact is that this condition shares features with both the Cournot and

              | quantity on price, and it is reminiscent of the standard quantity setting equilibrium

              | relative strengths of the direct effects and the feedback loop, we cannot conclude
              | whether a merger leads to an increase or decrease in ad quantity on the margin.
              | Moreover, in the borderline case in which the effects cancel each other, a merger does
              | not effect quantity at all; in this case, even though companies have market power
              | over both consumers, they are unable to exercise it. Measuring these effects is critical
              | for predicting the split of surplus between advertisers and listeners. When the direct
              | effect is stronger, mergers lead to contraction in the ad quantity supplied and higher
              | prices. This will benefit listeners but hurt advertisers. However, if the feedback loop
              | is stronger than the direct effect then merger leads to more advertising and lower
              | prices, benefiting advertisers and hurting listeners.
              |    Because the theory does not give a clear prediction about the split of surplus, I
              | investigate this question empirically using a structural model. In the remainder of

              | do not contain radio station level advertising prices. Instead, I make additional
              | assumptions that will enable me to compute the weights using publicly available data.
              | The reminder of this subsection discusses the formula for the weights and provides
              | an example supporting this intuition. The formal micro-model is given in Appendix
              | A.1.
              |      Let there be A types of advertisers. Each type a ∈ A targets a certain demographic
              | group(s) a. I.e. advertiser of type a gets positive utility only if a listener of type a
              | hears an ad. Denote rf |a to be the probability that a listener of type a chooses format
              | f and ra|f to be the probability that a random listener of format f is of type a.
              | Advertisers take these numbers, along with station ratings rj , as given and decide on
              | which station to advertise. This assumption is is motivated by the fact that about
              | 75% is purchased by small local firms. Such firms’ advertising decisions are unlikely
              | to influence prices and station ratings in the short run.

text          | The formal justification and derivation of this equation is given in Appendix A.1. The
              | intuition behind it is that the total impact on the per-listener price of an ad in format
              | f is a weighted average of impacts on the per-listener value of an ad for different types
              | of advertisers. The weighting is done by the advertisers’ arrival rates, which are equal
              | to the listeners’ arrival rates ra|f . For each advertiser of type a the change of value
              | of an ad in format f , in response to a change of total quantity supplied in format f 0 ,
              | is affected by two things: it is proportional to the probability of correct targeting in
              | format f , given by ra|f , because advertisers are expected utility maximizers; and it
              | is proportional to the share of advertising purchased by this advertiser in format f 0 ,
              | given by rf 0 |a . Assembling these pieces together and normalizing the weights to sum

text          |    In Table 2.1, the impact of Hits on the price of Talk is greater than the impact of
              | Talk on the price of Hits. This is due to the fact that the quantity supplied in the Hits
              | format affects Adult-targeting advertisers (who drive the price of the Talk format)
              | to a much greater extent than ad quantity in Talk affects Teen-targeting advertisers
              | (who drive the price of the Hits format). Moreover, because the weights sum up to
              | 1, it must be that the own effect of Talk is weaker than that of Hits. This is exactly

text          | I have constructed a panel of data on radio stations and radio station ownership
              | merging data from two sources: BIA Financial Network Inc. and the SQAD Media
              | Market Guide.
              |    BIAfn provided me data on: radio station ownership, revenues, market shares and
              | formats. The data are a 1996-2006 panel covering each radio station in the market
              | in 2006. The data are incomplete in the sense that I do not observe all the stations
              | that exited the market between 1996 and 2006. According to Sweeting (2007) there
              | were only 50 stations that exited during this period, mostly due to violations of FCC
              | regulations. Because this number is small relative to the 11,000 stations in the sample,
              | this omission is unlikely to significantly influence the results.
              |    The BIAfn data are supplemented with data on aggregate advertising prices. Un-
              | fortunately, price data at the station level are not available. SQAD instead provides
              | estimates of market prices that are obtained using proprietary formulas. According
              | to anecdotal evidence, those estimates are widely recognized as the industry standard
              | and are the best available data on market prices. Radio market prices are reported
              | as a Cost per Rating Point (CPP). CPP is the cost of advertising per 1 percent of
              | listenership. SQAD provides CPP broken down into daytime and demographic cat-
              | egories. We will estimate station level prices from SQAD CPPs using radio station
              | ratings that are broken down by time of day and demographics.
              |    An observation in my data is a radio station operating in a specific half-year and
              | in a specific market. BIAfn and SQAD use Arbitron market definitions. An Arbitron
              | market is in most cases a county or a metropolitan area. According to the surveys
              | conducted by CRA International (2007) for the Canadian market (which is similar to
              | the US market): “The majority of radio advertisers are local. They are only interested
              | in advertising in their local area since most of their customers and potential buyers
              | live in or very near their city.” In our analysis, I assume no interdependence between
              | markets. To further assure that there is no overlap between markets, I use only the
              | 88 market sub-selection that was developed in Sweeting (2007). Table 2.7 presents a
              | list of the 88 markets, along with their populations.

              | different age/gender groups within each station format between 1998 and 2006, and
              | shares for income, race and education groups between 2003 and 2006. Unfortunately,

              | The average number of stations owned in our dataset grew from 4.43 in 1996 to
              | 6.28 in 2006. This ownership consolidation resulted in growth of the market share
              | of the 3 biggest owners (C3) from 77% in 1996 to 90% in 2006, peaking at 97% in
              | 2000. The middle part of the table contains the average percentages of stations that
              | switched owners and that switched formats. Between 1996 and 2000 more than 10%
              | of stations switched owners yearly. After 2000 the number dropped to below 4%.
              | Greater concentration activity in the 1996-2000 period was also associated with more
              | format switching. The percentage of stations that switched format peaked in 1998
              | and 2001 at 13%.

text          | This stage provides the estimates of demand for radio programming θL . Estimation is
              | done using the generalized method of simulated moments. I use two sets of moment
              | conditions. The first set is based on the fact that innovation to station unobserved
              | quality ξj has a mean of zero conditional on the instruments:

math          |                                         E[ξjt − ρξjt−1 |Z1 , θL ] = 0                            (2.10)
blank         | 
text          | This moment condition follows Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) and extends it by
              | explicitly introducing auto-correlation of ξ. I use instruments for advertising quantity
              | since it is likely to be correlated with unobserved station quality. My instruments
              | include: lagged mean and second central moment of competitors’ advertising quantity,
              | lagged market HHIs and lagged number and cumulative market share of other stations
              | in the same format. These are valid instruments under the assumption that ξt follows
              | an AR(1) process and the fact that decisions about portfolio selection are made before
              | decisions about advertising.

              | the market (up to 500 people, between 500 and 1500, and 1500 or more). Ratings
              | and derivatives of ratings in the equation (2.14) are calculated using the estimates of
              | θL and ξ from the first stage. Demographic draws are taken from the CPS and are
              |                                                                       A

              | can back out θ1m by equating the observed average revenue in each market with its
              | predicted counterpart.
              |    Next I discuss a variation in the data that identifies parameters θA and θC . The
              | intuition for such identification is that estimating Equation 2.14 can be regarded as a
              |                             C
              | linear regression in which θm is an intercept and θ2A is a coefficient of a variable that
              | is a function of supplied quantity. In this case, the mean deviation of FOCs from zero
              |                                          C
              | in each market identifies the intercept θm . The slope parameter θ2A is identified by the
              | size of the response of the firm to changes in quantity supplied by its competitors due
              | to change in the market structure or demographics. Such a response, as mentioned
              | in Section 2.3, is composed of listeners’ demand feedback and the direct effect of
              | quantity on CPP. Elasticity of listeners’ demand, that determines the strength of the
              | feedback, is consistently estimated in the first step. Therefore, one can subtract the
              | difference out the feedback effect from the total response observed in the data. This
              | allows to obtain the strength of the direct effect that directly identifies the slope of
              | the CPP, θ2A . For example, if we look at the response of ad quantity reacting to the
              | merger, the slope of listeners’ demand alone predicts large increases in ad quantity.
              | However in the data, we observe smaller increases or even decrease in the quantity
              | supplied, depending on the market. Those differences are rationalized by a negative
              | value of CPP slope, θ2A .

heading       | 2.6.1     Listeners’ demand
text          | Table 2.3 contains estimates of demand parameters for radio programming. The esti-
              | mate of the mean effect of advertising on listeners’ utility is negative and statistically
              | significant. This is consistent with the belief that radio listeners have a disutility for
              | advertising. When it comes to the mean effects of programming formats, Contempo-
              | rary Hit Radio format gives the most utility, while the News/Talk format gives the
              | least.
              |    The second column of Table 2.3 contains variances of random effects for station
              | formats. The higher a format’s variance, the more persistent are the tastes of listeners
              | for that format. For example, in response to an increased amount of advertising, if
              | the variance of the random effect for that format is high, listeners tend to switch
              | to a station of the same format. The estimates also suggest that tastes for the
              | Alternative/Urban format are the most persistent.
              |    Table 2.4 contains estimates of interactions between listener characteristics and
              | format dummies. The majority of the parameters are consistent with intuition. For
              | example, younger people are more willing to choose a CHR format while older people
              | go for News/Talk. The negative coefficients on the interaction of Hispanic format
              | with education and income suggests that less educated Hispanic people with lower
              | income are more willing to listen to Hispanic stations. For blacks, I find a disutility
              | for Country, Rock and Hispanic, and a high utility for Urban. This is consistent
              | with the the fact that Urban radio stations play mostly rap, hip-hop and soul music
              | performed by black artists.

              | News/Talk is close to AC and Urban is close to CHR. This can be explained by, for
              | example, the age of the listeners. In the former case the formats appeal to an older

text          | The marginal costs of selling advertising minutes are presented in Table 2.7. The
              | values of this cost range from $356 per minute of advertising sold in Los Angeles,
              | CA to $11 in Ft. Myers, FL. 66% of the variation in marginal cost can be explained
              | by variation in market population. A population increase of one thousand translates
              | to about a 2 cent increase in marginal cost (with t-stat equal to 12). The high cor-

              | of revenue with population will translate into a high correlation of marginal cost with

              |    From the revenues and marginal cost estimates, I can calculate variable profit
              | margins. These are presented in the last last column of Table 2.7. The range is
              | from 92% in Shreveport, LA to 15% in Honolulu, HI and Reno, NV. It is interesting
              | that 38% of the profit margin variation can be explained by the variance in total ad
              | quantity supplied and markets with high profit margins firms supply more advertising.

              | 0.6% of extra profit margin.

text          | In this section I investigate the impact of consolidation on listener and advertiser
              | welfare. First, I investigate the changes in the surplus of listeners and advertisers. In
              | particular, I calculate how much market power was exercised on both of those groups.
              | Second, I decompose market power into a variety component and extra market power
              | that is manifested in changes in quantity supplied.
              |    Before performing counterfactual calculations, consider descriptive relationships
              | between concentration and prices. First, I regressed market Price Per Rating Point
              | on a market’s HHI, including market fixed effects. I find that higher concentration is
              | correlated with higher prices in the advertising market, suggesting that radio station
              | owners are exercising some amount of market power on advertisers. Second, I re-
              | gressed total advertising supplied on the market’s HHI with market dummies. Here I
              | get a coefficient of 1.65(0.3). This is evidence of market power in the listener market.
              | Because market power appears to be present in both market segments, I cannot defi-
              | nitely conclude who had more surplus extracted by radio station owners if I just use
              | quantities and prices. In the next subsection I present the structural counterfactuals
              | that answer this question.

              |    The total impact of consolidation on advertiser and listener welfare is presented
              | in the last row of Table 2.8. It turns out that mergers decrased total ad quantity
              | by roughtly 14 thousand minutes. That resulted in lowering average ad exposure
              | by 4.8 persons-day-minutes (pdm), which is about 10% of the total ad load. The
              | changes translated to about a 4.7 pdm increase in consumer welfare. Because we
              | do not observe dollar prices in the listenership market we cannot compute the dollar
              | value of this compensating variation. However, we can compute a rough estimate
              | using the prices for the satellite radio. If we assume people buy satelite radio just
              | to avoid advertising, we get a rough estimate of 1.5 cents per minute, or 730million
              | dollars for each person-day-minute per year. The total effect would amount to $3.5b.
              | This is of course a very loose upper bound on the overall welfare gain, however if
              | make a conservative assumption that only 10% of the value of satellite radio is lack
              | of advertising, we get $350m.
              |    For advertisers, a decrease in quantity supplied leads to about 2.57% increase in

text          | per-listener prices, or a $300m decrease in advertiser surplus. I therefore conclude
              | that the Telecom Act lead to a reallocation of surplus from advertisers to listenerss.
              | Moreover, because the gain by listeners ($350m) is larger than the surplus lost by
              | advertisers, I find that the Act created new surplus. This increase can be explained
              | by the fact that listeners are more annoyed by ads than the value of an ad to the
              | advertisers.
              |       A deeper story can be told by looking seperately at small versus large markets.
              | As mentioned in the previous section, radio stations have considerable control over
              | prices in small markets, and no control in the large markets. Motivated by this fact,
              | I present counterfactuals for markets with less than 0.5 population and more than
              | 2m population. In smaller markets (see Table 2.9), stations contract advertising to
              | exercise market power on advertisers. They supply more than 10,000 minutes less of
              | advertising. That translates into a 7.3pdm decrease in ad exposure, which increases
              | consumer surplus by 11.6pdm. However, prices rise by 6.4%, and cause a $230m
              | loss in advertiser surplus. On the other hand in large markets (see Table 2.10) firms
              | supply more than 2,000 extra minutes of advertising, which lowers consumer surplus
              | by almost 2pdm. On balance, this does not affect advertiser surplus. I conclude that
              | listeners gained form the Telecom Act only in small markets.

heading       | 2.7.2        Effects of product variety and market power
text          | Berry and Waldfogel (2001) suggest that the negative effects of ownership consolida-
              | tion on listeners might be mitigated by format switching. They find that post-merger
              | repositioning results in spatial competition leading to more variety, which they as-
              | sume is beneficial for the listeners 4 . To quantify this effect, I compare surpluses
              | computed imposing 1996 ownership and formats with surpluses computed imposing
              | actual ownership and formats without ad quantity adjustments. That is, I fix ad
              | quantities computed with 1996 ownership and formats. The results of this experi-
              | ment are presented in the first row of Table 2.8. It turns out that if I do not account
              | for quantity changes, the assertion of Berry and Waldfogel (2001) is true. In this

              | mat switching. Listener surplus grows because of two factors: increased variety and
              | decreased advertising exposure. The latter decreased even though I keep number of
              | ad minutes fixed. However, in the real world, repositioning changes firms’ incentives
              | to set ad quantity, because it softens competition in the advertising market. The im-
              | pact of quantity readjustments is presented in the middle row of Table 2.8. It turns
              | out that both listeners and advertisers are worse off due to quantity adjustments.
              | Listeners lose 1.9pdm and advetisers lose additional $150m in surplus.

heading       | 2.8     Robustness analysis
text          | This section examines the robustness of my advertising model to different assumptions
              | about competition among station formats. This step is motivated by the fact that
              | the data concerning advertiser deals is incomplete. I deal with the incompleteness by
              | proposing a stilyzed decision model for advertisers that uses publicly available data
              | to predict substitution patterns between formats. These patterns directly detemine
              | the market power of stations over advertsers, and can potentially alter the results of
              | counterfactual experiments.
              |    To investigate the robustness of the results, I reestimated the model under two
              | alternative assumptions. The first scenario represents the extreme situation in which
              | formats compete only between themselves. In particular, suppose that advertiser
              | types get utility from only one particular format. In this case, equation (2.6) has
              | ωf f = 1 and ωf f 0 = 0 if f 6= f 0 . The second scenario represents another extreme in
              | which formats are perfect substitutes, i.e., there is only one type of advertiser who
              | values all formats in the same way. Formally this means that ωf f 0 = 1/8, because
              | there are 8 possible formats. The estimated model is in a sense in-between the these
              | extreme alternatives, because it assumes that formats are imperfect substitutes.
              |    Estimates of the inverse demand advertising slopes are presented in Table 2.11.
              | The estimates show that the baseline model lies between the two extremes. When we
              | assume oligopoly within a format, the estimated slope parameter θ2L is smaller than
              | the one in the baseline model. On the other hand in the perfect substitutes model,

              | differences between the different models, the main qualitative assertion, that stations
              | have more power in smaller markets, still holds. In order to assess the economic impli-
              | cation of those differences, I recomputed the estimated profit margin under different
              | models. It turns out that the model with format oligopoly predicts on average a 2.4%
              | higher profit margins than the baseline model. Conversely the model with perfect

text          | In this paper I analyze mergers in two-sided markets on the example of the 1996-2006

              | quantify how mergers in the two-sided market differ from a differentiated product

text          | oligopoly setting. I make two main contributions. First, I recognize the fact two-
              | sided markets consist of two types of consumers, who may be affected by the merger in
              | different ways. For example, if extra market power causes the radio station to increase
              | advertising, it will benefit consumers but hurt advertisers. Second, I disaggregate the
              | impact of a merger on consumers into changes in the variety of available products
              | and changes in supplied quantity of ads.
              |       Radio is an important medium in the U.S., reaching about 94% of Americans
              | twelve years old or older each week. Moreover, the average consumer listens to about
              | 20h of radio per week and between 6am and 6pm more people use radio than TV
              | or print media5 . In 1996 the Telecommunication Act deregulated the industry by
              | raising local ownership caps. This deregulation caused a massive merger wave, that
              | reshaped the ownership structure, by moving from family based ownership into more
              | corporate structures. I estimate that this consolidation raised consumer surplus by
              | 1%, but lowered advertiser surplus by $300m. I find that the mergers created extra
              | variety that increased listener welfare by $1.3%. On the other hand they softened
              | competition and decreased advertiser welfare by $147m per year. Subsequent ad
              | quantity adjustments led to a 0.3% decrease in listener welfare (with the variety
              | effect it totals to the 1% increase) and an additional $153m decrease in advertiser
              | welfare (with the variety effect it totals $300m).

              | Application to U.S. radio

heading       | 3.1     Preface
text          | This chapter develops a new way to estimate cost synergies from mergers without
              | using actual data on cost. The estimator uses a structural model in which companies
              | play a dynamic game with endogenous mergers and product repositioning decisions.
              | Such a formulation has several benefits over the widespread static merger analysis.
              | In particular, it corrects for sample selection of more profitable mergers and captures
              | follow-up mergers and post-merger product repositioning.
              |    The framework is applied to estimate cost efficiencies after the deregulation of
              | U.S. radio in 1996. The procedure uses the data on radio station characteristics
              | and numerous acquisitions, without explicit need for cost data. It turns out that
              | between 1996 and 2006 additional ownership concentration generated $2.5b per-year
              | cost savings, which is about 10% of total industry revenue.

heading       | 3.2      Introduction
text          | The extent to which a potential merger generates cost efficiencies is often mentioned
              | by managers as a major motivation to merge. Moreover, potential fixed cost savings
              | generated by a merger are recognized by the Horizontal Merger Guidelines as a fac-
              | tor that can provide consumers with direct price-related as well as non-price-related
              | benefits. Thus, for antitrust purposes one should evaluate cost savings in addition
              | to measuring the decrease in competition. However, this approach is rarely used in
              | practice, because in most cases reliable cost data are unavailable. This paper pro-
              | vides a solution to this problem, by proposing a method to estimate cost synergies
              | without using any data on cost. This method requires only panel data on the own-
              | ership structure, product characteristics, and prices and quantities, information that
              | in most cases is easily accessible.
              |    Evaluating the underlying causes of ownership consolidation requires a dynamic
              | model in which mergers are endogenous. However, most past empirical work analyzed
              | mergers in a static framework and treats market structure as given. Papers by Nevo
              | (2000), Pinkse and Slade (2004), Ivaldi and Verboven (2005) exogenously impose
              | changes in market structure on a static equilibrium model and calculate counterfactual
              | changes in prices and welfare. These models are very useful in addressing the short
              | run impacts of mergers but do not account for changes in market structure that
              | might happen as a result of a merger. Benkard, Bodoh-Creed, and Lazarev (2008)
              | evaluate the longer run effects of a merger on market structure, but still treat it
              | as an exogenous one-time event. Neither of these approaches allows for estimating
              | the supply side determinants of mergers, such as cost synergies. Furthermore, the
              | assumption that mergers are exogenous may create a selection bias that results in
              | overestimating the cost synergies (we might pick up other unobserved components
              | correlated with the propensity to merge). Furthermore, recent models assume away
              | follow-up mergers and post-merger repositioning of products.
              |    To address these issues, I propose a dynamic model in the spirit of Gowrisankaran
              | (1999) in which mergers and product positioning are endogenous and are assumed to
              | happen sequentially. Such an approach enables me to estimate the cost efficiencies

text          | of consolidation without any data on cost. It also eliminates the shortcomings men-
              | tioned earlier, because it incorporates the dynamic processes directly into the model.
              | Moreover, endogenizing mergers allows for correction of sample selection by using a
              | procedure in the spirit of Heckman (1979), adjusted for a dynamic game environment.
              |    The model is subsequently applied to analyze ownership consolidation in the U.S.
              | radio industry. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 increased local-market radio
              | station ownership caps, triggering an unprecedented merger wave that had the effect
              | of eliminating many small and independent radio owners. From 1996 to 2006, the
              | average Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) in local radio markets grew from 0.18
              | to 0.26, the average number of owners in the market dropped from 16.6 to 12.4,
              | and the average number of stations owned grew from 1.6 to 2.3. Such dramatic
              | changes to the market structure have raised concerns about anti-competitive aspects
              | of the deregulation (Leeper (1999), Drushel (1998), Klein (1997)). After estimating
              | the model using the method of Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2004), I find that the
              | main incentives to merge in radio come from the cost side. Total cost side savings
              | amount to $2.5b per year, constituting about 10% of total industry revenue. Such
              | cost synergies are an order of magnitude higher than the anti-competetive effects of
              | these mergers identified by Jeziorski (2010). Moreover, the fact that consolidation
              | leads to substantial cost side synergies leads me to conclude that the Telecom Act
              | made radio advertising more competitive against other media, such as TV or the
              | Internet.
              |    To my knowledge, Gowrisankaran (1999) is the only applied paper that uses a
              | dynamic framework to endogenize mergers. His analysis argued that merger dynamics
              | are very important. The main drawback of his analysis is that it was never fit to
              | real data. This was due in part to the complexity of his model and in part to
              | the lack of a good dataset. To solve the complexity problem, I utilize the latest
              | developments in the dynamic-games literature. These developments enable us to
              | estimate very complicated models without explicitly solving them (Bajari, Benkard,
              | and Levin (2004)). This paper also contributes to empirical literature on demand
              | and cost curve estimation (this started with Rosse (1970) and Rosse (1967)), by
              | accounting explicitly for the demand side incentives to merge. On the technical side,

text          | my model shares some similarities with Sweeting (2007). I concentrate on questions
              | about incentives to merge and the impact of consolidation on welfare, while Sweeting
              | focuses mainly on estimates of the format switching cost. My analysis also extends
              | his model by adding a model of ad quantity choices and endogenous mergers. Another
              | paper on a similar topic is O’Gorman and Smith (2008). They use a static oligopoly
              | model to estimate the cost curve in radio. They find that the fixed cost savings when
              | owning two stations is bounded between between 20% and 50% of per-station costs
              | (I estimate this number to be 20%). I supplement their estimates by accounting for
              | selection bias, follow-up mergers and post-merger repositioning as outlined above.
              |    This chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a flexible, structural
              | merger model that can applied to many industries. The estimation procedure is
              | discussed in Section 3. Section 4 describes the application of the framework to analyze
              | the merger wave in the U.S. radio industry. Section 5 concludes the paper.

heading       | 3.3     Merger and repositioning framework
text          | This section presents the dynamic oligopoly model of an industry with differentiated
              | products in the spirit of Ericson and Pakes (1995). The industry is modeled as a
              | dynamic game and the players are companies holding portfolios of different products
              | (brands). The modeling effort emphasizes the actions of companies changing the
              | profolio of owned products, specifically rebranding and acquisitions. The model is
              | general enough to encompass a number of different industries and types of competi-
              | tion, by allowing for a large range of different single-period profit functions and cost
              | structures.

              | ξjt ∈ Ξ is a continuous characteristic of the product. The state of the industry at the

heading       | 3.3.2     Players’ actions
text          | Firms can undertake two types of actions: product acquisitions and product repo-
              | sitioning. I assume that acquisitions take place first and the results are common
              | knowledge before the firms commence with repositioning.
              |    In general, the product acquisition process can be very complicated. Firms can
              | acquire any subset of products owned by competitors, and multiple firms can bid to
              | acquire the same product. Therefore, the most general model of this process is likely to
              | be intractable both analytically and numerically. Additionally, the model of mergers
              | without additional structure is likely to generate multiple equilibria, which will sig-
              | nificantly complicate its estimation. To solve these problems, I follow Gowrisankaran
              | (1999) and I assume that the station acquisition process is sequential. Owners move
              | in a sequence specified by a function A : st 7→ i, where i is a permutation of the active
              | owners’ index {1, . . . , K}. In addition, for notational purposes, I set i(K +1) = K +1.

text          | Consider parameterizations of the fixed cost F (stk |θF ) and the switching cost

              | Levin (2004), to obtain consistent estimators of θF and θC without using direct data
              | on cost.

text          | the cost. This is convenient since most of the data on cost suffers from accounting
              | issues. Therefore direct cost estimates from the data might be unreliable.
              |    To facilitate the inference process a standard assumption about the data gen-
              | erating process is made: that it is generated by a single MPE strategy profile g∗ .
              | Crucially, the dataset needs to contain a reasonable amount of within market acqui-
              | sitions and repositioning to allows it to identify equilibrium strategies. Sometimes it
              | is possible to obtain such datasets within one industry (see U.S. radio in the appli-
              | cation), however for most industries such datasets are unavailable. In this case, it is
              | possible to pool similar industries to construct one dataset. To make this work one
              | needs a slightly stronger assumption that equilibrium behavior is the same across the
              | pooled industries.
              |    The transaction prices are helpful but not necessary to identify the cost parame-
              | ters. Estimation is possible without them but it requires more assumptions about the
              | bargaining process during the acquisition, as well as much more computing power.
              | The extra steps needed to proceed without the prices are mentioned in Appendix B.1.
              |    In order to simplify the exposition all state variables are assumed to be observed.
              | However, the procedure also applies to problems in which some payoff relevant in-
              | formation is unobserved to the econometrician. In many cases one can infer the
              | unobserved state variable from a static estimation of the one-shot profit function π̄.
              | One example of such a case is Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) estimator, which
              | uses differences of static market shares to identify unobserved product quality. More-
              | over, there are numerous ways to proceed in case one cannot directly infer all the
              | latent state variables. For example, one could supply the procedure from this chapter
              | with an EM algorithm proposed by Arcidiacono and Miller (2010).

              | situation changed with the Telecom Act of 1996 which, among other things, raised
              | the ownership caps in the local markets (see Table 3.1).
              |       This triggered an unprecedented merger and product repositioning wave that com-
              | pletely reshaped the industry. Figure 3.1 contains the average percentage of stations
              | that switched owners and that switched formats. Between 1996 and 2000 more than
              | 10% of stations switched owners annually. After 2000 the number dropped to less
              | than 4%. Greater ownership concentration in the 1996-2000 period was also associ-
              | ated with more format switching. The percentage of stations that switched formats
              | peaked in 1998 and 2001 at 13%. In effect, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) in
              | the listenership market grew from 0.18 in 1996 to about 0.3 in 2006.
              |       The impact of this consolidation on consumer surplus has been studied before
              | using a static demand and supply approach. For example Jeziorski (2010) (Chapter
              | 2 of this thesis), finds that consolidation of ownership in this industry was harmful
              | to advertisers, causing $300m loss in advertiser surplus, but beneficial to listeners,
              | raising the welfare by 1%.
              |       In order to analyze the supply side effects of this consolidation, I compiled a
              | dataset 6 . on stations in the 88 markets studied by Jeziorski (2010). The data
              | contains ownership for each station oj , and station format fj . It uses the estimates of
              | station quality ξj , contained in Jeziorski (2010). I also observe each acquisition made
              | in this market and the average acquisition price.

heading       | 3.5.3        Estimation details
text          | The estimation is a direct application of the framework desribed in subsection 3.4.
              | The model endogenizes acquisition decisions and format switching decisions. The
              | dynamics in an unobserved radio station quality ξ is assumed to be exogenous.
              |        The first piece of the model that needs to be specified is the function I(st , dt ),
              | that prescribes the sequence of moves firms make in the merger and repositioning
              | process. Following Gowrisankaran (1999), I assume that firms with the biggest total
              | market shares move first. This is motivated by the fact that the bigger players in the
              | market might a have first-mover advantage over smaller players. The acquisition price
              | is assumed to be constant within market and equal to the observed mean acquisition
              | price.
              |        To estimate the merger probability I use the method outlined in the Example
              | 3.4.3. Each owner considers, one at a time, stations to acquire, starting from the
              | one with the highest quality measure ξj , and moving down according to ξj 7 . A flow
              | chart of the merger process is presented in the Appendix B.2. Such structure enables

text          | Tables B.3 and B.4 report coefficients from a purchase strategy probit approxima-
              | tion. They reveal that owners with larger market shares are more likely to purchase
              | new stations and are less likely to sell. Also, there are synergies when purchasing
              | multiple stations. The coefficient on the first purchase dummy PUR0 is negative while
              | coefficients on dummies for multiple purchases are positive. This indicates that it
              | is easier to negotiate the purchase of many stations, or even an entire company at
              | once, than a single station. The number of owned stations in the format (the FORMAT
              | variable in the table) has a negative influence on purchase decisions. This is evidence
              | for diversification. The coefficient of station quality is positive which suggests that
              | stations with higher quality are purchased more often.
              |    Table B.5 presents the influence on future format of the following covariates:
              | change of ownership dummy, AM/FM status, and previous format. The negative
              | coefficient of a Spanish format in the first row of the table suggests that when a
              | station is purchased it is less likely to switch to Spanish format. On the other hard,
              | the positive coefficient of AC tells us that change in ownership is correlated with
              | switching to the Adult Contemporary format. The second column of the table shows
              | that FM stations are likely be of Rock or CHR format, and not so likely to be of
              | News/Talk format. The remaining rows of the table describe the Markov dynamics
              | of formats. The diagonal cells have much higher numbers than the off-diagonal ones,
              | which reflects the fact that staying in the current format is much more probable than

              | information concerning the dynamics of the demographics (the difference between
              | two consecutive periods) and format switching. One can observe many patterns that
              | suggest firms respond to the current state of population demographics as well as to the
              | dynamics of population demographics. For example, a larger current population and
              | growth of the Hispanic population is ralated to the stations switching to a Hispanic
              | format. One can observe a similar pattern for Blacks and the Urban format, as well as
              | for older people and the News/Talk format. Those patters largely reflect correlations
              | between tastes for formats and demographics described in Jeziorski (2010).

text          | The estimated parameters of the fixed cost equation (3.5) are as follows: θ̂C1 = 0.69
              | and θ̂C2 = 0.59. Table 3.2 interprets the economic significance of these parameters in
              | terms the amount of saved fixed costs per year if two stations are commonly owned
              | compared to being separate companies. Since the amount of cost synergies depends on
              | the market population, only three representative markets are presented. Los Angeles
              | is the biggest market in the sample and the cost savings in that market amount to
              | about $4.4m per-year (roughly 10% of the revenue of a big station). Knoxville is
              | representative of medium markets and has about $0.23m of such cost savings, and
              | Bismark, a small market, has about $34k of savings. Table 3.3 presents total cost
              | savings from all mergers after the Telecom Act was passed. It turns out that the
              | merger activity lowered the fixed cost of providing radio programming by almost
              | $2.5b, amounting to almost 10% of the total revenue of the industry. Compared to
              | that, the impact on advertiser surplus identified in Jeziorski (2010) is very small. This
              | leads me to conclude that the deregulation of 1996 provided substantial operational
              | efficients that outweigh negative impacts on advertiser welfare.

              | them to avoid cannibalization. However, if the switching costs are high, it might be
              | optimal to avoid paying them and purchase a station further away. The previous

heading       | 3.6     Conclusions
text          | This paper proposed a new estimator of a production cost curve that enables the
              | identification of cost synergies from mergers. The estimation uses inequalities rep-
              | resenting an equilibrium of a dynamic game with endogenous mergers and product
              | repositioning decisions.
              |    The biggest advantage of this estimator is that it enables the identification of
              | the cost curve just from merger decisions, without using cost data. Since reliable
              | cost data is very hard to obtain, the cost side analysis of mergers was very hard to
              | perform. This method is able to solve this problem, and provides a powerful tool for
              | policy makers to improve their merger assessments.
              |    Since the proposed method is based on a fully dynamic framework, it additionally
              | solves many of the problems of static merger analysis. First of all, endogenizing the
              | merger decision allows for sample selection on unobservables in the estimation and
              | correcting for the fact that only the most profitable mergers are carried out. Moreover,
              | I allow for follow-up mergers and merger waves. Additionally, endogenizing product
              | characteristics enables correction for post-merger product repositioning.
              |    The estimator belongs to a class of indirect estimators proposed by Hotz, Miller,
              | Sanders, and Smith (1994) and Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2004). Therefore, it
              | shares all the benefits of those estimators, such as conceptual simplicity of imple-
              | mentation and computational feasibility, because it avoids the computation of an
              | equilibrium. However, it also shares their downsides, such as a loss in efficiency.
              |    The estimator was applied to analyze the cost side benefits of a deregulation of the
              | U.S. radio industry. It turns out that the consolidation wave in that industry between
              | 1996 and 2006 provided substantial cost synergies. These amounted to about 2 billion
              | dollars per, year and constitute about 10% of industry revenue. Such benefits are an
              | order of magnitude larger than potential losses in advertiser welfare found by Jeziorski
              | (2010). This provides a significant argument for the supporters of a deregulation bill,
              | and serves as an example of how cost curve estimation can provide additional insights
              | supplementing traditional merger analysis.

text          | In this section I present a model that rationalizes inverse demand for advertising (2.5)
              |    Assume that there are A types of advertisers. Each type a ∈ A targets a certain
              | demographic group(s) da . Let γ2 be a total mass of advertisers and ASa be a share of
              | advertisers of type a in market m. Advertisers are also heterogeneous in their value
              | of the ad slot in format f , and I assume that those values are distributed uniformly
              | on the interval [0, γ1f ]. An advertiser of type a gets utility only if a listener of type da
              | hears an ad. To compute the exact expected value of an advertising slot, advertisers
              | need to know the demographic composition of each station in the market. Because
              | advertisers are small, and such detailed data is not offered by Arbitron, it seems
              | unlikely that they would be able to do that. Instead, I assume that they approximate
              | those calculations using publicly available data contained in Arbitron’s Radio Today
              | publications. These publications provide nation-wide conditional probabilities rf |a
              | of a consumer of type da choosing format f conditional on listening to the radio.
              | Advertisers take these conditional probabilities as given and compute the market
              | specific probabilities of obtaining correct listeners when advertising in each format.
              | Such computations can be done by Bayes’ Rule, i.e.

              |     Radio stations quote costs-per-point CPPaf individually for each advertiser type

heading       | A.2         Numerical considerations
text          | To solve the optimization problem (2.12), I used a version of the Gauss-Newton
              | method implemented in the commercial solver KNITRO. Using this state-of-the-art
              | solver avoids certain convergence problems that are common to many non-linear es-
              | timators.
              |    The iteration step of the KNITRO solver requires computing constraints, a Jaco-
              | bian of the constraint, and an inverse of the inner product of this Jacobian (used to
              | compute the approximate Hessian of the Lagrangian). The objective function and its
              | Jacobian come essentially for free because of their simple nature.
              |    To compute the constraints and their Jacobian, I employed a piece of highly opti-
              | mized parallel C code. This allows the use a fairly large dataset (about 42,000 obser-
              | vations) and many draws (500 draws from Normal and CPS per date/market) when
              | computing the constraints. When parallelizing the code, I was careful to maintain
              | independence of the draws within and between threads. To achieve this, I imple-
              | mented a version of a pseudo-random number generator (described in (L’Ecuyer and

text          | Andres 1997). This generator enables us to create a desired number of independent
              | pseudo-random feeds for each thread.
              |    One iteration of the solver takes about two to three minutes on an 8-Core 3Ghz
              | Intel Xeon processor and uses about 4GB of memory. About 90% of this computation
              | is the inversion of a Hessian estimator within the KNITRO solver. This inversion
              | cannot be parallelized because it is done inside the solver, without the user’s control.

              | In case the pricing function P̂jk cannot be estimated in the first state because of data
              | constraint, one could employ a bargaining model for infer it. Suppose one employs
              | a parametrization P̂ (ω|θP ). For an initial value of parameters θP0 one could compute
              | a surplus from acquisition of the product j by an owner k using simulated V̂kt and
              | V̂kt0 where k 0 is the current owner of product j. Then using a bargaining model
              | one could infer prices and fit a new parametrization θP1 . If repeating this procedure
              | leads to convergence, then obtain a parametrization θ̂P and value functions V̂kt that
              | are consistent with eachother. The detailed description of this procedure is given
              | in the Algorithm 1. The big dowside of this approch is that one needs resolve this
              | procedure for any set of cost parameters and cannot take advantage of linearing
              | of the value function. It makes the procedure infeasible to use for large datasets
              | because of computational burden. However, given the rapid hardware development
              | it is reasonable to think it it would be feasible in the near future.
