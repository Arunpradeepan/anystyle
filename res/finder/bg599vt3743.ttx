text          | The interactions between periodic, progressive, two-layer interfacial waves and a
              | Gaussian ridge are investigated through laboratory experiments. In mild wave-ridge
              | interactions, higher harmonic waves can be excited whereas more intense interactions
              | can result in wave breaking and mixing. Higher harmonic waves excited in mild
              | wave-ridge interactions then propagate downstream independently of the primary
              | wave. The amount of energy transferred to higher harmonic frequencies increases
              | with the non-linearity of the main wave over the ridge crest. When the wave non-
              | linearity is increased to the point where breaking occurs over the ridge, harmonic
              | generation can still occur. The length scale of the obstacle relative to the wavelength
              | can also influence the energy transfer, which is consistent with analogous surface wave
              | studies. The upper limit for which harmonic frequencies can be excited is set by the
              | stratification. This wave-topography interaction provides a possible mechanism for
              | transferring energy in the internal wave field to smaller scales.
              |    For wave-ridge interactions resulting in wave breaking, length scales of the inci-
              | dent wave and topography are used to parameterize when and how breaking occurs.
              | Qualitative observations suggest both shear and convection play a role in the in-
              | stability of waves breaking at the ridge. Simultaneous particle image velocimetry
              | (PIV) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) measurements are used to cal-
              | culate high resolution, 2D velocity and density fields from which the local gradient
              | Richardson number, Rig , is calculated. The transition to breaking occurred when
              | 0.2 ≤ Rig ≤ 0.4. In these wave-ridge breaking events, the destabilizing effects of
              | waves steepening in shallow layers may be responsible for breaking at higher Rig than
              | for similar waves breaking through shear instability in deep water (Troy & Koseff,
blank         |

text          | 2005b). Due to the effects of unsteadiness, non-linear shoaling, and flow separation,
              | the canonical Rig > 0.25 is not sufficient to predict the stability of interfacial waves.
              | A simple model is developed to estimate Rig in waves between finite depth layers
              | using scales of the incident wave scale and topography. The observed breaking tran-
              | sition corresponds with a constant estimated value of Rig from the model, suggesting
              | that interfacial shear plays an important role in initial wave instability. For wave
              | amplitudes above the initial breaking transition, convective breaking events are also
              | observed.
              |    An understanding of the efficiency with which internal waves mix the ocean is of
              | critical importance to modeling ocean dynamics. The overall event efficiency is de-
              | fined here as the energy converted irreversibly to potential energy as a fraction of the
              | total energy lost in the wave breaking event. Using the tank as a control volume, the
              | distribution of energy into reflected waves, transmitted waves as well as dissipation
              | and irreversible mixing from the breaking event can be determined. Reflection from
              | the ridge varies with the length scale of the wave, but is not impacted by whether or
              | not the waves are breaking. The overall event efficiency is found to be 3 − 8% ± 1%,
              | increasing slightly with the incident wave amplitude. Spatial variation in the mixing
              | processes may explain why the overall event efficiency is lower than typical values
              | of around 20% for stratified shear instabilities. Local measurements of velocity and
              | density gradients indicate that the local mixing efficiency may vary significantly for
              | different regions in the flow. While there is significant wave energy dissipated within
              | the lower layer over the ridge, there are essentially no density gradients to mix leading
              | to a very low local mixing efficiency. On the other hand, parameterizations based on
              | the turbulent Reynolds number and Froude number suggest that the local mixing
              | efficiency is 10 − 17% within the overturning patch at the interface. This variation
              | within mixing processes reinforces the importance of dynamic mixing efficiency pa-
              | rameterizations based local stratified turbulence parameters.

text          | I have many people to thank for supporting me in this research. First, I thank my
              | advisor Jeff Koseff for being the most supportive advisor I could have imagined. Jeff’s
              | enthusiasm knows no bounds, despite my best attempts to quash it with skepticism.
              | So many times I entered Jeff’s office stumped only to leave with a half dozen new
              | ways to approach the problem and a better sense how the issue at hand fits into a
              | broad context. Although he may be anxious to see the next plot, Jeff has been both
              | encouraging and patient when I have been stuck. The knowledge that Jeff will go to
              | bat for me, no matter the situation, has been a wind at my back. This research would
              | not have happened without the efforts of Cary Troy, who taught me to break internal
              | waves with patience, humor, and more patience. Cary has a unique ability to be both
              | creative in the design of experiments and diligent in the execution. With Springsteen,
              | laughter, and a nice sharp interface, the rest will follow. Stephen Monismith provided
              | great new research questions as well as critical support for the laboratory facility as
              | a whole. I have really appreciated Oliver Fringer’s willingness to meet and discuss
              | ideas and progress. His advice on getting the ball rolling and planning publications
              | has been invaluable. This work has benefitted greatly from conversations with other
              | scientists, including Greg Ivey, Derek Stretch and Peter Diamessis.
              |    The people of the EFML have been great. The staff, Jill Nomura, Bob Brown
              | and Bill Sabala, were incredibly helpful in figuring out the details, and keeping the
              | facility in shape. Mike and Sarah have been in it with me since the beginning–I
              | almost feel like I have two more siblings. I feel very lucky to have had classmates as
              | motivated, supportive and snarky as you both. Since you can’t do research all of the
              | time, I am very grateful to have had Nicole to play squash, Liv to eat lunch, Jonah to

              | research?), as well as Joel, Kristen, Jim, Nick, Johanna, Mike B., Eena, Rica, Diana,
              | Gerard, Zhonghua, Derek and all of the folks who make the lab what it is. I have
              | had great officemates: Karan, Gang, Sarah, Daniel and Mike S., who humored my
              | ridiculous questions and helped find more rational solutions. I also want to thank
              | Parker, Rocky, Sally and the rest of the gang from FHL who got me energized about
              | the larger world of physical oceanography. S.F, L.D., the Jerks, the Mother Cluckers
              | and the Shenanigans were all critical in keeping me grounded over the years.
              |    My training begun long before I arrived at Stanford. I have been lucky to have
              | had many inspirational teachers over the years. I want thank Mrs. Platt without
              | whom this thesis would still be a blank page, Mr. Quaden and Tree for making math
              | and science a fun challenge, Parkman for helping me to organize my thoughts, Max,
              | Gary and Pete for their energy, Brian for covering so much material and for building
              | the confidence to take it all in, Professors McKinley, Brisson, and Lienhard, for an
              | appreciation of the elegance of fluid mechanics, and Professors Dori and Glicksman
              | for getting me hooked on research. Lastly, I want to thank my mom, my dad, Lauren,
              | Jason and of course Laura for never being anything but enthusiastic about my work.
              | At the end of the day, it is very comforting to be reminded that there is much more
              | to this world than the intricacies of shear instability criteria and PIV processing.
              |    My scholarship at Stanford was made possible by the John K. Vennard Fellowship,
              | a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship as well as a National
              | Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship.

text          | One possible impetus for abrupt and potentially devastating change in the earth’s
              | climate is the alteration of the ocean circulation. Historical evidence and simulation
              | results suggest that the input of freshwater from melting glaciers to the Arctic ocean
              | can help to shut down large scale ocean currents, such as the Atlantic thermohaline
              | circulation, which in turn can have a dramatic impact on climate McManus et al.
              | (2004); Zhang & Delworth (2005). The numerical models used for climate prediction
              | rely on accurate parameterization of small scale processes involved in the ocean cir-
              | culation. Among the small scale processes involved in global scale ocean circulation
              | is the breaking of internal waves: the main source of vertical mixing in the ocean
              | and the focus of this study (e.g., Wunsch & Ferrari, 2004). Because the ocean has
              | the aspect ratio of a piece of paper, one might assume that vertical motions can be
              | neglected in climate modeling, but this is not the case. The large scale overturning
              | circulation in the ocean is driven, at least in part, by internal waves mixing heat from
              | the surface of the ocean down into the interior (Munk & Wunsch, 1998; Huang, 1999;
              | Kuhlbrodt et al., 2007). In this study, laboratory experiments are used to improve
              | the understanding of how internal waves mix the ocean.
              |    Long before global warming was a household phrase, oceanographers were in-
              | trigued by the possibility that internal wave breaking may be mixing the ocean. Con-
              | sider, for a moment, the ocean heat budget. At the surface of the ocean, the water
              | is warmed through the absorption of sunlight and then mixed by wind and waves to

text          | create a warm, relatively well-mixed layer. Ocean water is cooled near the icy poles,
              | where solar heating is lowest, and then plummets downwards as the density drops
              | below that of the surrounding waters. This cooler water mass then spreads out into
              | surrounding oceans. Without some mechanism to mix heat and mass downward from
              | the warm, surface mixed layer, the ocean would slowly fill with this cold, dense water
              | (Munk, 1966). In order to sustain the temperature profile observed in the ocean inte-
              | rior, heat must be mixed downward from the surfaced mixed layer at a rate sufficient
              | to offset the downward convection of cold water at the poles. Based on the scalar
              | conservation model of Munk (1966), a vertical diffusivity of κρ ≈ 10−4 m2 /s as well
              | as constant vertical upwelling are required to sustain the observed temperature pro-
              | file. Measurements consistently indicate, however, that the vertical diffusivity in the
              | ocean interior is an order of magnitude lower, approximately 10−5 m2 /s(e.g., Munk &
              | Wunsch, 1998). It is now believed that the vertical mixing necessary to balance the
              | heat budget is not widely distributed over the ocean interior, as was once thought.
              | Extremely high vertical diffusivities have been observed in areas above very rough
              | bottom bathymetry (Toole et al., 1997; Polzin et al., 1997; Lueck & Mudge, 1997;
              | Ledwell et al., 2000), thought to be caused by internal wave breaking at bathymetry.
              | Instead of distributed vertical mixing throughout the ocean interior, majority of verti-
              | cal mixing may occur due to internal wave breaking at localized topographic hotspots.
              | The resulting mixed fluid is then advected into the interior of the ocean, leading to
              | a relatively stable temperature profile. It appears that internal wave-driven mixing
              | at boundaries may be sufficient to support the observed temperature profile (Wunsch
              | & Ferrari, 2004). A better understanding of the breaking processes through which
              | internal wave energy is converted to turbulence and irreversible mixing is necessary,
              | however, in order to improve the modeling of heat fluxes in the ocean on a global
              | scale. Oceanic mixing occurs at the scale of 10−2 − 100 m, much smaller than the
              | resolution of global and regional circulation models used for weather forecasting and
              | climate prediction (104 − 105 m). Therefore, the breaking and mixing that result from
              | internal wave interactions with bathymetry must be parameterized in order to capture
              | their effects in larger scale models.

text          | Specifically, this work addresses how certain simplified breaking and mixing param-
              | eterizations can fall short in modeling oceanic processes. For example, the steady
              | shear flow criterion is often used as an indicator of turbulence in the ocean. The sta-
              | bility of a parallel, steady, stratified shear flow is guaranteed when buoyancy forces
              | are sufficiently large relative to the shear, corresponding to the gradient Richardson
              | number criterion Rig ≥ 0.25. This criterion is applied widely in geophysical flows and
              | parameterizations, where it is often assumed that a flow is turbulent when Rig ≤ 0.25
              | and laminar otherwise. However, if Rig is less than 0.25, this is a necessary but not
              | sufficient criterion for instability. In addition, the assumptions of parallel, steady,
              | uniform flow are often violated for geophysical flows. Along with the results of Troy
              | & Koseff (2005b) and Barad & Fringer (2010), this study indicates how the effects
              | of unsteadiness and wave nonlinearity can alter the critical Richardson number for
              | wave instability. The validity of the assumption that a constant fraction of the energy
              | dissipated in stratified flows goes to irreversibly mixing the density gradients is also
              | addressed in this study. While a range of studies have established that the efficiency
              | with which turbulence mixes a stratified flow can vary significantly, more sophisticated
              | mixing parameterizations that reflect this inhomogeneous nature of oceanic flows are
              | not often implemented in larger scale models (e.g., Ivey et al., 2008). The results
              | in this study support the idea that a constant mixing efficiency does not accurately
              | represent the mixing resulting from breaking interfacial waves at a submerged ridge.
              |     While internal wave propagation and breaking can involve a host of different mech-
              | anisms, this study utilizes a simplified internal wave flow where periodic, progressive
              | waves in a two-layer stratification interact with a submerged, Gaussian ridge. Fig-
              | ure 1.1 illustrates the major aspects of the wave–ridge interaction considered in this
              | study. In the wave–ridge interaction, some wave energy may be reflected back from
              | the ridge, whereas some energy may be converted to higher harmonic waves. Un-
              | der some conditions, waves can break at the ridge, leading to dissipation of energy
              | as well as irreversible mixing. While laboratory experiments are subject to certain

              | vestigation of internal wave breaking. Although huge advantages have been made
              | in processing time for direct simulations of fluid flows, the use of direct numerical
              | simulations for studying stratified mixing remains somewhat limited due to the high
              | computational cost of resolving the full range of the scales of motion. While the
              | Reynolds number of laboratory experiments is still limited relative to oceanic flows,
              | higher resolution of mixing processes can be obtained using PIV and PLIF meth-
              | ods than in a comparably sized, 3D numerical simulation (e.g., Venayagamoorthy &
              | Fringer, 2006). To simulate oceanic mixing processes, both high spatial resolution as
              | well as realistic, interfacial wave forcing are necessary.
              |    Laboratory experiments on the interactions between monochromatic, periodic,
              | interfacial wave trains and a simplified bathymetric ridge are used to isolate and an-
              | alyze specific processes such as harmonic wave generation over the ridge, instability
              | mechanisms and turbulent mixing. Chapter 2 explores the excitement of freely prop-
              | agating, higher harmonic waves that can occur when periodic, interfacial waves pass
              | over a submerged ridge. Chapter 3 examines the conditions under which internal
              | wave break at the ridge. A qualitative classification system for breaking events is
              | presented, where the occurrence of breaking types is parameterized by length scales
              | of the waves, stratification, and topography. The applicability of breaking criteria
              | based on shear (Rig ) and wave non-linearity (a/h) are discussed for breaking events
              | where both shear and convective forcing are significant. Chapters 4 and 5 explore
              | from different perspectives the question of how efficient are these interfacial wave
              | breaking events at mixing density gradients. Chapter 4 considers the net event effi-
              | ciency using full-tank control volume experiments. In Chapter 5, on the other hand,
              | the spatial and temporal variation of mixing processes within internal wave breaking
              | events is investigated using high-resolution measurements of density and velocity. As
              | a whole, this study analyzes the breaking and energy transfer resulting from periodic,
              | interfacial waves interacting with rough bathymetry.

title         | 2.1      Introduction
text          | Internal waves have been observed in the ocean at a wide range of temporal scales.
              | Field observations in areas with rough bathymetry do not typically show the smooth
              | continuum of internal wave energy across frequency space suggested by Garrett &
              | Munk (1972). Instead, peaks of energy have been observed at the dominant tidal
              | frequencies as well as at higher harmonics of the tidal frequencies (Kunze et al.,
              | 2002; van Haren et al., 2002). Barotropic tides interacting with bathymetry can
              | transfer energy to internal tides (e.g., Dushaw et al., 1995; Holloway & Merrifield,
              | 1999; Althaus et al., 2003). How, then, is internal wave energy converted from internal
              | tides to higher frequency motions? It is well known that surface waves passing over
              | obstacles such as breakwaters and reefs can lead to the transfer of energy to higher
              | harmonic waves (e.g., Byrne, 1969; Rey et al., 1992; Beji & Battjes, 1993). Despite the
              | number of studies on this phenomenon reported in surface wave literature, as well as
              | studies on the excitement of harmonic frequencies in a continuously stratified water
              | column, this phenomenon has not been previously studied for periodic, interfacial
              | waves. In this study, observations indicate that harmonic wave generation can occur

title         | 2.2      Background
text          | In continuously stratified water, there are a number of wave-topography interactions
              | that can generate internal waves at harmonic frequencies. Bell (1975) showed that
              | oscillating, stratified flow over a ridge can excite harmonic wave rays that propagate
              | from the ridge. This mechanism for transferring barotropic, tidal energy to internal
              | waves has been investigated in the lab (Lee & Beardsley, 1974; Gostiaux & Dauxois,
              | 2007; Peacock et al., 2008) and in the ocean (e.g. Pingree & New, 1991; Azevedo
              | et al., 2006; Gerkema et al., 2004). Large amplitude internal solitary waves passing
              | over a ridge can lead to overturning and the generation of dispersive wave packets
              | (e.g. Sveen et al., 2002) as well as the generation of second mode waves along a finite
              | thickness interface (Hüttemann & Hutter, 2001). This study, however, appears to
              | be the first observation of harmonic waves generated by the interaction of periodic,
              | interfacial waves and bathymetry (figure 2.1).

              | process is of interest in the design of breakwaters, because the conversion of energy
              | from low frequency waves to higher frequency waves can reduce wave impacts at the
              | shoreline (Losada et al., 1997). Observations of surface waves suggest that the fraction
              | of wave energy transferred to higher harmonics increases with the nonlinearity of the
              | shoaling wave. Studies have noted that harmonic generation of surface waves tends

              | transfer to higher frequency components, phase-locked to the incident wave. As the
              | wave propagates over the obstacle, though, energy can be transferred between phase-
              | locked (or bound) components and free components that propagate independently
              | as higher frequency waves. Ohyama & Nadaoka (1994) state that the difference in

              | harmonic components as the waves pass over the obstacle. In the case of surface waves

              | and k2 is the wave number for free waves at 2ω1 . The amount of energy at 2ω1 that
              | propagates downstream of the step is set by the level of energy at the downstream
              | edge of the step. Thus the energy in the second harmonic is maximized when the step
              | length is equal to 0.5L2 (or 1.5L2 , 2.5L2 , ...). This formulation is based on weakly
              | non-linear theory, and the results of Ohyama and Nadaoka indicate that the beat
              | distance tends to decrease when incident waves are more non-linear. Brossard et al.
              | (2009) also hypothesize that the transfer of energy to higher harmonics is due to
              | the resonance of these higher components over the obstacle. Although these surface
              | wave results were obtained over a rectangular obstacle, this mechanism may influence
              | the transfer of energy to higher harmonic frequencies over the more gradual ridge
              | geometry in this study. The results of Rey et al. (1992) indicate that rounding the
              | corners of a rectangular step slightly alters the local generation of vortices, but does
              | not significantly impact the magnitude of energy transfer to higher harmonics. In

              | however, may have an impact on the reflection coefficient and harmonic generation

text          |      Linear and weakly non-linear models of surface waves can capture the dependence

              | Newman, 1965a,b; Miles, 1967; Mei & Black, 1969), but not the transfer of energy
              | to higher harmonics. Higher order Stokes-type methods have also been applied to

              | (Massel, 1983; Belibassakis & Athanassoulis, 2002). However, modeling the transfer of

              | a variable depth, fully non-linear model that can incorporate periodic wave forcing.

              | 100cm, a standard deviation of 25cm and a height of 20.2cm. At the far end of the
              | tank, waves are absorbed by a horsehair beach.
              |      The tank was stratified with salt (NaCl) to form two homogeneous layers sepa-
              | rated by a thin interface. The density difference between the two layers, (ρ1 − ρ2 )/ρ0 ,
              | was either 1% or 3%. The interface was sharpened so that 99% of the density vari-
              | ation occurred over the interfacial thickness δ = 1.5 ± 0.15cm at the start of each
              | experimental run. The lower layer depth, h1 , was varied between 24cm ≤ h1 ≤ 36cm,
              | and the total water depth was maintained at h1 + h2 = 56cm. The waves of a
              | range of amplitude were generated (0cm < a∞ < 3cm) at a range of frequencies,
              | 0.05πrad/s < ω1 < 0.8πrad/s.
              |      Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) was used to obtain images of the wave

              | scanning mirror mounted above the tank sweeps the beam of an Argon-ion laser
              | through the imaging area. Concurrently, a 12-bit, 1024 by 1024 pixel CCD camera
              | takes a photo of the illuminated dye. Interfacial height displacements were made by
              | fitting a tanh profile to vertical columns of the image pixel intensity. The interfacial
              | displacement corresponds to the height, z, where the argument of the tanh function

title         | 2.4.2       Wave speed
text          | One key question is “Are higher frequency waves bound to the main wave (i.e., phase-
              | locked) or do they propagate independently? ” Because the generated harmonic waves
              | are dispersive, the phase speed of components can be used to distinguish whether the
              | components are bound or free. Brossard et al. (2000) employed a moving probe tech-
              | nique to distinguish the Doppler-shifted spectral peaks of bound and free harmonic
              | components based on phase speed. To investigate the phase speed in this study, the
              | interfacial height signal is band-pass filtered about the frequency of interest to remove
              | higher and lower frequency fluctuations. Least squares regression is then used to fit
              | a linear curve to the downstream wave characteristic, following the path of an indi-
              | vidual wave crest in space and time. The mean slope of the curves fitted to different
              | wave characteristics downstream of the obstacle is taken to be the phase speed, cp , of
              | the wave.
              |    The wave amplitudes as well as the phase speeds of harmonic components cal-
              | culated using this characteristic method are shown in figure 2.4 for 5 cases. For the
              | components shown in figure 2.4(b) by (×), the signal to noise ratio was greater than 4
              | for the peak in the energy spectrum of the corresponding amplitude shown in 2.4(a).

text          |        If the higher frequency characteristics (2ω1 , 3ω1 , 4ω1 , ...) corresponded to com-
              | ponents that were phase-locked to the fundamental wave at ω1 , then these higher
              | frequency waves would travel at the same phase speed as the base wave, but this is
              | not the case here. Given the agreement between the free wave dispersion relation
              | and the measured phase speeds, it appears that the free components are larger than
              | any bound harmonic components. This is true for all higher harmonic frequencies
              | examined in this study. It is possible, however, that although most of energy in each
              | higher frequency is in the free wave component, a small percentage of the wave energy
              | may exist in bound components. In their surface wave study, Brossard et al. (2009)
              | found that upstream of the submerged obstacle, the bound or Stokes component at
              | 2ω1 was typically 1.5 − 4 times larger than the free component, whereas downstream
              | of the obstacle, the transmitted free component was typically 1.5 − 3 times larger
              | than the transmitted bound component, with the relative amplitudes varying with

text          | Unlike in the surface wave case, the stratification between the layers can inhibit the
              | generation of high frequency interfacial waves. In a stratified flow, the buoyancy
              | frequency, N, is the highest frequency at which waves can propagate away from the
              | point of generation. If a flow is perturbed at a frequency greater than N, the energy
              | will be dissipated locally. In figure 2.6, the energy in harmonic frequencies ω = nω1 is
              | shown as a fraction of the total wave energy for a range of experimental conditions. It
              | is clear that there is not significant wave energy in waves at harmonic frequencies that
              | exceed 40% of the maximum buoyancy frequency, Nmax , downstream of the ridge. No
              | higher harmonics at frequencies above ω/Nmax = 0.5 contain more than 0.1% of the
              | transmitted wave energy, with the exception of one breaking wave case. For this two-

              | 0.74 and Ivey et al. (2000) up to ω/N = 0.78. In experiments simulating tidal flow

              | excited at frequencies high as ω/N = 0.7. Recent numerical results for tidal flow

              | background N, but energy at frequencies above N did not propagate away from the
              | ridge as internal waves Korobov & Lamb (2008). The transition value of ω/N above

text          | compared in figure 2.7. In figure 2.7(a), there appears to be a cutoff value of Ur ≈ 10
              | above which harmonic generation occurs. This is consistent with observations of sur-
              | face wave bore formation above a critical value of Ur (e.g., Kundu & Cohen, 2004).
              | Above the critical value of Ur ≈ 10 in figure 2.7(a), harmonic generation tends to
              | increase, but in some cases, very low generation is observed for high Ur . In figure
              | 2.7(b), higher energy transfer to harmonics tends to occur for higher a∞ /hr , however,
              | there is much variation in the data.
              |    When 0.3 " a∞ /hr " 0.5, waves at the ridge become unstable and break with more
              | vigorous breaking as a∞ /hr increases (see Chapter 3). The transition to breaking may
              | occur for a wide range Ur , depending on the particular conditions, as shown in 2.7(a)
              | and 2.8(a). Although Ur ≈ 10 seems to provide a lower bound on when harmonic
              | generation occurs, Ur does not seem to be the best predictor of the breaking transition
              | or the magnitude of E2ω1 /ET otal .
              |    The relationship between E2ω1 /ET otal and the non-linearity parameter becomes
              | more clear when the data is separated by frequency, as shown in figure 2.8. For high
              | frequency cases, when ω1 /Nmax > 0.21, there is no substantial excitement of harmonic
              | frequencies due to the stratification (see figure 2.6), independent of a∞ /hr or Ur . For
              | intermediate frequencies, 0.06 < ω1 /Nmax < 0.21, the fraction of wave energy in
              | higher harmonics tends to increase with a∞ /hr and Ur , prior to wave breaking. In
              | figures 2.8(bii -iv ), the relationship between a∞ /hr and E2ω1 /ET otal is roughly linear
              | for non-breaking waves, but the rate of increase varies by frequency, ω1 /Nmax . In
              | figure 2.8(biii ), the maximum energy transfer to harmonic waves occurs at a∞ /hr ≈
              | 0.5 just beyond the breaking transition.
              |    As a∞ /hr increases towards limit where the wave amplitude approaches the lower
              | layer depth above the ridge, hr , the transfer of energy to harmonic waves tends to
              | decrease in cases where ω/Nmax > 0.1. This effect is illustrated in figure 2.9(b) and
              | 2.9(c). In figure 2.9(a), however, there is no observed decrease in harmonic excitement.
              | Two factors may contribute to the observed decline in harmonic excitement as the
              | amplitude, a∞ /hr , is increased for breaking wave cases. First, there are substantial

              | the ridge may alter the process that leads to harmonic excitement. For the surface
              | wave case, Beji & Battjes (1993) suggest that the wave breaking process is secondary
              | to the generation of harmonic waves as waves steepen in shallow water. Beji and
              | Battjes observed that the distribution of energy did not change substantially between
              | breaking and non-breaking waves. Accordingly, the spectra for near-breaking and
              | breaking wave cases are similar in this study (figure 2.5). In the limit where a∞ /hr
              | is large, the breaking behavior becomes more similar to the wave breaking events
              | in the simulations of Venayagamoorthy & Fringer (2007), with pulses of mixed fluid
              | periodically ejected over the ridge. In this limit, it is possible that the generation of
              | harmonics may be altered.
              |    Another factor contributing to the decline in harmonic excitement as breaking in-
              | tensifies may be the changing background stratification due to wave induced mixing.

              | sult, the effective ω/N may be sufficient to reduce harmonic excitement, as shown in
              | figure 2.6. Although this effect is enhanced by the finite size of the tank, periodic

text          | Both Ohyama & Nadaoka (1994) and Brossard et al. (2009) state that the ratio of the
              | obstacle length to a length scale of the waves impacts harmonic generation, although
              | different wave length scales are proposed. Ohyama & Nadaoka (1994) suggest that
              | the excitement of the harmonic frequency 2ω1 varies periodically with the ratio of the
              | obstacle length, D, to the beat length, L2 , as discussed in section 2.2. Similarly, the
              | higher harmonic 3ω1 is expected to vary periodically with a shorter spatial scale D/L3 ,
              | where L3 = 2π/(k3 − 3k1 ) (Ohyama & Nadaoka, 1994). Although their study focused
              | on waves propagating over flat obstacles, a similar modulation seems to occur over
              | the crest of a ridge in this two-layer study. The standard deviation of the Gaussian

              | peaks when σ/L2 = 0.3, with low excitement when σ/L2 = 0 and σ/L2 = 1. If

              | would be expected, when 1 " σ/L2 " 2, however, harmonic energy transfer is limited
              | by the stratification when σ/L2 > 0.8 for ω = 2ω1 and when σ/L2 > 0.2 for ω = 3ω1
              | for this case. Brossard et al. (2009) argue that the ratio of the obstacle length to
              | the bound harmonic wavelength (λ2,b = 2π/k2,b ) over the ridge, impacts harmonic
              | generation in the case of waves over a submerged plate. In that study, the maximum
              | harmonic transmission occurs for D/λ2,b between 0.7 and 1.05, and D/λ2,f between
              | 0.9 and 1.35, depending on the water depth over the plate. In figure 2.11(b) and (c),
              | the ratios σ/λ2,b and σ/λ2,f are shown and the results are consistent with the findings
              | of Brossard et al. (2009). Variation in the excitement of harmonic waves with the
              | ratios σ/L2 , σ/λ2,b and σ/λ2,f suggest that the scaled obstacle length may impact
              | this energy transfer, but further study is needed to determine which wave length scale
              | controls this process.

title         | 2.5      Discussion
text          | Although many of the processes observed in this study echo similar observations in
              | surface wave experiments, some notable differences exist. The suppression of higher
              | harmonics by the stratification in the two-layer case here is distinct, although not
              | surprising. Also, the peak in the fraction of harmonic energy observed near the tran-
              | sition to breaking has not been observed in surface water experiments, although the
              | transmission of higher harmonics under breaking surface wave conditions has received
              | limited attention (Beji & Battjes, 1993). Although the Ursell number has been re-
              | lated to harmonic generation in surface wave studies (e.g., Rey et al., 1992; Brossard
              | et al., 2009), this study suggests the parameter a∞ /hr is also useful. When breaking
              | and non-breaking waves are considered, figure 2.8 indicates that the parameter a∞ /hr
              | provides a more consistent measure of E2ω /ET otal than Ur , beyond the transition to

text          |      The fate of incident wave energy was investigated by comparing the interface dis-
              | placement on both sides of the ridge. The energy transmitted at various frequencies,
              | the energy associated with the breaking event, as well as the energy transferred to
              | viscous damping as a percentage of the upstream wave energy can be estimated by
              | comparing the interfacial displacement upstream of the ridge at xu = −64cm with
              | the signal downstream at xd = 85cm. Applying the theory developed by Troy &
              | Koseff (2006), the percentage of the upstream wave energy transferred to viscous
              | damping not associated with breaking, such as damping at the sidewalls, bottom,
              | interior and interface, is approximately 24% between xu and xd for this frequency.
              | Once the transmitted wave energy and non-breaking viscous damping are accounted
              | for, the remaining difference in wave energy between the xu and xd locations is as-
              | sumed to be associated with the wave breaking event, which includes both turbulent
              | kinetic energy dissipation and irreversible mixing. For a weak breaking event where
              | a∞ /hr = 0.5 and ω1 /Nmax = 0.14, 9% of the upstream wave energy is transmitted at
              | the harmonic frequency 2ω1 , whereas 14 ± 5% of the upstream wave energy is associ-
              | ated with the wave breaking event leading to turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and
              | irreversible mixing. As a∞ /hr is increased, harmonic excitement tends to decrease
              | while the energy transferred to dissipation and irreversible mixing in the breaking
              | event tends to increase. For the more vigorous breaking event where a∞ /hr = 0.85
              | shown in figure 2.10(b), 0.3% of the upstream wave energy is transmitted at 2ω1 , and
              | 44 ± 5% is associated with the breaking event.
              |      The experimental Reynolds number (Re ≈ 102 − 104 ) is lower than it would be
              | at oceanic scales (Re ≈ 105 − 107 ), so viscous damping of interfacial waves will be
              | more prominent in these experimental results. The rate of viscous decay increases
              | with frequency (Troy & Koseff, 2006), so higher frequency waves may be damped
              | significantly before reaching the downstream measurement location. The percentage
              | of energy lost to viscous damping is shown in figure 2.12 for non-breaking waves
              | between the ridge crest (x = 0cm) and the measurement location (x = 50cm). Over
              | the ridge crest, higher frequency components may make up a slightly larger fraction
              | of total wave energy than at the downstream location.

              | (a/hr , Ur ), obstacle versus wave length scales (σ/L2 ), and viscous wave dissipation.
              | Some of the variation in the strength of harmonic excitement could be explained
              | by more than one of these proposed factors. For example, figure 2.13 shows that
              | the decline in E2ω1 /ET otal as σ/L2 approaches 1 coincides with the proposed limit
              | of (ω/Nmax ≈ 0.4). Because of the correlation between 2ω1 /Nmax and σ/L2 for the
              | conditions explored in this study, it is not obvious whether the stratification or the
              | length scale ratio is limiting harmonic generation. To examine the dependence of
              | transmitted harmonics on σ/L2 independently of the stratification limit, one could
              | vary the obstacle length for a fixed wavelength and frequency. Because all the gener-
              | ation of all higher harmonics is limited when ω/Nmax ! 0.4, there is more evidence
              | in this study to support the stratification limit than the modulation based on σ/L2 ,
              | but both factors may be important.
              |      In this study, hydraulic control is not thought to be important in the generation of
              | harmonic waves. If steady, two-layer hydraulic theory is used calculate a composite
              |                                                      √

              | measurements for u1 and u2 were used to show that G < 1 at all times in all non-
              | breaking wave cases (see Hult et al., 2009). Because G < 1 everywhere, there is not a
              | control point over the ridge, and thus internal hydraulic control is not integral to the
              | generation of these harmonic waves. Although the steady theory is not appropriate
              | for hydraulic control due to the interaction of waves of similar time scales, it is not
              | thought that hydraulic control is a plausible explanation for wave generation here.
              | There are cases when low frequency internal or baroclinic motions over topography
              | can excite higher frequency waves (e.g., Apel et al., 1985), but in this study the
              | phasing of wave generation (see figure 2.2) and estimated Froude numbers are not
              | consistent with this mechanism.

              | nents that are phase-locked to the main wave. The measured phase speed of higher
              | frequency free components is consistent with the two-layer dispersion relation. The
              | generation of harmonic waves over the ridge is limited by the stratification when
              | the harmonic frequency exceeds approximately 40 to 50% of the maximum buoyancy
              | frequency. Below this stratification limit, higher harmonics at up to 10 times the in-
              | cident wave frequency were observed, and the energy in higher harmonic components
              | tends to decrease with the frequency. Energy transfer to harmonic waves may also
              | be modulated by the length of the topographic ridge relative to the length scale of
              | the wave.
              |    Harmonic generation is observed in cases when ω/Nmax < 0.5 and when Ur > 10.
              | The fraction of wave energy in higher frequency components increases with the non-
              | linearity of the incident wave, as quantified by a∞ /hr and Ur . Although harmonic
              | waves can be excited in breaking and non-breaking cases, the energy transfer is
              | maximized at or just beyond the critical amplitude where wave breaking occurs
              | (0.4 " a∞ /hr " 0.6). Beyond this amplitude, harmonic wave generation tends to
              | decrease. Interactions between periodic wave trains and a ridge can lead to as much
              | as 40% of the transmitted wave energy propagating as higher harmonic waves.

blank         | 
text          | Internal wave breaking is thought to be a major cause of vertical mixing in the
              | ocean. Despite the importance of this process, breaking events are very difficult to
              | observe in the field and the physical processes leading to the mixing are not completely
              | understood. The question of whether shear or convective instability leads to the
              | breaking of oceanic internal waves has lead to substantial debate. The nature of the
              | instability is important, not simply as an academic exercise, but because the mixing
              | efficiency can vary significantly depending on the type of instability. The accuracy of
              | this internal wave breaking efficiency is crucial for parameterizing these processes in
              | global ocean models. The mixing efficiency of a purely convective instability has been
              | shown to be 0.5 (Linden & Redondo, 1991) whereas the efficiency of shear instability
              | measured in a range of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations tends to
              | be about 0.2 (Peltier & Caulfield, 2003). Although a constant efficiency for internal
              | wave breaking is often assumed for model parameterization, breaking mechanisms can
              | vary significantly under different conditions. This chapter examines when and how
              | periodic, interfacial waves break when they interact with a ridge. Elevated turbulent

text          | diffusivities have been observed over rough bathymetry, suggesting that substantial
              | diapycnal mixing may occur at submerged ridges and sea mounts due to internal
              | wave breaking (Toole et al., 1997; Polzin et al., 1997; Lueck & Mudge, 1997; Ledwell
              | et al., 2000). The two main goals of this chapter are (i) to use incident wave and
              | topographic scales to classify when and how interfacial waves break at a ridge, and
              | (ii) to investigate whether the local gradient Richardson number is a good predictor
              | of breaking in these wave events. These goals are investigated through laboratory
              | experiments, using the spatially and temporally resolved methods of planar laser
              | induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV).
              |      The layout of this chapter is as follows. In section 3.2, background information on
              | the breaking of internal waves at bathymetry is provided. The methods and facility
              | are described in section 3.3. In section 3.4, the results on wave breaking are presented
              | and in section 3.5 these results are discussed and compared with a simple theoretical
              | model. Conclusions are presented in section 3.6.

              | Orlanski and Bryan (1969) argue that overturning driven by gravitational instability
              | will always occur when the local fluid velocity, u, exceeds the phase speed of the wave,
              | cp , hence the local F r > 1 and suggest that in a linear stratification, instability due
              | to shear should require four times the energy required for convective instability, and
              | thus convective instability is likely to dominate internal wave breaking.
              |    Recent work (Troy & Koseff, 2005b; Fructus et al., 2009), however, has pointed out
              | the shortcomings of the application of steady, uniform instability criteria to breaking
              | internal waves; the extreme unsteadiness and non-uniformity of the flow field renders
              | the gradient Richardson number and Froude number (u/cp ) insufficient predictors of
              | instability.
              |    Recent field observations show dramatic qualitative evidence of shear instability in
              | the breaking of internal solitary waves of depression over the continental shelf (Moum
              | et al., 2003). Grue et al. (2000) observe structures suggestive of shear instability but
              | suggest that generally, waves observed tend to break when u/cp > 1. De Silva et al.
              | (1996) compare the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz billows observed in the lab
              | with field observations of turbulence in internal solitary waves and find similar billow
              | growth rates, suggesting overturning observed in the field may be due to shear insta-
              | bility. For periodic, long interfacial waves, Troy & Koseff (2005b) observe breaking
              | due to shear instability at the crests and troughs of progressive waves in the labo-
              | ratory. In numerical simulations, Fringer & Street (2003) observe shear instability
              | leading to convective instability and weak convective instability for intermediate and
              | shorter waves respectively. The breaking of internal waves along topographic slopes
              | has also been investigated (Thorpe, 1987; Ivey & Nokes, 1989; Taylor, 1993).

text          | A number of studies have examined the process of internal waves shoaling and break-
              | ing on bathymetric features such as slopes, shelves and ridges. When first mode,
              | periodic waves in a continuous stratification interact with a slope, intense mixing
              | occurs near the bed for waves of critical slope (Cacchione & Wunsch, 1974; Ivey &

text          | Nokes, 1989; Ivey et al., 2000). Field observations of shoaling internal waves have
              | captured a range of breaking events, including dense water boluses advected up-slope
              | (Emery & Gunnerson, 1973). Similar boluses were observed in laboratory experi-
              | ments after gravitational instability developed in two-layer, progressive wave train
              | interactions with a shoaling shelf (Wallace & Wilkinson, 1988) and in the numerical
              | simulations of first mode waves in a continuous stratification (Venayagamoorthy &
              | Fringer, 2006).
              |      Laboratory and numerical studies on internal wave interactions with topography
              | suggest that breaking through shear instability may occur, but as the nonlinearity
              | of the event is increased, more vigorous mixed or convective breaking dominates. In
              | laboratory experiments, internal solitary waves of depression shoaling on a uniform
              | slope became unstable through shear instability on the rear face of the wave (Kao
              | et al., 1985) and through mixed or convective overturning in more intense interactions
              | (Helfrich & Melville, 1986). Strong, down slope flow from previous breaking waves
              | can intensify the breaking of incident shoaling waves (Wallace & Wilkinson, 1988;
              | Helfrich & Melville, 1986; Vlasenko & Hutter, 2002; Sveen et al., 2002). Sveen et al.
              | observed convective breaking in lab experiments on internal solitary wave interactions
              | with a ridge, with shear instability also observed during the strongest wave-ridge
              | interactions. Shear instability, preceding convective instability, during very strong
              | wave-slope interactions was observed by Boegman et al. (2005).
              |      While many studies have looked at wave interactions with a slope or shelf, limited

              | ridge can be somewhat different than the slope and shelf cases. When the interface
              | intersects the slope of the ridge, wave breaking would likely be very similar to the slope
              | case. When the ridge crest is below the density interface, however, wave breaking is
              | no longer focused along the slope and additional parameters, such as the height of
              | the interface over the ridge, may impact wave breaking. In the ridge case, waves
              | tend to shoal as they approach the ridge, and then become less steep as they pass
              | beyond the ridge, complicating the breaking dynamics. The present study investigates
              | wave interactions with similar bathymetry to Sveen et al., but focuses on periodic,

blank         | 
text          | A variety of breaking criteria have been developed for predicting when interfacial
              | waves will break. A theoretical estimate for the critical wave steepness, ka, for wave
              | instability can be determined for interfacial waves with a finite interfacial thickness
              | (Thorpe, 1978) and for an infinitely thin interface (Holyer, 1979). Both the wave
              | steepness, ka, and u/cp are measures of wave non-linearity and are sometimes used
              | to assess whether convective instability will develop in surface and interfacial waves.
              | The minimum value of Rig and the maximum value of u/cp are commonly used
              | as indicators of instability, but these metrics must be known over the spatial and
              | temporal extent of the event. Because these dynamic metrics may be very costly to
              | measure, the ideal predictive breaking criteria would be based on incident wave and
              | topographic length scales.
              |    Many studies have used scales of the wave and topography to describe when
              | interfacial wave breaking occurs, often following the parameterization of surface wave
              | breaking. These parameterizations aim to provide some predictive capability for
              | wave breaking and are typically based on quantities such as length scales that are
              | easier to measure than Rig (x, y, z, t) or u(x, y, z, t)/cp. Shoaling surface waves become
              | unstable when the amplitude scaled by the local depth reaches the constant value of
              | a/h = 0.39, with this ratio increasing significantly when the beach slope is greater
              | than 1/40 (e.g., Dean & Dalrymple, 1984). For a slope-shelf geometry, Helfrich &
              | Melville (1986) apply a similar criterion for interfacial waves and show that solitary
              | waves propagate up-slope without instability when a0 /h1 " 0.3, where a0 is the
              | amplitude of the solitary wave and h1 is the local depth of the lower layer. Weak
              | interfacial shear instabilities occurred for 0.3 < a/h1 < 0.4, with strong convective
              | overturning when a/h1 ! 0.4. For solitary waves shoaling on a uniform slope without
              | a shelf present, similar results are obtained, with breaking occurring for a/h1 ! 0.3
              | (Helfrich 1992). Vlasenko and Hutter (2002) suggest a bed slope-dependent breaking
              | criterion for solitary waves on slope-shelf bathymetry where a/h1 = 0.8◦ /γ + 0.4,

text          | where γ is the angle of the slope from the horizontal direction, based on quasi-two
              | layer numerical simulations. Wave slope and bed slope have been shown to affect
              | internal solitary wave breaking on a slope as well (Nagashima, 1971; Michallet &
              | Ivey, 1999), and an internal Irribarren number comparing the wave steepness and
              | the bed slope has been used to distinguish the regimes when spilling, plunging, and
              | collapsing breaking of solitary waves occur (Boegman et al., 2005).
              |      While the parallel, steady, inviscid shear flow stability criterion of Rig ≥ 0.25 has
              | often been applied to internal wave flows, there is some question as to whether the as-
              | sumptions of parallel, steady shear flow are valid. Furthermore, although Rig ≤ 0.25
              | is a necessary but insufficient condition for shear instability in a steady, parallel invis-
              | cid flow, a wide range of ocean models assume turbulence occurs wherever Rig falls
              | below 0.25. The validity of the steady and uniform assumptions depend on how the
              | unsteadiness time scale, λ/cp compares with the time scale of instability growth and
              | how the wavelength, λ compares with the spatial scale of the instability (e.g., Kao
              | et al., 1985; Troy & Koseff, 2005b). In a recent review paper, Helfrich & Melville
              | (2006) state that neither field observations nor lab experiments that have suggested
              | that interfacial waves may break through shear instability have had sufficient resolu-
              | tion to determine the local Richardson number. To verify whether the shear stability
              | criterion is appropriate, the spatial and temporal resolution of density and velocity
              | measurements must be sufficient to capture the local minimum in Rig .
              |      Several methods have been used to measure Rig directly. Kao et al. (1985) es-
              | timated Rig in a shoaling solitary wave by measuring the displacement of a column
              | of hydrogen bubbles to estimate the shear profile and found the minimum Rig to be
              | near or below 0.25 for unstable cases, which was consistent with their KdV model
              | results. Fructus et al. (2009) measured the velocity in internal solitary waves and
              | paired that with a theoretical density field for the observed wave parameters so that
              | Rig could be calculated. While this is an elegant solution for idealized conditions, the
              | theoretical density field cannot be calculated for the complex bathymetric interaction
              | in the wave-ridge case. Dalziel et al. (2007) have developed a system to obtain 2D,
              | simultaneous density and velocity measurements using synthetic schlieren and PIV,
              | stressing the need for simultaneous measurements in order to capture key dynamics

text          | The wave-ridge interaction of this study is controlled by 11 dimensional parameters:
              | layer depths h1 and h2 , the height of the ridge h0 , the standard deviation of the
              | Gaussian ridge σ, the height of the interface above the ridge hr , the wave amplitude
              | a, the wavenumber k, the interfacial thickness δ, the viscosity ν, the diffusivity of the
              | stratifying scalar κ, and the reduced gravity g # = 2g(ρ1 − ρ2 )/(ρ1 + ρ2 )), where the
              | length scales are shown in figure 3.1(c). From these 11 parameters, 9 dimensionless
              | groups can be formed, including a Reynolds number Re = a2 (g # /δ)1/2 /ν, a Schmidt
              | number Sc = ν/κ and 7 length scale ratios: the wave steepness ka, scaled wavenum-
              | bers kδ and kσ, scaled layer depths kh1 and kh2 , ridge slope h0 /2σ, and a scaled
              | amplitude a/hr .
              |    In this study, the most important parameters are thought to be the scaled am-
              | plitude a/hr , the scaled wavelength kδ and the wave steepness ka. These three
              | parameters as well as a Richardson number which can be estimated from the other
              | dimensionless parameters (see section 3.5.1) are used to study the role of shear and
              | non-linearity in wave breaking at the ridge. The ridge slope may affect breaking be-
              | havior (e.g., Vlasenko & Hutter, 2002), but this parameter is not varied in this study.
              | Here, h0 /2σ = 0.4, which is comparable to bathymetric slopes of 0.07 to 0.5 where
              | enhanced diapycnal diffusivities have been observed (Kunze & Sanford, 1996; Toole
              | et al., 1997). The parameter kσ is varied, but this parameter is not thought to have
              | a major impact on the flow except perhaps in the knife-edge limit, when the flow is
              | very long relative to the ridge (kσ < 1). Low values of h0 /2σ and kσ are limited
              | by the length of the lab facility. The Reynolds number may impact when separation
              | over the ridge occurs (see section 3.4.5). The Schmidt number is held constant.

text          | Experiments were conducted in a tank 30cm wide, 60cm tall, 488cm long using a semi-
              | cylindrical wave maker at one end to generate interfacial waves. Trains of progressive,
              | interfacial waves were forced over a Gaussian ridge with a standard deviation of
              | σ = 25cm, and with height h0 = 20cm (see figure 3.1(a)). The stratification is two-
              | layer where h1∞ and h2 are the lower and upper layer thicknesses. The interfacial
              | thickness was δ = 1.5 ± 0.1cm at the start of each experiment. A conductivity-
              | temperature probe mounted on a vertical traverse is used to obtain density profiles
              | to verify the initial stratification. The total water depth, h1∞ + h2 , was kept constant
              | at 56cm, while the height of the interface above the ridge, hr , was varied between
              | 3 and 10cm by adjusting h1∞ . The density difference between the two layers was
              | varied from ∆ρ/ρ0 = 2(ρ1 − ρ2 )/(ρ1 + ρ2 ) = 1% to 9%. The tank was stratified using

text          | Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) has been used in a wide range of flows to
              | measure scalar concentration fields (Crimaldi, 2008). In these experiments, a laser
              | fluorescent dye (Rhodamine 6G) is added to the lower layer at a concentration of
              | 50-80ppb. The dye in a portion of the x − z plane is illuminated using the scanning
              | mirror and Argon-ion laser (figure 3.1(a)). Rhodamine 6G and salt have similar
              | Schmidt numbers, Sc = ν/κ, 600-1200 and 700 respectively, and thus are expected
              | to diffuse similarly (Rehmann 1996). Image pixel intensity can be converted to dye
              | concentration and subsequently to density after appropriate calibration and correction
              | (Crimaldi & Koseff, 2001; Troy & Koseff, 2005a). Images were taken at 7.5 or 15Hz
              | using a 1024 by 1024 pixel, 12-bit gray scale CCD camera (Silicon Mountain Designs),
              | to give a typical spatial resolution of 0.2mm (approximately the thickness of the light
              | sheet).
              |      The interfacial height was determined by fitting a tanh function to the intensity
              | of each image column where the midpoint of the tanh profile is taken to be the
              | interfacial height. This method effectively provides a wave gage for locations visible

              |    Simultaneous measurements of velocity and density were obtained using PIV and
              | PLIF systems with a single laser, scanning mirror, and two cameras (Variano &
              | Cowen, 2008). During the first sweep of the laser, a PIV image was obtained. During
              | the second sweep, a PIV image and a PLIF image were taken simultaneously. Typi-
              | cally, the two PIV images were separated by 3-20ms, depending on the flow velocity,
              | the three-dimensionality of the flow, and the size of the field of view. Band-pass op-
              | tical filters were used to allow the PIV camera to image the particles while blocking
              | the signal from the dye and to allow the PLIF camera to image the dye field while
              | excluding emissions from the particles. Simultaneous PIV/PLIF systems have been
              | used in density-stratified flows to study the dynamics and entrainment of buoyant
              | plumes (Law et al., 2003; Diez et al., 2005; Ai et al., 2006). When strong density gra-
              | dients are present in the flow, there are some challenges to implementing PIV/PLIF.
              | Two salt stratified layers will have different indices of refraction, which causes light
              | to be distorted as it passes through density gradients in the fluid. This phenomenon
              | can distort the appearance of the interface and can severely cloud particle and dye
              | images of turbulent flows. In order to use PIV/PLIF in stratified flows, the index
              | of refraction can be matched between the two layers by using a dilute solution of
              | isopropyl alcohol in the upper layer and a salt solution in the lower layer (Daviero
              | et al., 2001). For a density difference of ∆ρ/ρ0 = 1% between the layers, the index
              | of refraction of both layers is n = 1.3346.

text          | The results from two sets of experiments are discussed in this section. In the first
              | set of experiments, a qualitative breaking classification is developed for wave-ridge
              | breaking events (section 3.4.1), and scales of the topography and the incident wave
              | are used to parameterize when breaking occurs (section 3.4.2). The second set of
              | experiments narrows the focus to look just at waves on the threshold of instability.
              | The amplitude of the incident wave is adjusted to find the lowest amplitude for which
              | overturning is observed at the interface. Using simultaneous measurements of velocity

text          | and density, section 3.4.4 examines whether the gradient Richardson number is a good
              | indicator of when this onset of instability occurs.
              |      The amplitude, a, is measured from fluctuations of the interfacial height in PLIF
              | images. The wavenumber, k, is computed from the two-layer dispersion relation,
              | equation 3.2, for a given forcing frequency of the wave maker, ω. The subscript, ∞,
              | indicates the quantity is measured or calculated just upstream of the ridge. Where
              | k, a, and h1 appear without subscripts, the quantities are evaluated over the ridge
              | crest.
              |      As waves propagate up the ridge into more shallow water, the wave steepness, ka,
              | tends to increase if wave energy is conserved. As the depth decreases, flow in the
              | lower layer is constricted to a smaller vertical extent, so the magnitude of the velocity
              | in the lower layer increases. Through some combination of increased wave steepness
              | (i.e., increased velocity relative to the wave speed) and increased shear across the
              | interface, waves can become unstable and break, leading to mixing. The mechanism
              | for instability in an interfacial wave-ridge interaction is the focus of this study.

text          | In the breaking classification experiments, a range of waves were generated by varying
              | the wavelength (λ∞ = 25−300cm), amplitude (a∞ = 0.5−6cm) and the height of the
              | interface over the ridge (hr = 3 − 10cm), to vary dimensionless parameters ka, kδ and
              | a/hr . For the same values of ka, kδ and a/hr , the Reynolds number was varied by a
              | factor of 3 by changing the density difference between the layers (∆ρ/ρ0 = 1, 3, 9%).
              |      Three primary types of breaking events were observed: backward breaking, for-
              | ward plunging breaking, and forward Kelvin-Helmholtz breaking, and examples of
              | each breaking type are shown in figure 3.2. If no visible overturning was observed,
              | waves were classified as not breaking. Backward breaking involves a counter-clockwise,
              | shear instability in the lee of the wave crest as the wave passes over the crest of the
              | ridge. Forward plunging breaking is characterized by a steepening of the front wave

title         | 3.4.2    Parameterization of breaking types
text          | The breaking mechanism can be predicted, to a degree, using scales of the incident
              | wave and topography. The relevant scales are the incident wave amplitude (a∞ ),
              | the length scale of the wave (k∞
              |                                −1
              |                                   ), the height of the interface above the ridge crest
              | (hr ) and the interface thickness (δ). Figure 3.5 shows that the breaking regimes
              | can be parameterized by the scaled amplitude, a∞ /hr , and the scaled wavelength,
              | k∞ δ. The breaking transition curve (solid) and the breaking type curves (dotted)
              | are fit to minimize the root-mean-square distance of points on the wrong side of each
              | curve. The solid curve provides an empirical breaking criterion defined by a∞ /hr
              | and k∞ δ for the range of parameters tested. In the limit of very long or very short
              | waves, or when the topography is exceedingly steep, this breaking criterion may
              | not hold. Dotted lines are intended to suggest regions where a given breaking type
              | tends to occur. For a constant value of k∞ δ, as the amplitude, a∞ /hr , was increased
              | waves tended to first break backward, then forward. Waves may be unstable to
              | backward breaking while stable to forward breaking due to the effects of interfacial
              | shear. This is because as a wave shoals, the increasing interfacial shear at the crest
              | is opposed by the steepening of the wave face. When the wave reaches the crest of
              | the ridge, however, wave steepening ceases and the interfacial shear can cause the
              | wave to become unstable. Forward Kelvin-Helmholtz breaking tended to occur when
              | a∞ /hr was high and the scaled wavenumber was low, i.e. when waves were steep
              | and long relative to the interface thickness. For very short waves (k∞ δ > 0.3), wave
              | breaking was observed, but the specific breaking mechanisms seemed to be heavily
              | dependent on perturbations from previous wave-ridge interactions and events were
              | not very repeatable. The results of this parameterization do not vary significantly
              | when the Reynolds number was increased by a factor of 3 from Re = 200 − 7000 to
              | Re = 600 − 20, 000 for the same values of a∞ /hr and k∞ δ.

text          | is a concern, in a laboratory flow of finite width, that sidewall effects may have a
              | significant effect on the transition to turbulence. A casual schlieren imaging set-
              | up shown in figure 3.6 was used to investigate the impact of the sidewalls on wave
              | breaking. A bright light and a camera were mounted several feet directly above
              | the region of interest, and white contact paper was applied to the ridge. For these
              | experiments, the index of refraction is not matched between the two layers so that
              | the distortion of light rays passing through sharp density gradients is projected onto
              | the white surface.

text          |    The schlieren images shown in figure 3.7 were obtained under the same wave
              | conditions as the Kelvin-Helmholtz forward breaking event in figure 3.2(c). The
              | vertical lines in the first image (t/T = 0.00) are associated with the initial overturning
              | in the event. The effect of the sidewalls appears here to be confined to within about
              | 5cm of the walls, and the interior portion of the flow is essentially uniform in the
              | cross-tank direction. As the breaking event develops, the three dimensional features
              | of the flow are quite regular in the second and third frames shown, and do not appear
              | to be triggered by side wall turbulence. Results from other breaking types showed
              | similar sidewall effects in the initial wave instability process.

title         | 3.4.4     Shear instability criterion
blank         | 
text          | This section takes a closer look at the flow conditions in waves at the threshold of
              | initial instability. The key questions are What is the mechanism that initially leads
              | to instability as the wave steepness is increased? and Is there a dynamic criterion
              | to predict when this instability occurs in the wave-ridge case? To investigate the
              | utility of the Rig > 0.25 stability criteria for this case of interfacial waves breaking
              | at a ridge, simultaneous PIV/PLIF was used to determine the minimum value of
              | Rig that occurs at the onset of wave instability. Waves of varied wavenumber, k∞ ,
              | were forced over the ridge and the wave amplitude was increased until overturning
              | was observed (see Table 3.1). For all Rig experiments, hr = 5cm and ∆ρ/ρ0 = 1%.
              | Each experimental run contained 5 consecutive, periodic waves of constant amplitude.
              | Between experimental runs, the two-layer stratification was sharpened.
              |    Figure 3.8 shows the evolution of the interface for several waves events at the
              | threshold of instability with varied wavelength. The contours of the mean density
              | (ρ = 999.7kg/m3) illustrate fluctuations of the density interface as a wave passes
              | over the ridge crest. As t/T increases, first the trough of the wave passes over the
              | ridge at t/T ≈ 0.4, followed by the crest of the wave at t/T ≈ 0.6 − 0.8. The
              | breaking events shown in figure 3.8(c), 3.8(d) and 3.8(e), are qualitatively similar to
              | the event shown in figure 3.2(a). In these events, the wave steepens as it passes over
              | the ridge crest and then overturns backwards in the lee of the wave crest. In figures
              | 3.8(a) and 3.8(b), when the waves are long relative to the interface thickness and the
              | ridge, (k∞ δ < 0.06), incipient overturning is observed for much less steep waves. For
              | these two cases, flow separation at the bed may provide an alternative mechanism
              | contributing to initial instability and this mechanism is discussed in section 3.4.5.

text          | the stratifying scalar, and thus we are interested in whether there is a critical value
              | for Rig within the interfacial region for instability. The interfacial region is defined
              | here based on distance from the mean density value contour. Away from the density
              | interface, noise in the density measurements tends to dominate the calculated values
              | of Rig . White patches below the interface in figure 3.9 are due to dye irregularities in
              | the lower layer which cause non-physical, negative values of Rig . The thickness of the
              | region about the mid-density contour was chosen to be as large as possible without
              | including the regions above and below the density interface, where noise dominates the
              | measured density gradients. For these experiments, the interfacial region is defined
              | to be 3mm below to 5mm above the mean density contour, which typically contains
              | 80% of the density variation. The sensitivity of the results to this definition was less
              | than measurement uncertainty (Rig ±0.1 within the interface, Rig ±1−10 elsewhere).
              |       The profiles shown in figure 3.9(a) show that the magnitude of the stratification,

              | shear, (du/dz)2 , varies significantly, with peak values at the wave crest (figure 3.9(a),
              | image (iv)) and trough (figure 3.9(a), image (ii)). These observations are typical
              | of the shoaling waves observed. In figure 3.9(b), patches of low Rig occur in the

              | above the ridge crest as the trough and then the crest of the wave pass by. For all
              | wavelengths, two local minima in Rig are present: during the trough and crest of
              | the wave when shear across the interface is highest. The minimum of Rig during
              | the trough typically persists longer, although overturning occurred as the crest of the
              | wave passed the ridge.
              |       The minimum value of Rig within the density interface is plotted in figure 3.11

text          | figure 3.11 are typically smaller than the minimum value over the wave period shown
              | in 3.10, where Rig,min (t/T ) is averaged over 5 wave events of equivalent a∞ /hr . There
              | is a discrepancy between local and phase averaged data because the minimum value
              | of Rig during the wave period does not always occur at precisely the same phase of
              | the wave. Taking the minimum value in a noisy data set will likely bias the resulting
              | critical value to be too low, but within the uncertainty indicated.
              |      At first glance, figure 3.11 suggests Rig,min = 0.25 provides a reasonably good
              | cutoff for when interfacial waves first become unstable. However, the minimum values
              | of Rig shown in figure 3.11 do not always occur during the crest of the wave, where
              | overturning is observed. Because the ridge acts to vertically constrain flow in the
              | lower layer to a greater extent while the trough passes than when the crest passes,
              | the minimum Rig is expected to occur during the trough. If shear alone causes the
              | instability, we would expect the instability to develop in the trough of the wave. Since
              | overturning is observed at the crest of the wave, shear must not be the only factor,
              | suggesting convective acceleration may also play a role in the wave instability.
              |      Both shear and convection appear to contribute to initial instability at the wave
              | crest, as the wave steepness is increased. The wave amplitude scaled by the minimum
              | lower layer depth over the ridge, a/hr , provides a measure of the wave non-linearity,
              | and in the limit of highly non-linear shoaling waves when a/hr is large, convective
              | instability is expected. Figure 3.12 indicates that while low Rig is often present for
              | waves at the onset of instability, high scaled amplitude, a/hr , is also present. Note, in
              | figure 3.12, a is the local amplitude over the ridge crest. The results in figure 3.12 the
              | critical value of Rig for breaking is sensitive to the local wave nonlinearity, a/hr . The
              | results of Troy & Koseff (2005b) indicate that in the absence of a shoaling slope, the
              | breaking transition occurs at Rig ≈ 0.1, for waves of comparable k∞ δ and a∞ /hr that
              | were forced to break in a channel contraction. The results of Barad & Fringer (2010)
              | suggest that breaking in internal solitary waves first occurs when Rig ≈ 0.1, as well.
              | In this study, the wave non-linearity, a/hr is increased, and this seems to increase the
              | critical Rig from 0.1. When a/hr > 0.4, the steady, parallel, shear stability criterion
              | of Rig > 0.25 clearly does not hold. This supports the notion that the instability is
              | initiated by a combination of shear and convection in these wave-ridge interactions.

              |      For waves shorter relative to the topography (higher k∞ δ), the critical waves are
              | steeper, thus the interaction with the ridge is more non-linear. The assumptions of

              | less appropriate as k∞ δ increases. Figure 3.13 shows a measure of non-linearity: the

              | the wave over the ridge, c = ω/k. Note that while u/cmax is relatively constant for the
              | range of k∞ δ tested, the vertical velocity, w/cmax , varies with k∞ δ for near-breaking
              | waves. For k∞ δ > 0.2, w/cmax is of the same magnitude as u/cmax . Larger convective
              | accelerations for k∞ δ = 0.20 may lead to overturning at slightly higher values of Rig
              | in figure 3.11, following from the results of Fringer & Street (2003) which found that

title         | 3.4.5       Separation of wave-induced boundary layer
text          | When the wavelength is long relative to the ridge (k∞ δ " 0.06), an alternative mech-
              | anism may lead to instability of the interface. When the scaled amplitude, a∞ /hr ,
              | is increased, the first instance of overturning at the interface may be caused by sep-
              | aration of the wave flow over the ridge. This phenomenon of separation at the bed
              | under a passing internal wave has been observed in numerical simulations (Diamessis
              | & Redekopp, 2006) and in experiments in the laboratory (Carr & Davies, 2006; Carr
              | et al., 2008). Thorpe (1998) proposed a separation vortex would develop beneath a
              | shoaling internal solitary wave, and such vortices have been observed in the ocean

text          | (Bogucki et al., 1997) and in the lab (Thorpe, 1998). As the trough of the wave
              | passes over the ridge, strong flow to the left in the lower layer tends to detach from
              | the ridge and a separation vortex is formed just upstream of the ridge crest. Instan-
              | taneous streamlines in figure 3.14(a), images (i) and (ii) show the development of
              | this separation vortex. As the crest of the wave passes the ridge, the vortex is lifted
              | from the bed and is advected downstream in images (iii) and (iv), unlike in previous
              | solitary wave studies such as Boegman & Ivey (2009). This vortex coincides with
              | an interfacial disturbance which eventually overturns. This lifted vortex may help to
              | explain why the wave crest becomes unstable when Rig > 0.25, as shown in figures
              | 3.10(a) and 3.10(b). When the wavelength is shorter relative to the topography, i.e.
              | k∞ σ ! 1, this separation vortex is not observed, as shown in figure 3.14(b). Note, the
              | streamlines in figure 3.14 are instantaneous and in a highly unsteady flow such as this,
              | particles in the flow will not follow streamlines. In this complex wave-bathymetric
              | interaction, it is difficult to tease out exactly the contributions of each type of in-
              | stability observed. As the wave amplitude is increased, the wave breaking intensifies
              | and it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish the role of separation at the bed
              | and instability at the interface. Figure 3.15 shows the velocity field during a plunging
              | wave event, with vortices developing in the lower layer.

text          |      Diamessis & Redekopp (2006) argue that if the Reynolds number and amplitude
              | are sufficiently large and an adverse pressure gradient is applied over a long enough
              | time, the separation bubble under the wave can become unstable and then periodically
              | eject vortices into the water column. In this study, no vortices were observed to be
              | ejected from the separation bubble, but in the long wave limit, this may be possible.
              | Unlike previous solitary wave studies, though, the separation vortex itself appears
              | to be lifted into the water column here. Both the coherence of the lifted separation
              | vortex observed in this study and the tendency for separation bubbles to eject vortices
              | are sensitive to Re. Therefore, the impact of such vortices on interfacial stability will
              | depend on Re. While this bed separation may not lead directly to the instability of
              | the wave face, the vortex may enhance resuspension of bed sediments under the wave,
              | as suggested by Diamessis & Redekopp (2006); Boegman & Ivey (2009).

text          | It is clear that interfacial shear plays an important role in the wave breaking events
              | in this study. Although an Rig criterion is arguably an insufficient tool to assess
              | stability in an unsteady, non-linear flow such as this, it is commonly applied to internal
              | wave flows and mixing parameterizations in stratified flows. The shear instability
              | metric, Rig , can be very difficult to measure, however, even under idealized laboratory
              | conditions. In section 3.5.1, a simple model is presented to estimate the expected
              | Rig using only the wave parameters and topography. The model is compared with
              | experimental results, and then used to assess various predictive breaking criteria.
              | Whether or not these predictive criteria can be used to distinguish the wave breaking
              | mechanism is also discussed. In section 3.5.2, the role of unsteadiness is discussed.

text          | Figure 3.16 compares the measured minimum Rig with the modeled Ri(t) from equa-

              | effects on the velocity field over the ridge, which leads to the difference in the mag-
              | nitude of Rig between the trough and the crest in the experimental data. For the

title         | Comparison of breaking criteria
blank         | 
text          | Two main breaking criteria have been presented in this study: an empirical break-
              | ing condition based on incident wave and topographic scales (figure 3.5), and a Rig
              | breaking condition. These two breaking criteria are not independent. The empirical
              | shoaling criterion simply indicates when the transition to breaking was observed in
              | the experiments, without regard to the particular breaking mechanism. Whereas,
              | an Rig condition indicates when shear may cause a flow to become unstable. The
              | relevance of these two criteria depend on the particular flow under consideration, as
              | there are cases when each criterion is more appropriate. For example, a shoaling cri-
              | terion based on a changing depth is not relevant to periodic interfacial waves passing
              | through a contraction in the channel width break, but waves did break at Rig ≈ 0.1
              | (Troy & Koseff, 2005b). On the other hand, surface waves at a beach are unlikely to
              | break due to interfacial shear at the air-water interface, but breaking criteria based on
              | a/h have been widely validated for this case. Figure 3.12 also highlights the relative
              | importance of shear and wave non-linearity.
              |    To compare the predictive capability of the empirical shoaling criterion shown in
              | figure 3.5 and an Rig criterion for the waves of this study, both criteria were rewritten
              | in terms of incident wave parameters (k∞ , a∞ ) and scales of the bathymetry and
              | stratification (h1 , h2 , hr , δ). Figure 3.17 shows how these two criteria compare for the
              | deep water waves of Troy & Koseff (2005b) in (a) as well as for two lower layer depths
              | over the ridge shown in (b) and (c). The model in equation 3.8 is used to find the
              | critical wave steepness, ka, associated with Rig = 0.25. Because the wave Richardson
              | model requires a constant of proportionality related to the definition of the interfacial
              | thickness (Troy & Koseff, 2005b), two estimates for the Rig = 0.25 shear criterion
              | are shown: ka = (8kδ/5.3)1/2 (coth(kh1 ) + coth(kh2 )) and ka = (4kδ)1/2 (coth(kh1 ) +
              | coth(kh2 )). For simplicity, conservation of wave energy and linear shoaling is assumed
              | to relate k and a over the ridge to incident wave values, k∞ and a∞ . The empirical
              | shoaling criterion corresponds to the curve in figure 3.5 that separates breaking from

              | two ridge cases in figures 3.17(b) and (c), the shear criterion curves and the empirical
              | shoaling curve fall within the same region of the parameter space. This suggests that
              | for the ridge cases, the shear criterion and the empirical shoaling criterion provide
              | similar predictive capability for the transition to breaking.
              |       Although figure 3.10 indicates that the agreement between the estimated Rig and
              | the experimental data is not perfect, the estimated Rig is sufficient to show that for
              | the ridge cases figures 3.17(b) and (c), the empirical shoaling criterion is roughly a
              | curve of constant Rig . While unsteadiness and wave non-linearity can alter the critical
              | value of Rig , Fringer & Street (2003) suggest that an unsteady wave flow breaking
              | at a constant Rig can indicate that shear is responsible for wave breaking. For the
              | wave-ridge interactions in this study, low values of Rig are correlated with high values
              | of a/hr , as shown in figure 3.12, although this is not universally true. A correlation
              | is also seen between Rig and the empirical shoaling criterion because the empirical
              | shoaling criterion depends strongly on a/hr over the ridge (figure 3.5). Because low
              | Rig and high wave nonlinearity are correlated for the parameters used in this study,
              | it is difficult to distinguish the impact of interfacial shear from the impact of wave
              | steepness on the initial wave instability.

text          | In time-varying flows, critical shear must be applied for sufficient time in order for
              | shear instability to develop (Troy & Koseff, 2005b). If the time the wave shear is
              | applied, τw , is long relative to the time scale for instability growth (τg ), then the
              | unsteadiness of the flow is not likely to restrict instability growth. Kao et al. (1985)
              | used a simple scaling to compare these time scales. The instability growth rate is
              | assumed to be linearly proportional to the maximum shear, so the ratio of time scales
              | is:
              |                              τw       ω −1         ∆umax

              | that the instability growth rate is not simply proportional to the maximum shear,
              | but instead is a function of Ri as well as the length scale of the perturbation to the
              | flow, for parallel, inviscid, steady shear flow (Hazel, 1972). Following Troy & Koseff’s
              | (2005b) application of Hazel’s result, the instability growth rate can be modeled:

text          | and then the growth can be integrated over the time sub-critical shear is present. This
              | is the growth rate for the most unstable perturbation, although in this case, the length
              | scale of the ridge may impact the wavelength of the instability. For the waves at the
              | threshold of instability discussed in section 3.4.4, the minimum values of Rig are not
              | substantially below Rig = 1/4. Therefore, the growth rates calculated using equation
              | 3.13 for waves on the threshold of instability are near zero. If a near-zero growth rate
              | is used for τg−1 , the wave time scale is much shorter than the instability growth rate.
              | This analysis would then suggest that there is not sufficient time for an instability to
              | develop in cases where overturning was indeed experimentally observed. As stated
              | earlier, shear and convection both seem to have a role in the initial instability. Because
              | of this, the instability growth rates for parallel, inviscid, steady shear flow may not
              | in fact be appropriate. While two imperfect growth rate estimates suggest that the
              | unsteadiness of the wave flow may inhibit instability development, the exact growth
              | rate for this case is unknown.
              |      The unsteadiness of the wave flow can also inhibit the development of a gravi-
              | tational instability, as illustrated in figure 3.18. Some of the larger amplitude wave

text          | breaking events appear to involve gravitational instability, such as figure 3.2(b). As
              | the wave face steepens and the crest of the wave accelerates out ahead of the wave,
              | the overhanging mass of denser water is gravitationally unstable. At this point, the
              | denser fluid may plunge downward, resulting in turbulence and mixing. In this case,
              | the relevant time scales are the wave time scale and the growth rate for gravitational
              | instability. If the wave phase changes before the dense fluid can plunge downward,
              | the wave may not become unstable. Often the criterion of u/c > 1 is used to de-
              | termine whether convective breaking is occurring. There are, however, cases where
              | the flow is gravitationally unstable in one instant, but this does not lead directly
              | to instability and convective breaking, as shown in figure 3.18. In this wave event,
              | there are clearly instantaneous unstable density profiles and locations where the local
              | velocity exceeds the phase speed of the wave, but the wave face ultimately does not
              | plunge downward. Although conditions for convective instability are not investigated
              | in great detail in this study, observations indicate that u/c > 1 is not a sufficient
              | criterion for instability in this case.

title         | 3.6      Conclusions
text          | Laboratory experiments have been used to investigate the breaking of progressive,
              | periodic, interfacial waves at a Gaussian ridge. The results clearly indicated that both
              | shear and convection played a role in the breaking events. Because both shear and
              | convective processes contributed to wave breaking, neither a shear instability criterion
              | nor a convective instability criterion such as u/c > 1 was appropriate for all cases
              | observed. Three types of breaking were observed: backward breaking, convective
              | forward plunging breaking and a mixed convective-shear breaking, referred to as
              | forward Kelvin-Helmholtz breaking. The breaking types were parameterized by a
              | scaled wave amplitude, a∞ /hr , and a scaled wavenumber, k∞ δ, and an empirical
              | condition based on these two parameters was used to determine a breaking transition
              | criterion for the range of parameters in this study.
              |    For waves at the threshold of instability, the minimum local gradient Richardson
              | number was 0.2 < Rig < 0.4, thus the canonical criterion of Rig ≤ 0.25 did not predict

text          | breaking in all cases. For shorter waves (k∞ δ > 0.06), the initial instability developed
              | at the wave crest, leading to backward overturning. For longer waves (k∞ δ < 0.06),
              | a mechanism related to separation of flow over the ridge seemed to lead to the initial
              | interfacial instability. This alternate breaking mechanism may be sensitive to the
              | Reynolds number and the ridge slope h0 /2σ.
              |      Even under these idealized laboratory conditions, measuring Rig is very difficult.
              | A simplified model is developed to estimate the Richardson number using only scales
              | of the incident wave (a∞ , k∞ ), background stratification and topography (δ, h2 , h1 ,
              | hr ). Despite the limitations of a constant Rig breaking criterion, this rough estimate
              | of Rig provides an indication of where in the parameter space interfacial shear is
              | likely to be important. The model also indicates that the empirical shoaling criterion
              | from section 3.4.1 is roughly equivalent to a curve of constant Rig for the ridge cases,
              | which is consistent with the idea that both interfacial shear and shoaling processes
              | may contribute to wave breaking. For deeper or more shallow waves relative to the
              | topography, either shear or non-linear wave steepening may dominate the breaking
              | process. The model could be applied to a particular case to estimate if an incident
              | wave is likely to break and which processes may be important. However, even if the
              | model can accurately predict that the minimum Richardson number for a given flow
              | is, say, Rig = 0.2, this is not sufficient to determine whether or not the wave will
              | break, due to the effects of unsteadiness and wave non-linearity.
              |      It is important to note that the canonical Richardson number criterion of Rig =
              | 0.25 is not, on its own, sufficient for determining when instability will occur in interfa-
              | cial wave flows. For increasingly non-linear waves, the assumptions of this criterion of
              | steady, parallel, and uniform flow become less and less appropriate, and the stability
              | boundaries of the flow may be affected. For example, oscillatory shear can have a
              | stabilizing or destabilizing effect on near-critical baroclinic flows (Pedlosky & Thom-
              | son, 2003). The results of Fringer & Street (2003), Troy & Koseff (2005b), Fructus
              | et al. (2009) and Barad & Fringer (2010) indicate that unsteadiness can alter stabil-
              | ity boundaries from the canonical values. Incident waves in this study are generated
              | under the same conditions as Troy & Koseff; the only difference is that the waves
              | in this study steepen at a ridge instead of at a contraction in the tank width. The

              | be quite similar between these two studies for a wave of the same incident ka and
              | kd, and one might expect that unsteadiness would lead to a similar critical Rig for
              | both cases. But when Rig = 0.2, the ridge case waves are near breaking or breaking,
              | whereas in the contraction case the waves are stable. This suggests that although
              | unsteadiness tends to decrease the critical Richardson number, the bathymetric inter-
              | action can increase the critical value due to non-linear steepening and flow separation.
              | The combined effect of unsteadiness and bathymetric interactions leads to a critical
              | value of Rig = 0.3 ± 0.1, in this study. The exact critical value will likely vary de-
              | pending on the particular bathymetric interaction. The gradient Richardson number
              | may provide a rough estimate of when interfacial waves may break, but because of
              | the sensitivity of wave stability to unsteadiness and non-linearity, caution should be
              | taken when applying a constant Rig breaking criterion to an internal wave flow.
              |    It is difficult to distinguish whether interfacial shear or wave steepness is the
              | primary cause of the initial wave instability because many waves in this study have
              | both low Rig and high non-linearity (a/hr ). Breaking at a relatively constant Rig
              | (Fringer & Street, 2003) as well as qualitative features (e.g., figure 3.2a) suggest that
              | shear plays an important role in the initial wave instability. As the incident wave
              | amplitude is increased, however, qualitative observations show elements of convective
              | instability as well as shear instability (see figure 3.4), suggesting that both wave
              | steepness and interfacial shear play a role in wave breaking. Because of the complex,
              | mixed nature of the wave instability, assuming the wave breaking is either shear or
              | convective in nature does not seem appropriate. Rather than assuming a mixing
              | efficiency based on the instability mechanism, further study is needed to directly
              | measure the mixing efficiency of such breaking events.

text          | Internal wave breaking appears to contribute significantly to the vertical mixing of

              | convert wave energy irreversibly to potential energy determines how much internal
              | wave energy may be available for mixing the ocean. Understanding what governs
              | this efficiency is critical to parameterizing smaller scale internal wave events within
              | larger scale ocean models. Many models continue to parameterize oceanic mixing by

              | scale of the incident wave (Michallet & Ivey, 1999). In the numerical simulations
              | of Slinn & Riley (1996), critical wave rays focusing on a slope have a mixing effi-
              | ciency of 0.35. Interfacial wave breaking in deep water was considered by Fringer &
              | Street (2003) who reported a peak overall efficiency of 0.36 ± 0.02 for highly nonlin-
              | ear, progressive interfacial waves in numerical simulations and suggest the instability
              | is convective, based on the high mixing efficiency. Although the mixing efficiency
              | might be quite high during the laminar roll-up of a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in
              | a stratified shear flow, most of the mixing occurs after the transition to turbulence
              | at an efficiency near 0.2, based on the results of numerical simulations (Smyth et al.,
              | 2001; Peltier & Caulfield, 2003).
              |      The mixing efficiency in a stratified flow can vary with the instability mechanism.
              | Purely convective instabilities may have a mixing efficiency of up to 0.5 (Linden
              | & Redondo, 1991), whereas the mixing efficiency for parallel, steady shear flows is
              | lower, typically about 0.2 (e.g., Peltier & Caulfield, 2003). In part because of this
              | significant difference in efficiency, there has been much interest in whether internal
              | wave breaking is driven primarily by shear or convection. Hult et al. (2009) examine

              | at a ridge and found that until the scaled amplitude over the ridge, a/hr , is increased
              | above a critical value, waves are initially stable. At a higher a/hr , the waves exhibit
              | backward breaking, and at yet higher a/hr , forward convective breaking begins to
              | occur. For sufficiently long, high amplitude waves shear instabilities can contribute
              | to wave breaking at the ridge, as well. Because the qualitative mechanism of the wave

              | internal solitary wave reflection and energy loss scale monotonically with ζ. Wessels
              | & Hutter (1996) considered the energy budget for internal solitary waves interacting
              | with a ridge and found that up to 55% of the wave energy was dissipated in the wave-
              | ridge interaction, and the dissipated fraction is maximum when 0.8 < B < 1.1. Chen

text          | Experiments were performed in a 480cm long by 30cm wide by 60cm tall tank with
              | a vertically oscillating semi-cylindrical wavemaker at one end and a horsehair beach
              | at the other end. The stratification consisted of two homogenous layers separated
              | by a thin interface. At the start of each experiment, the interfacial thickness was
              | δ = 1.5cm±0.14cm. The lower layer had depth h1,∞ = 26cm and density ρ1 = 0.9996g
              | cm−3 , and the upper layer had depth h2 = 30cm and density ρ2 = 1.0097g cm−3 . The
              | Gaussian ridge was 20.2cm tall and extends 100cm or 4 standard deviations (σ) in
              | length. The forced wave frequency was ω = 0.59rad s−1 and the incident amplitude,
              | a∞ was varied between 0cm and 4.4cm, as shown in table 1 with various non-linearity
              | parameters for comparison with other wave-ridge studies.
              |      Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) was used to image the flow during the
              | experiments (e.g., Crimaldi, 2008). Laser fluorescent dye (Rhodamine 6G) was added
              | to the more dense, lower layer at a concentration of 50ppb. An argon-ion laser and a
              | scanning mirror were used to generate a light sheet which imaged by a 1024x1024 pixel
              | CCD camera. The PLIF images were analyzed to track the movement of the interface,
              | as this method was found to be more reliable than using ultrasonic interfacial wave

text          |    To assess the efficiency of wave breaking at converting wave energy irreversibly to
              | potential energy through mixing, the change in wave energy and background potential
              | energy due to the event must be calculated. In the laboratory, the entire wave tank
              | can be used as a control volume for internal wave mixing experiments (Ivey & Nokes,
              | 1989; Michallet & Ivey, 1999). In the experiments in this study, energy enters the
              | control volume via the oscillating wave maker which transfers energy to the fluid in
              | the form of internal waves. There is both kinetic and potential energy associated
              | with the periodic waves propagating along the density interface. As the waves break
              | at the ridge, some of the wave energy is converted to turbulent kinetic and potential
              | energy, while some of the wave energy continues to propagate as waves, either reflected
              | back from or transmitted past the ridge. Of the energy in the turbulence, some
              | will be converted irreversibly to potential energy via molecular mixing hastened by
              | turbulent straining. The rest of the turbulent energy eventually will be dissipated as

text          | heat. Energy propagating away from the ridge as waves will eventually be primarily
              | dissipated as heat, as the waves are damped by the horsehair beach and the tank walls.
              | Over time, some fluid will also tend to diffuse across the density interface, thickening
              | this interface and converting the heat (internal energy) of the fluid irreversibly to
              | potential energy. Once the fluid in the control volume of the tank has come to rest,
              | the final potential energy can be compared with the initial potential energy to indicate
              | how much mixing occurred during the experiment. Viscous effects and background
              | diffusion are accounted for in the calculations of efficiency.

text          |      The procedure for the overall event efficiency experiments, adapted from Troy
              | (2003), is as follows. First, an initial density profile was established at t = 0s, using
              | conductivity-temperature probe plunging vertically at 10cm s−1 . Next, starting at
              | t = 30s a train of waves was generated by the wavemaker. Sinusoidal oscillations
              | of the wavemaker were increased from zero amplitude to the maximum amplitude
              | over 1 wave period, then 10 waves were generated at the maximum amplitude, and
              | finally the amplitude was reduced to zero over 1 wave period. During this time, im-
              | ages were taken at either upstream of the ridge at xu = −65cm or downstream at
              | xd = 85cm. Although ideally measurements would have been taken upstream and
              | downstream simultaneously for each experimental run, constraints on the imaging
              | equipment allowed interfacial displacement measurements at only one station at a
              | time. The variation between experiments was quite small (see figures 4.5 and 4.8), so
              | the error associated with comparing upstream and downstream interfacial displace-
              | ment measurements from different experiments is thought to be minimal. Finally,
              | after motions in the tank quieten down, a final density profile is obtained at t = 630s.
              | The mixing induced by the motion of the probe was negligible relative to background
              | diffusion in the tank. This procedure was repeated for a∞ between 0cm and 4.4cm,
              | with 2 to 6 (typically 4) repetitions for each wave amplitude, providing 2 to 6 pairs
              | of initial and final density profiles and 1 to 3 interfacial displacement records at the
              | upstream and downstream locations. The wave amplitudes are shown in table 4.1.

title         | 4.3      Results
text          | Figure 4.2 shows density fields calculated from PLIF images for breaking events of
              | three incident wave amplitudes. As the incident amplitude is increased, breaking
              | becomes more vigorous and the resulting turbulent patch becomes larger in size. After
              | the initial wave instability, the flow transitions to turbulence, and then eventually
              | decays. The mixed fluid resulting from the turbulent event eventually spreads away
              | from the point of breaking along the interface. In figure 4.2(a), the wave is just
              | past the breaking threshold and breaks mildly backwards, whereas (b) shows a more
              | vigorous forward breaking wave, and (c) shows an even more vigorous breaking event.
              | From the density fields in figure 4.2, it is clear that the higher the amplitude, the more
              | mixing occurs during the breaking event, as the local interfacial thickness increases
              | substantially in (c) compared with sequence (a). Quantitative evidence of this trend
              | is presented later in section 4.3.3.

title         | 4.3.1     Wave reflection and transmission
text          | For each incident wave, some energy is reflected back from the ridge. When a portion
              | of the incident wave energy reflects back from the obstacle, the result is a spatial
              | modulation of the wave amplitude upstream of the obstacle, as the reflected wave
              | constructively and destructively interferes with the incident wave (e.g., Dean & Dal-
              | rymple, 1984). The coefficient of reflection is typically defined as the ratio of the
              | reflected wave amplitude and the incident wave amplitude, CR ≡ aref lected /aincident .
              | Here, CR can be estimated from the variation of the measured wave amplitude in
              | space:

              | minus the reflected portion: a∞ = (a2incident − a2ref lected )1/2 . In figure 4.3(a), the
              | reflection coefficient, CR , decreases as the wavenumber, kh1 , is increased for waves
              | of constant incident amplitude. The error bars shown reflect variation in the fitted
              | parameters between two repetitions of the experiment. The trend in CR seen in figure
              | 4.3(a) may be consistent with the oscillation with kh1 seen in surface waves reflecting
              | from a submerged obstacle (e.g., Mei & Black, 1969). Previous work indicates that
              | internal wave reflection is sensitive to the height of the interface above the obstacle
              | via the degree of blocking, B (Wessels & Hutter, 1996), but B is not varied in this
              | study. Somewhat surprisingly, the reflection coefficient appears to be insensitive to
              | the incident wave amplitude, as shown in figure 4.3(b), where CR = 0.30 ± 0.05. A
              | reflection coefficient of CR = 0.30 corresponds to approximately 9% of the incident
              | wave energy being reflected back from the ridge for both breaking and non-breaking
              | waves. The fact that CR is indifferent to whether or not the wave is breaking suggests
              | that wave reflection from the ridge slope may take place upstream of where the
              | breaking event occurs at the ridge crest. It is possible that CR may be affected by
              | breaking when waves are shorter relative to the depth (higher k∞ h1 ), or when the
              | wave slope (h0 /2σ) is steeper, either of which would compress the horizontal region
              | over which breaking and reflection occur. The range of CR for the periodic waves in
              | this study corresponds reasonably well with the results for internal solitary waves of
              | depression reported by Chen (2009), where 0.3 < CR < 0.6 for 0.8 < ζ < 1.0 (see
              | table 1 to relate ζ and a∞ /hr in this study). It appears that for periodic, progressive
              | interfacial waves, however, CR varies with the length scale of the wave, and the
              | parameter ζ does not capture this dependence explicitly as Chen studied solitary
              | waves where a and k are not independent.

              | wave energy per unit width propagating past a given location over the time interval

              | (Wessels & Hutter, 1996; Troy, 2003). This estimate requires that local changes in
              | depth be small relative to the wavelength, that energy is propagating in one direction,
              | and that the Boussinesq approximation is valid. Because a small fraction of incident
              | wave energy does reflect back from the ridge as discussed above, the upstream mea-
              | surement location was chosen to coincide with a spatial node in the primary wave
              | amplitude. At the node, the reflected component destructively interferes with the

              | refers to the wave energy change due to the breaking event. ∆W Evisc is the wave

text          | the ridge-less case is shown in figure 4.5. It is important to note that the ridge-less

              |      A second method to estimate ∆W Evisc is to use the theory developed by Troy &

text          | ∆W Etotal measured in the ridge-less case.
              |       A final method for estimating ∆W Evisc was developed by Troy (2003). In this
              | method, ∆W Evisc is extrapolated from the total change in wave energy for non-
              | breaking waves. In figure 4.5, a quadratic curve is fit to the non-breaking wave points
              | using least squares. Because viscous wave energy losses scale with the square of
              | the wave velocity, (aω)2 , a quadratic curve with an a2 dependence is chosen. This
              | quadratic curve is then extrapolated to give an estimate of viscous losses for the
              | breaking waves. In figure 4.5, ∆W Etotal increases much more steeply for the breaking
              | wave cases. The estimate of ∆W Evisc from this extrapolation method is slightly
              | higher than either the ridge-less case estimate or the linear viscous decay theory
              | estimate.
              |       The three methods for estimating ∆W Evisc give similar results, as shown in figure
              | 4.5. Because viscous losses increase where the ridge restricts the lower layer depth,
              | it is expected that the no ridge case would lead to a lower ∆W Evisc . The viscous
              | decay theory is linear, and thus it is not surprising that the associated estimate of
              | ∆W Evisc is slightly less than the extrapolation method estimate. For these reasons,
              | the extrapolation method is used in final estimate of Ri0 , and it is shown later that
              | the viscous theory estimate yields very similar results. The reason for including all
              | three methods is simply to support the extrapolation method and offer alternative
              | methods for use when extrapolation is not feasible.

text          | With the results discussed in this study thus far, the end fate of all of the incident wave

              | was reflected from the ridge, dissipated through laminar viscous decay, transferred
              | to higher harmonics, transmitted past the ridge, converted irreversibly to potential

              | mitted wave energy at twice the forcing frequency (2ω1 ) is shown separately from
              | the rest of the transmitted wave energy. The energy transmitted at twice the forcing
              | frequency (2ω1 ) peaks when a∞ /hr ≈ 0.4. While a substantial fraction of the inci-

              | wave energy goes to irreversible mixing (∆P Ebreak ). The portion of energy dissipated
              | during breaking appears to level off as a∞ /hr approaches unity. While the distribu-
              | tion in figure 4.10 provides a overview of how energy is transferred, the percentages
              | in the distribution may change with wave and topographic parameters. As seen in

title         | 4.4        Discussion
text          | The overall event efficiency of 3−8% is much lower than the 36% efficiency reported for
              | deep water interfacial wave breaking (Fringer & Street, 2003; Troy, 2003). The range
              | reported here is consistent with the 15% ± 5% efficiency reported by Helfrich (1992),
              | or the 7% to 25% efficiency reported by Michallet & Ivey (1999), both for breaking
              | solitary waves at a slope. It is important to note that Michallet and Ivey did not
              | account for background diffusive effects in their analysis, which would conservatively
              | lower the efficiency range to 3% − 22%. It does not appear that the initial instability
              | mechanism is indicative of the overall event efficiency here, although Rf,0 does increase
              | slightly with the wave nonlinearity.
              |    It is reasonable that the overall efficiency of an event would be lower for a topog-
              | raphy induced breaking event than for deep water wave breaking. In a deep water
              | breaking event, both density overturning and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation are
              | focused along the interface. When breaking occurs at a ridge or slope, on the other
              | hand, the wave flow tends to be focused along the topographic boundary. A two-layer
              | wave interaction with a topographic feature may, however, lead to boundary layer dis-
              | sipation and possibly separation vortices within the well-mixed lower layer that do

              | two-layer wave breaking at the ridge may be lower than a deep water breaking event,
              | due to these regions with weak density gradients. In Chapter 5, high-resolution mea-
              | surements over the spatial domain are used to explore this hypothesis of variation
              | in local mixing processes. In a continuously stratified water column, there would
              | be density gradients to mix out at any point along the topography, which may in-
              | crease the overall event efficiency relative to the two layer case. In a linearly stratified
              | flow, internal waves reflecting from a uniform slope can lead to elevated diapycnal
              | mixing along the slope (Cacchione & Wunsch, 1974; Ivey & Nokes, 1989). The mix-
              | ing efficiency of internal waves in a continuous stratification characteristic of oceanic
              | environments is a potential area for future work.
              |      The dependence of the overall efficiency on the topographic slope, wave frequency
              | or interface height was not explored here. As the frequency is varied for a fixed to-
              | pography, the efficiency may vary. Both the percent of incident energy transmitted
              | for internal solitary waves passing over a ridge (Helfrich, 1992) and the overall effi-
              | ciency of solitary waves breaking at a uniform slope (Michallet & Ivey, 1999) have
              | been shown to vary with the length scale of the wave.
              |      It is possible that the sidewall or bottom boundary layers may become turbulent
              | as the wave amplitude is increased. In this case, the choice of an a2 dependence
              | of ∆W Evisc or the use of laminar viscous theory to estimate the non-breaking wave
              | energy loss may not be appropriate. Troy & Koseff (2006) suggest the transition to
              | turbulence occurs when the sidewall Reynolds number Rs = umax Lorbit /ν is 200-800,
              | where Lorbit is the orbital excursion distance. The conservative approximations for
              | this case, umax ≈ aω, and Lorbtit ≈ a, give Rs = 300−1200 for the breaking wave cases
              | which suggests the sidewall boundary layers are probably turbulent for the highest
              | amplitude cases in this study. In these experiments, the dominant contribution to
              | viscous damping is from sidewall damping for most of the tank length except over the
              | very crest of the ridge, where damping at the bottom is dominant. If the transition
              | to turbulent sidewall boundary layers occurs, the viscous damping rate is expected
              | to increase compared to the laminar rate. Assuming the effect of turbulent sidewall

text          | to the region near the density interface, the overall efficiency measured in this study
              | would be underestimated. The overall event efficiency is not, however, terribly sen-
              | sitive to the sidewall damping coefficient. If a transition to turbulence doubled the
              | sidewall and bottom damping coefficients estimated by the laminar theory of Troy &
              | Koseff (2006), then Rf,0 would only increase by about 2% to give Rf,0 = 5 − 10%, as-
              | suming no change in ∆P E. Furthermore, estimates using the local mixing efficiency
              | in a subsequent manuscript are consistent with the overall event efficiencies calculated
              | in this study.
              |    A related issue is how to distinguish breaking and non-breaking related wave en-
              | ergy losses over the ridge. Because of the relatively low Reynolds number of these
              | experiments, it is important to consider effects that may be specific to the laboratory
              | setup, i.e. ∆W Evisc . As breaking events at the ridge become more vigorous, however,
              | it becomes much more difficult to distinguish bottom boundary layer effects from the
              | overturning event itself. For example, in some wave-ridge interactions, strong flow
              | over the ridge in the vertically constricted lower layer separates and the development
              | of a large vortex is observed on the upstream side of the ridge as the wave crest ap-
              | proaches. In a vigorous wave breaking event, vortices generated through overturning
              | at the interface can interact with this separation vortex ((see Chapter 3, figure 3.15
              | and Chapter 5, figure 5.5). Although the separation vortex may develop indepen-
              | dently from the instability at the density interface, the two regions of overturning
              | can quickly become indistinguishable. The generation of this separation vortex no
              | doubt has an influence on the overall event efficiency, as energy is transferred from
              | the propagating wave to the vortex. The excitement of this vortex may depend on the
              | topographic slope as well as the Reynolds number of the flow (Diamessis & Redekopp,
              | 2006).

              | over the ridge, where the fraction of energy transmitted tends to decrease as the am-

              | wavenumber, kh1 . When the amplitude is varied for a fixed wavenumber, kh1 = 2.0,
              | the reflection coefficient remains constant at CR = 0.30 ± 0.05 for non-breaking and

              |      The fraction of wave energy lost in the breaking event that is converted irreversibly
              | to potential energy, referred to as the overall event efficiency Rf,0 , is estimated by
              | using the wave tank as a control volume. The wave energy is measured upstream and
              | downstream of the breaking event, and viscous losses not associated with the breaking
              | event are estimated with several methods including extrapolating from non-breaking
              | wave cases and viscous decay theory (Troy & Koseff, 2006). The overall event effi-
              | ciency is between 3% and 8% ± 1% for waves of varied incident amplitude. There

              | ing events, however, the efficiency tends to increase slightly with the non-linearity
              | (a∞ /hr ). While this efficiency is consistent with results for breaking internal waves
              | at topography (Ivey & Nokes, 1989; Helfrich, 1992; Michallet & Ivey, 1999), the mea-
              | sured efficiency of interfacial waves in deep water is as high as 36% (Fringer & Street,
              | 2003; Troy, 2003). The relatively low overall efficiency appears to be related to spatial
              | variability in the mixing processes. The wave–ridge interaction can lead to separation
              | of the lower layer flow over the ridge, which in turn can cause enhanced turbulent
              | kinetic energy dissipation as shown in Chapter 5. In this region of enhanced dissi-
              | pation within the essentially homogenous lower layer, the expected mixing efficiency
              | would be quite low as there are no density gradients to mix, and this could reduce
              | the overall mixing efficiency relative to the deep water case where turbulence is con-
              | centrated in the interfacial region. The impact of spatial variability on the overall
              | efficiency is investigated in Chapter 5. In considering the energy available to mix the
              | ocean from breaking internal waves, it appears a simple, constant mixing efficiency
              | is not appropriate as the wave properties, stratification and topography can lead to
              | spatially varying mixing conditions.

title         | 5.1         Introduction
text          | Internal wave breaking is thought to a major source of vertical mixing in in the ocean.
              | Therefore, the fraction of internal wave energy that is converted to irreversible, di-
              | apycnal mixing in these breaking events is of paramount importance to larger scale
              | ocean and climate modeling efforts. The smallest scales of these turbulent mixing
              | processes in the ocean are typically of centimeter scale, whereas the grid cell of an
              | ocean circulation model is tens to hundreds of kilometers in size. Thus, appropri-
              | ate parameterization of these small scale mixing processes is required. While simple
              | models based on bulk properties of the flow are often the most convenient to im-
              | plement, the spatial and temporal variability in ocean mixing processes may require
              | more complex parameterization (Ivey et al., 2008).
              |        In Chapter 4, we showed that the fraction of the wave energy loss that is converted
              | irreversibly to potential energy (the overall event efficiency) is 3 − 8% for a train of

              | Nokes, 1989; Helfrich, 1992; Michallet & Ivey, 1999), this efficiency is significantly
              | lower than the 20% mixing efficiency typically assumed for stratified shear flows (e.g.,
              | Peltier & Caulfield, 2003) and the 36% efficiency calculated for interfacial waves
              | breaking in deep water (Fringer & Street, 2003). This discrepancy may be due to
              | spatial and temporal variability in the mixing processes in the wave–ridge interaction.
              | In this study, high-resolution density and velocity measurements are used explore local
              | mixing processes within the turbulent, breaking event.
              |      Two key questions are considered in this paper: How does spatial variability impact
              | the overall event efficiency? and What sets the local mixing efficiency within the
              | turbulent patch?    In Chapter 4, it was proposed that the overall event efficiency
              | is relatively low because the topographic interaction leads to turbulence within the
              | homogenous, lower layer. That is, because there are essentially no density gradients
              | to overturn within the lower layer, the local mixing efficiency in this region must be
              | quite low if any turbulent kinetic energy dissipation is present. To investigate this
              | hypothesis, the ideal experiments would measure density and velocity fluctuations
              | down to the smallest scales throughout the event. In practice, there are limitations
              | on the physical scales that can be resolved and on the accuracy with which quantities
              | can be measured. Although directly measuring the local buoyancy flux and turbulent
              | kinetic energy dissipation directly is very challenging, the spatial or temporal variation
              | in these quantities can be seen even if the absolute values are difficult to determine.
              | For example, even though all relevant scales may not be resolved, direct calculation of
              | the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation, ', from velocity gradients and the dissipation
              | of scalar gradients, χ, can indicate where velocity and density overturning occur in
              | greatest magnitude.

              | flux associated with the internal wave field can be large relative to the contribution

              | (Rehmann, 1995). Two overturning, immiscible fluids, for example, may have a

text          |    Winters et al. (1995) suggest a more thorough definition of the mixing efficiency

              | tion that would result if the turbulent fluid were allowed to adiabatically come to rest,
              | whereas the available component is the total potential energy at that instant. The
              | mixing efficiency at a point in time can be calculated from the dissipation rate and
              | the rate of change of the background potential energy. While this method provides an
              | elegant conceptual framework for investigating the temporal variation of the mixing
              | efficiency throughout an event, the requirement of knowing the density and dissipa-

              |    Subsequent results have suggested that the overall mixing efficiency of a turbulent
              | event depends on the nature of the instability leading to the turbulence. The effi-
              | ciency of stratified turbulence at mixing a flow can vary significantly between about
              | 0.5 for a purely gravitational instability (Linden & Redondo, 1991), and typically 0.2
              | for a parallel, steady shear flow (e.g., Peltier & Caulfield, 2003). Limited measure-
              | ments exist, however, for the mixing efficiency of breaking internal waves. In the
              | laboratory, experiments by Ivey & Nokes (1989) suggest that for first mode internal
              | waves breaking on a slope in a linearly stratified fluid, the overall mixing efficiency
              | reaches a maximum of 0.2 when the slope of the wave characteristic is equal to the
              | beach slope. The overall efficiency for interfacial solitary waves breaking on a slope
              | reaches a maximum of 0.25 (Michallet & Ivey, 1999). In the numerical simulations of
              | Slinn & Riley (1996)) critical wave rays focusing on a slope have a mixing efficiency of
              | 0.35. Fringer & Street (2003) use DNS to measure a peak value of 0.36 ± 0.02 for the
              | mixing efficiency of a highly nonlinear, progressive interfacial wave. Grid-generated
              | turbulence has often be used in the lab to simulate the oceanic mixing environment
              | and results suggest that the mixing efficiency is quite low, and is only about 5%, (e.g.,
              | Rehmann & Koseff, 2004). More recent DNS and rapid distortion theory results sug-
              | gest that the efficiency of homogeneous, decaying, stably stratified turbulence can be
              | as high as 30%, and that the discrepancy with experimental results could feasibly be
              | accounted for by the energy transported by surface waves, for example (Stretch et al.,
              | 2010).

title         | 5.3.1     Simultaneous PIV and PLIF
text          | PIV and PLIF techniques are used to obtain simultaneous fields of density and velocity
              | in a 2D, x-z slice of the flow. When the flow is stratified, unsteady, non-uniform, and
              | turbulent, each of these traits bring unique challenges.
              |    Unsteadiness: In any PIV measurement, there is uncertainty, but often averag-
              | ing in time can reduce such uncertainty significantly. Because this wave flow varies
              | periodically over fairly short wave time scales and spatially over small length scales,
              | phase averaging must be used. Here, event realizations are limited in number and
              | conditions are not completely repeatable from one wave breaking event to the next
              | complicating the phase averaging process. The stratification tends to mix out over
              | multiple breaking events, changing initial conditions and increasing the random ve-
              | locity perturbations from previous events. As a result, typical experiments contain
              | 8 consecutive wave breaking events before the stratification is reset. The separation
              | of the mean, wave, and turbulent components of the velocity is discussed further in
              | section 5.3.4.
              |    Turbulence: Turbulent flows contain a wide range of scales of motion, whereas
              | PIV systems are typically set up to minimize error for a limited range of velocities.
              | The error in PIV measurements has been shown to depend on both the particle
              | displacement and the shear rate (Fincham & Spedding, 1997). To calculate dissipation
              | directly from measured velocity gradients, the turbulent velocities must be measured
              | down to the scale of the Kolmogorov scale, LK . Because the smallest and largest scales

text          | can be separated by a factor of up to 105 in oceanic mixing environments (Ivey et al.,
              | 2008), it is often very difficult to use PIV to capture the full range of turbulent scales
              | even on the laboratory scale. A number of techniques have been developed to use
              | PIV measurements to estimate the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate including
              | spectrum fitting, structure functions, and direct calculation from velocity gradients
              | (e.g., Variano & Cowen, 2008). It appears that sub-Kolmogorov scale resolution
              | (0.2 < ∆x/LK < 0.5) may be necessary to accurately calculate the dissipation rate
              | directly from PIV velocity data (Tanaka & Eaton, 2007).
              |    Stratification: In a stratified flow, matching the index of refraction between the
              | two layers is necessary to measure turbulent velocities so that particle motions can
              | be imaged clearly (Ferrier et al., 1993; Daviero et al., 2001; Diez et al., 2005). Here,
              | the index of refraction was matched using a dilute alcohol solution in the upper layer
              | (ρ2 = 994.7kg/m3) and a salt solution in the lower layer (ρ1 = 1004.8kg/m3), as
              | described in Chapter 3. In addition, sufficient particle seeding is needed, as the signal
              | to noise ratio for the PIV velocity measurements are sensitive to seeding density with
              | an optimum seeding density of approximately 0.05 particles per pixel (Fincham &
              | Spedding, 1997). It can be challenging to ensure even particle seeding in a stratified
              | flow, as the fluid density may not match the particle density well at all depths. From
              | the PIV images in this study, it appears that there are about 4 times more particles
              | present in the upper layer than in the lower layer.

              | 3ms time gap between the 2 PIV images. Optical filters are used to image only the
              | particles with the PIV camera and only the dye with the PLIF camera. The particles
              | emit light at 514nm, the same wavelength as the laser emission. The laser fluorescent
              | dye, on the other hand, emits light at a range of wavelengths, where peak emission
              | is at longer wavelengths than the laser emission. Therefore, a narrow bandpass filter
              | is used for the PIV camera allowing only wavelengths from 513 − 516nm to reach the
              | camera, as shown in figure 5.1. Because there is some dye emission in this frequency
              | band, transmission band of the PIV filter was chosen to be very small. Dye emission
              | is not detected in the resulting PIV images. On the PLIF camera, a wider bandpass

              | position over the ridge and across the light sheet. To correct for this variation in
              | baseline intensity, a background intensity image was generated using a homogenous
              | dye distribution. From this background dye intensity distribution, the intensity at
              | each location is measured as a fraction of the intensity at the center of the image.
              | This spatial correction factor was then applied to experimental images. Because this
              | variation was related to the laser sheet and was not present in the dye-free upper
              | layer, the correction factor is scaled with the dye intensity so that only regions of the

title         | 5.3.3     PIV processing
text          | The PIV images are processed first using the MatPIV code developed for MatLab
              | by J.S. Sveen. The intensity capping method of Shavit et al. (2007) is used to limit
              | the intensity of the brightest pixels to reduce peak-locking error. The smallest sub-
              | windows in the PIV processing are 32 by 32 pixels in size, with 50% overlap. The
              | resulting velocity fields have vectors at 1mm spacing. To further reduce peak-locking
              | error, the Fourier shifting technique of Liao & Cowen (2005) with edge windowing
              | was then applied to the MatPIV output velocity fields. Although this process reduces
              | peak-locking effects noticeably, the relatively low seeding density in these experiments
              | (0.004 to 0.02 particles per pixel, ideally 0.05 (Fincham & Spedding, 1997)) limited
              | the extent to which peak-locking error could be removed. The method of Westerweel
              | & Scarano (2005) developed for flows with shear was applied to identify errant velocity
              | vectors and then linear interpolation was used to replace the outlying vectors.

              | This estimate is most appropriate for isotropic turbulence. In the case of breaking
              | interfacial waves, a number of factors may lead to anisotropic turbulence. First, the
              | flow is stratified, so buoyant forces will tend to damp vertical motions. Second, the
              | turbulence is generated at the interface between the two layers, due, in part, to shear
              | instabilities. In a parallel shear flow, (∂u/∂z)2 tends to be larger than (∂w/∂x)2 .
              | PIV results suggest that the imposed wave shear across the density interface leads to

              | later, however, the error introduced by the assumptions of isotropy is thought to be
              | relatively small.
              |    When calculating spatial velocity derivatives from PIV velocity fields, there is
              | a truncation error associated with the discrete spatial derivative method as well as
              | measurement error for the velocity values. It is often difficult to select sufficient spatial
              | resolution to resolve the fine scale velocity gradients in the dissipation range without
              | measurement error terms that scale inversely with ∆x becoming large (Saarenrinne
              | & Piirto, 2000; Tanaka & Eaton, 2007). For this study, the measurement error in the
              | velocity is eu = 0.2cm s−1 and the measurement grid spacing was ∆x = 0.1cm, leading
              | to a bias error for ' of order 10− 5m2 s−3 and an uncertainty of about 3 × 10−6 m2 s−3 .
              |    Because the measurement error eu and the under-resolution of the dissipative
              | scales have competing effects on the bias error, a more involved error analysis was per-

              | discrete derivatives are used to estimate the error associated with direct calculations

              | results Tanaka & Eaton (2007) obtained from synthetically generated PIV images. A
              | correction factor is calculated as a function of the measured dissipation rate to obtain

text          | This section focuses on the breaking event that occurs when an interfacial wave of
              | incident amplitude a∞ /hr = 0.6 shoals at the Gaussian ridge and eventually becomes
              | unstable. Figure 5.5 illustrates one such breaking event at several phases of the

text          | wave. As the wave shoals, the wave crest accelerates out in front of the wave and
              | eventually plunges downward, in a forward, plunging breaking event (figure 5.5 a.i ).
              | After this convective-like instability, a local transition to turbulence is apparent (a.i
              | and a.ii ). In Hult et al. (2009) the competition between interfacial shear and wave
              | steepening is discussed, as the wave crest propagates over the ridge. The competition
              | between these effects is shown by the vorticity field in figure 5.5b.iii, where the positive
              | vorticity at the wave crest is due to the interfacial shear and the negative vorticity to
              | the right of the wave crest appears to be associated with the downward plunge and
              | subsequent clockwise churning of the gravitational instability. As the initial instability
              | transitions to turbulence, density gradients within the patch are strained, generating
              | fine structure in χ, and eventually gradients are obscured through molecular mixing.

text          |    Within the lower layer, as the trough of the wave passes over the ridge crest the
              | flow appears to separate from the ridge boundary, leading to the development of a
              | vortex and subsequently enhanced turbulent kinetic energy dissipation in this area.
              | This separation of flow at the boundary beneath a passing internal wave has been
              | observed in the field (Bogucki et al., 1997), in numerical simulations (Diamessis &
              | Redekopp, 2006) and in laboratory experiments (Carr & Davies, 2006; Carr et al.,
              | 2008; Boegman & Ivey, 2009), however in these observations, the boundary is typically
              | a significant distance from the wave density interface. Here, on the other hand, the
              | thin lower layer thickness over the ridge crest relative to the wave amplitude leads to
              | interaction between the separation vortex and vortices generated through breaking
              | at the interface.

              | calculation of the dissipation rate is accurately resolved, the energy dissipated locally
              | integrated over the entire event will be equal to ∆W E = 3.2 × 10−3 J/wave.
              |    There are two main steps to adjust the raw dissipation rate calculated from the
              | PIV velocity field. First, the spectral correction factor introduced in section 5.3.5 is
              | applied to adjust for the relative effects of noise and under-resolution of the smallest
              | scales. Then, the magnitude of the local dissipation rate is scaled so that the inte-
              | grated total over the entire event is equal to the known total change in wave energy
              | for the breaking event (from Chapter 4). Figure 5.6 shows the dissipated energy from
              | the raw dissipation rate (left bar), separated into the upper layer, patch and lower
              | layer regions. Then, the spectral correction is applied (center bar). Finally the total
              | energy from the spectral-corrected, direct calculation is scaled to equal ∆W E (right
              | bar).
              |    Although in this study, the under-resolved direct calculation of ' is scaled using
              | measurements of the overall change in wave energy, ∆W E, such overall measurements
              | are not always available. Applying a spectral correction factor as discussed in section
              | 5.3.5 can provide a means to estimate the order of magnitude of a direct calculation
              | of ' in a more general case. However, when the spectral correction is applied to the
              | direct calculation of ', the correction overcompensates for the effects of unresolved
              | dissipative scales, and the spectral-corrected dissipated energy is 2.6 times greater
              | than ∆W E from Chapter 4. The spectral correction method may overestimate the
              | dissipated energy due to the fact the model spectrum in the spectral correction as-
              | sumes fully developed turbulent flow. The wave forcing evolves quickly relative to the

              | down to smaller dissipative scales, this range of scales is not necessarily present at all
              | phases of the wave, which may lead the spectral correction method to overestimate
              | the unresolved dissipation. Anisotropy of the turbulence as well as spatial variation in
              | the velocity measurement error, eu , could also contribute to the discrepancy between
              | the spectral correction prediction and ∆W E. While the spectral correction factor
              | does not predict very accurately the effect of bias error in the direct calculation of
              | ' in this unsteady case, the method may be helpful in cases where there is great
              | uncertainty in the magnitude of '.
              |    In figure 5.7(a), the shaded areas show the total dissipated energy at each phase
              | of the wave, within the upper layer, the patch and the lower layer, where the total
              | dissipated energy over the wave period is scaled to be equal to ∆W E from Chapter 4.
              | It is assumed here that the time dependence of the direct calculation of ' is indicative
              | of the time variation of the actual dissipation of energy in the flow. For reference,
              | the total dissipated energy from the raw direct calculation and the direct calculation
              | with spectral correction are also shown in figure 5.7(a).
              |    Figure 5.7(b) shows the average dissipation rate from direct calculation in the
              | patch (referred to as 'p,best ), the upper layer and the lower layer. Note that the mean
              | dissipation rate in the upper layer is much lower than in the lower layer or within
              | the patch and is on the order of the estimated noise floor (3 × 10−6 m2 /s3 ). For the
              | remainder of the study, 'p,best is taken as the best estimate for ' in the overturning
              | patch.
              |    There are a number of sources of uncertainty in this estimate of '. The total
              | dissipated energy is scaled to be consistent with ∆W E from Chapter 4, and there is
              | an uncertainty of ±10% associated with ∆W E. It is assumed here is that the energy
              | dissipation associated with the breaking event is captured within the field of view.
              | Because not all wave energy is expected to be dissipated within the field of view and
              | because some portion of ∆W E is converted irreversibly to potential energy, the total
              | energy dissipated within the field of view as well as the mean dissipation rates may
              | be up to 30% lower than indicated in figure 5.7(b). This scaling also assumes that

              | tion method suggests that the local dissipation rate may be underestimated, despite

              | the spatial and temporal variability and the local mixing efficiency.
              |    In this study, a limited number of wave events were ensemble averaged, which
              | leads to uncertainty in the direct calculation of '. The bootstrapping method was
              | used to find the 5% and 95% confidence integrals by resampling the patch-averaged
              | dissipation rates associated with each wave breaking event at a particular wave phase.
              | The associated uncertainty is only ±15 − 30% of the patch-averaged dissipation rate.
              | Thus despite ensemble averaging only 6 wave events, the breaking events are quite
              | repeatable and the uncertainty due to a limited number of realizations is small relative
              | to the uncertainty due to the resolution of the velocity field discussed earlier. Here,

text          |    The scales LK and LO illustrate how the range of length scales in the flow is

              | scales. The two measures of observed length scales in the flow, LT and LE fall between
              | these bounds. As expected, both measures of the density overturns LT and LE are
              | close in magnitude (Itsweire, 1984). For grid-generated, stratified turbulence, the
              | characteristic overturn scales LT and LE tend to grow with distance from the grid (a
              | proxy for time since generation), until reaching LO , at which point LT and LE tend to
              | decrease (Itsweire et al., 1986). In grid turbulence experiments, the onset of buoyancy
              | effects was found to occur when LT = 0.8LO (Itsweire et al., 1986). Here, LT and
              | LE grow quickly with LO as the wave initially breaks. At t/T ≈ 0.2, it appears that
              | the growth of LT is restricted by the stratification, and then LT subsequently decays
              | with LO . Itsweire et al. (1986) report the extinction of turbulence when LT = 7.8LK ,

              | is less than the critical value required to sustain a constant level of turbulent kinetic

text          | The evolution of the turbulence in the overturning patch over time may give an
              | indication of how the turbulence was generated. Figure 5.9 shows the evolution
              | of the turbulence intensity, '/(νN 2 ). The evolution of '/(νN 2 ) over the buoyancy
              | time scale, (N/2π)t, in the breaking event behaves very similarly to the decaying,
              | stratified turbulence in the numerical simulations of Venayagamoorthy & Stretch
              | (2006). There appears to be an initial pulse of turbulent kinetic energy production,
              | and then subsequent decay of that turbulent pulse. A train of propagating interfacial
              | waves leads to an oscillatory shear imposed at a given location, thus the time scale
              | of the imposed shear is set by the wave frequency, ω. The relatively short time
              | scale of interfacial wave shear does not sustain the turbulent patch for very long
              | here. The lower frequency wave breaking events observed in Hult et al. (2009) led
              | to what appeared to be a longer period of active turbulence. Thus, the wave time
              | scale relative to the stratification time scale, ω/N, may play a role in the mixing

              | from small scales to larger scales as neighboring eddies pair and combine over time,
              | leading to a decrease in LO /LT and F rs with the evolution of a turbulent patch in
              | time (Gibson, 1980, 1986; Leung & Gibson, 2004). While F rs shows a slight increase
              | with time here, the increase was smaller than the increase in F rs observed by Smyth
              | et al. (2001). Due to the relatively short time scale of the wave compared to the time

              | patch, F rK varies little over the course of the breaking event, with 0.5 < F rK < 0.9
              | for the more active portion of the wave period (0.1 < t/T < 0.5). This formulation of
              | the Froude number does not show the same upward trend as F rt and F rs , suggesting
              | F rk may be less sensitive to changing mixing conditions. Here, F rt may be larger
              | than F rs due to the imperfect method for extracting the turbulent velocity, u, from

text          |    For the Froude number scaling, F rt = u/LN , u is taken to be the wave velocity,
              | aω, and L is a length scale of overturning. For simplicity, let’s assume the initial wave
              | instability is due primarily to interfacial shear. Following Troy & Koseff (2005b), in
              | the long wave limit, the maximum growth rate occurs for perturbations of length scale,
              | λs ∼ 2.5δ where δ is the interfacial thickness. This shear instability perturbation
              | length scale is taken to be the relevant initial turbulent length scale, L ∼ 2.5δ. At
              | this point, if the velocity gradient is approximated ∂u/∂z ∼ 2aω/δ, then the Froude
              | number can be written as a function of the gradient Richardson number:

text          | If wave breaking occurs when Rig = 0.1 − 0.25 (Troy & Koseff, 2005b; Hult et al.,
              | 2009), this corresponds with F rt ∼ 0.4 − 0.6. If the instead we assume the wave
              | instability is convective in nature, instability occurs when the local velocity exceeds
              | the wave phase speed, so u can be scaled by (g #h1 )1/2 for small kh1 . Here, the relevant
              | buoyancy scaling would be set by the effective gravity and a, the length scale of the
              | density perturbations: N ∼ (g # /a)1/2 . Therefore, F rt = u/LN ∼ (a/h1 )−1/2 . Various
              | interfacial wave studies have observed a breaking transition when a/h1 ≈ 0.4, which
              | corresponds to wave breaking when F rt ∼ 1.6. Thus, this simple scaling analysis is

              |    What then does this mean for the mixing efficiency within the overturning patch?
              | According to the Ivey & Imberger (1991) parameterization, the mixing efficiency

              | shown in figure 5.12(a). Only the first 7 of 16 time points are shown because for
              | t/T > 0.5, the median value Ret within the patch is less than 10. The Shih et al.
              | (2005) parameterization, on the other hand, indicates that the overturning patch
              | remains in the most efficient zone where Rf = 0.17, since 7 < '/(νN 2 ) < 100 for this

text          | How does the overall efficiency obtained from integrating local measurements compare
              | with the overall efficiency from the control volume experiments of Chapter 4? From
              | figure 5.6, the energy dissipated within the patch is approximately 40% of the total
              | turbulent kinetic energy dissipated in the vicinity of the ridge. The Ivey & Imberger
              | (1991) parameterization suggests that based on the Froude number, F rs , the local ef-
              | ficiency within the patch is Rf ≈ 0.1, whereas the Shih et al. (2005) parameterization
              | suggests Rf ≈ 0.17, based on '/(νN 2 ) within the patch. Since there are essentially
              | no density gradients within the upper and lower layers, the local efficiency within
              | these regions is approximately zero. Thus the overall efficiency for the breaking event
              | would be approximately 0.4 × Rf,patch ≈ 4 − 7%. This estimate is consistent with the
              | overall efficiency measured in Chapter 4 of 5% for this wave amplitude, and 3 − 8%
              | over a range of wave amplitudes.
              |    Because of the large difference between the local efficiency within the patch at the
              | interface and the local efficiency within the lower layer, it is important to consider
              | what factors influence how much energy is dissipated within each region. Recent field
              | observations (Bogucki et al., 1997) numerical simulations (Diamessis & Redekopp,

title         | 5.5         Summary
text          | Direct calculation of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate from PIV velocity
              | data at a resolution of ∆x/LK ≈ 3 appears to underestimate the actual dissipation
              | rate by about a factor of 10. Here, the actual dissipation rate is estimated by scaling
              | ' calculated directly to be consistent with measurements of the overall change in wave
              | energy due to the breaking event from Chapter 4. The result was a map of where
              | dissipation occurred spatially over the course of the wave breaking event.
              |    In the wave-ridge interaction, two areas of elevated dissipation were apparent: an
              | overturning patch in the interfacial region and a region just upstream of the ridge
              | crest within the lower layer where the wave flow may separate from the ridge. The
              | turbulence in the overturning patch appears be forced over a short time scale, and then
              | subsequently decays. Within the overturning patch, the overturning length scale, LT ,
              | appears to grow quickly to the size of the Ozmidov scale, LO , and then decrease with
              | LO as the turbulence intensity, '/(νN 2 ), decreases. The time scale of the wave forcing
              | relative to the stratification, ω/N, may influence the evolution of the turbulence.
              |    While it is not possible to calculate the local mixing efficiency directly from this
              | data set, the spatial variability of the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy and scalar
              | gradients as well as the evolution of turbulent length scales can be use to characterize
              | the mixing processes within wave breaking event. Turbulent kinetic energy is dissi-
              | pated within the relatively homogeneous lower layer, however there are essentially no
              | density gradients to mix in this region. Thus the local mixing efficiency within the

text          | Oceanic observations (e.g., Polzin et al., 1997) suggest the slope of bottom bathymetry

              | reported for deep water interfacial wave breaking (Fringer and Street 2003). This

text          | The results of Chapter 4 and 5 suggest that the overall efficiency of waves breaking
              | at the ridge is quite low, in part due to the development of turbulence within the
              | essentially homogenous lower layer. Would the overall efficiency increase if, instead
              | of a strictly two-layer system, a more continuous stratification was present? The
              | results of Ivey and Nokes (1989) indicate that in the limit of a linear stratification,
              | the overall efficiency for internal waves breaking at a slope can be as high as 20%,
              | depending on the ratio of the wave to topographic slope. The stratification within
              | the lower layer could be increased to investigate the impact on event efficiency, either
              | through numerical or laboratory investigations. In the lab, these experiments would
              | require altering the stratification procedure and possibly the wave forcing.
              |    Only the wave amplitude was varied in the overall event efficiency experiments,
              | while the forcing frequency and the interfacial height relative to the ridge were kept
              | constant. For lower frequency waves, the turbulence appears to be forced over a
              | longer time, as strong flow backward over the ridge leads to a sustained churning flow
              | just upstream of the ridge (see figure 3.2(c)). The overall efficiency may be quite
              | different for this flow, although it is more difficult to estimate the energy budget for
              | lower frequency waves due very high reflection from the ridge.

text          | A ground truth for the dissipation rates is needed. The correction factor method
              | is not ideal, for the assumptions are not always met with respect to the assumed
              | turbulent spectrum and the velocity error must be known quite accurately. As a
              | result, while the correction factor can reduce the error in the dissipation rate, the
              | uncertainty may still be quite large. Tanaka and Eaton (2007) argue that to measure
              | dissipation directly, the required resolution is 0.1 < ∆x/LK < 0.6, a more stringent
              | requirement than previous studies. To reach ∆x/LK = 0.6, the spatial resolution
              | ∆x would have to be reduced by a factor of 8. With the existing equipment in the
              | EFML, it is feasible that such resolution could be achieved for these internal wave
              | flows. The biggest limitation appears to be the particle seeding density in the flow.
              | For the experiments discussed in Chapter 5, the seeding density in the lower layer
              | was at or below the acceptable lower limit (Fincham & Spedding, 1997). Thus, the
              | seeding density would have to be at least 8 times higher. Based on initial testing to
              | increase particle seeding density, the seeding density could easily be increased by a
              | factor of 2. Beyond that point, there was substantial attenuation in the light sheet,
              | due to the seeding. Although the field of view would be limited to 1-2cm for such
              | experiments, the results could be used to validate the correction factors presented in
              | Chapter 5. With multiple cameras, it might be possible to estimate the dissipation
              | rate from structure functions as well, for comparison (e.g., Variano & Cowen, 2008).

              | wave forcing conditions and examine the effect on the the local mixing conditions.
              | Adjusting the scaled amplitude, a/hr , may increase the intensity of the turbulence. As
              | mentioned above, decreasing the forcing frequency appears to lead to a more sustained
              | turbulent forcing, compared to the short burst of forcing in the wave breaking in
              | Chapter 5.
              |    Simultaneous PIV and PLIF measurements provide the opportunity to test pa-
              | rameterizations based on relationships between ' and χ. The challenge is to resolve
              | both quantities sufficiently. Even if the entire range of scales of velocity and salinity
              | variance cannot be resolved, spatial spectra could be analyzed to further investigate
              | the relationship between these two quantities during internal wave breaking events.
              | The correction factor approach in Chapter 5 and Appendix A could also be applied
              | to scalar variance data. A fast response CT probe could also be used to estimate the
              | dissipation rate from scalar gradients, for comparison (Ivey et al., 2000).
              |    After the initial instability, the turbulent patch appears to move downstream in
              | the direction of the propagating wave at a speed just less than the phase speed of the
              | wave, but faster than the stokes drift velocity. Further study is needed to determine
              | whether the moving turbulent patch is due to the advection of the mixed fluid, or
              | whether the patch location shifts because new mixed fluid is generated at the crest
              | where the shear is high.
              |    Some very preliminary dye injection experiments were conducted to examine how
              | breaking waves enhanced the diffusivity near the ridge. A small pulse of dye was
              | injected into the quiescent tank, near upstream slope of the ridge. While waves broke
              | at the ridge, the dye was sheared by the waves and entrained in the separation vortex.
              | Traces of dye that neared the interfacial turbulent patch were quickly mixed out. From
              | these experiments, it was clear that a simple, uniform diffusivity would not accurately
              | describe how breaking waves mixed the flow. Such dye injection experiments may be
              | useful to quantify the extent to which the breaking events enhance mixing and modify
              | transport in the flow.

text          | Subsampling the exact velocity signal u(x) acts to smooth out variation on spatial
              | scales smaller than the discrete sampling resolution. For a given specified dissipation
              | rate and spatial resolution, there may be significant sub-grid variation in the velocity
              | signal, as shown in figure A.4(a). Note, however, that as the spatial resolution is
              | reduced, error due to measurement noise increases, as discussed in Chapter 5. Mea-

              | the model data in the numerical derivative calculations. The exact velocity deriva-
              | tive captures variation across all length scales, whereas the accuracy of numerical
              | derivative schemes dependent on the spatial resolution. The numerical differentiation
              | scheme recommended by Raffel et al. (1998) for PIV data is:

text          | for grid spacing ∆x. In figure A.4(b), it is clear that this stencil smooths the numerical
              | derivative more than the central or backward difference schemes, by weighting the
              | outer points in the stencil. Although central difference scheme may match the exact
              | gradient more closely, the noise floor from measurement noise is much higher in regions
              | where the actual dissipation rate is low. In this study, the Raffel et al. scheme
              | appears to be better for distinguishing actual dissipation from noise by smoothing
              | out variation on very short spatial scales.

text          | The advantage of working with modeled turbulence instead of actual turbulence is
              | that since u(x) is the sum of sine functions and du/dx is known exactly, the dissipation
              | rate from the equation above is exact for that realization of u(x). This exact rate
              | can be compared with the dissipation rate calculated from the subsampled version
              | of u(x). Then, it becomes very straightforward to investigate the impact of different
              | experimental parameters on the ‘measured’ dissipation rate. For example, effect of
              | varying spatial resolution, ∆x, measurement noise, eu , or dissipation rate 'actual , could
              | be examined. Because the interest here was how to correct the measured data set,
              | the spatial resolution and measurement noise were held constant.
              |    Figure A.5 shows how the measured dissipation rate 'measured compares with the
              | exact dissipation rate 'actual , for different numerical differentiation methods. Differen-
              | tiation schemes include backward difference, first order central difference (‘central’),
              | a higher order central difference scheme (‘higher’), the scheme from equation A.4
              | recommended for PIV by Raffel et al. (1998), and a correction scheme developed by
              | Tanaka and Eaton (2007). Note, before calculating the gradients a spatial filter was
              | applied to the velocity data series to be consistent with the 50% overlap in the PIV
              | processing sub-windows, which leads to the different schemes giving more similar re-
              | sults that in the absence of any velocity filtering. As seen in figure A.5, in the limit
              | where 'actual is low, measurement noise is dominant, and all schemes overestimate the
              | actual dissipation rate and asymptote to a constant value. For the highest values of
              | 'actual , all schemes underestimate the actual dissipation rate. As 'actual increases, the
              | Kolmogorov scale becomes smaller (LK = (ν 3 /')1/4 ) while the spatial resolution is
              | fixed, thus the full dissipative range of scales is not resolved. The standard practice
              | in an experiment attempting to calculate the dissipation rate directly from spatial
              | velocity gradients is to set the spatial resolution to be on the order of the expected

              | applying such a correction factor approach, and thus the uncertainty in the resulting

              | spatial resolution 2∆x for '(p, q)m |2∆x and spatial resolution ∆x for '(p, q)m |∆x . Here,
              | γ = (eu (p, q)2 ). Note, this correction method requires a high spatial resolution so that
              | the truncation error O(∆x2 ) is small. Tanaka and Eaton used synthetic turbulence
              | generated by the superposition of vortices to determine the resolution criterion for
              | calculating dissipation directly from PIV measurements. While Tanaka and Eaton
              | did not discuss the energy spectrum of their synthetic turbulence, their suggested
              | resolution requirement is consistent with the results found here using the spectral
              | method correction. Tanaka and Eaton state that a resolution of 0.1 < ∆x/LK < 0.6
              | is necessary to measure ' from PIV measurements.
              |    If the resolution for the model data set is changed to ∆x = 0.06mm, the resulting
              | measured verses actual dissipation rates are shown in figure A.7. The results indicate
              | that when ∆x/LK ≈ 0.3, the direct calculation is an accurate reflection of the actual
              | dissipation rate. The lowest spatial resolution feasible with existing EFML equipment
              | is probably ∆x ≈ 0.2mm, or about a factor of 5 smaller than the resolution of the
              | data in this study. The limiting factors are the thickness of the light sheet and the
              | extremely high particle seeding density required at such resolution. The laser power
              | is significantly weakened with high concentrations of seeding particles in the fluid.
              | Therefore, error in the direct calculation of dissipation rates could most likely be
              | reduced further by changing the experimental set-up.
