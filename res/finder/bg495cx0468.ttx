blank         | 
text          | The cornea provides the protective outer covering of the eye. Its almost perfect
              | transparency allows light to pass through it with little loss and its external curvature
              | and refractive index are responsible for most of the bending of light rays needed
              | to focus light on the retina. In the simplest terms, the cornea is a fiber-reinforced
              | fluid shell that supports the intraocular pressure (IOP) applied on its inner surface.
              | Recent developments in imaging the organization of collagen fibers throughout the
              | cornea have provided a quantification of collagen distributions that shed light on how
              | the collagen maintains the cornea’s shape and provides elastic resiliency. In addition
              | to the collagen, another defining feature of the cornea is its high water content.
              | The tissue hydration level plays a vital role in transparency, with deviations from
              | normal resulting in corneal opacity. The interfibrillar water supports the tissue fluid
              | pressure which has both hydrostatic (IOP) and osmotic pressure components, and
              | the osmotic pressure is actively modulated to control tissue hydration. In this thesis
              | a comprehensive model for these elements of tissue behavior is introduced with the
              | goal of providing a predictive model for the living human cornea.
              |    Common defects in corneal shape lead to refractive errors (e.g. astigmatism).
              | But most sources of refractive error do not have their prime origin in the cornea
              | (e.g. myopia, hyperopia and presbyopia). However, in case of corneal disease such
              | as keratoconus, refractive disruption due to corneal reshaping can be extreme. The
              | surgical accessibility of the cornea makes it a desirable target for surgical correction
              | of many refractive conditions, and not only those arising in the cornea. As a result,
              | surgeons have great interests in being able to accurately predict changes in corneal
              | curvature resulting from a wide range of surgical procedures, in which tissue is cut,

              | troduced. The list of surgical approaches is remarkably long and ever-increasing; this
              | is an area of active innovation. In this thesis, a first-principles approach to modeling
              | the biomechanics of the cornea is presented and is demonstrated to extend current
              | predictive capabilities for refractive procedures.
              |    The research described in this thesis is organized into three major areas. (1) The
              | active hydration control mechanism in the living cornea and its interaction with the
              | collagen architecture, (2) the force mechanisms that maintain the regular order of the
              | collagen fibrils within the stroma which are necessary for corneal transparency and (3)
              | the influence of metabolic species on osmotic pressure, and the relationship between
              | corneal edema and metabolic processes under normal and pathological conditions.
              |    For the studies of collagen-swelling interaction, we propose a structural model
              | of the in vivo cornea, which accounts for tissue swelling behavior and the three-
              | dimensional organization of stromal fibers. The cornea is modeled as an electrolyte gel
              | in which the osmotic pressure is modulated by the active endothelial ionic transport.
              | The stromal fiber elasticity is modeled based on three-dimensional collagen orientation
              | probability distributions for every point in the stroma obtained by synthesizing x-
              | ray diffraction data and second harmonic-generated imaging data. The model is
              | implemented in a finite element framework and employed to study the effect of fiber
              | inclination in stabilizing the corneal refractive surface with respect to changes in
              | tissue hydration and IOP.
              |    The transparency of the human cornea depends on the pseudohexagonal arrange-
              | ment of the collagen fibrils and on the maintenance of an optimal hydration – the
              | achievement of both depends on the presence of negatively charged glycosaminogly-
              | cans (GAGs). While the GAGs produce osmotic pressure by Donnan effect, the
              | means by which they exert positional control of the fibril arrangement is less clear.
              | In this thesis, a theoretical model based on equilibrium thermodynamics is proposed
              | to describe restoring force mechanisms that may control and maintain the fibril ar-
              | rangement. Electrostatic-based restoring forces that result from local charge density
              | changes induced by fibril motion, and entropic elastic restoring forces that arise from
              | duplexed GAG structures that bridge neighboring fibrils, are described. A striking

              | based distribution function of fibrils for the human cornea, and thus maintain the
              | short-range order of the lattice-like fibril arrangement.
              |    The cornea contains cells, which require nutrient supply from the aqueous humor
              | to maintain their metabolic activities. Disturbances in metabolite concentrations
              | can cause corneal edema and result in loss of corneal transparency. In order to
              | study the relationship between metabolic processes and corneal edema, we introduce
              | a chemo-electro-mechanical model based on balance equations for the stromal fluid
              | and metabolic species. The model describes interactions among metabolic species,
              | charged GAGs and other mobile ions. The model is employed to predict corneal
              | swelling with an intrastromal inlay for refractive correction of presbyopia. The results
              | provide comprehensive explanations for clinical observations, and demonstrate the
              | predictive capabilities of the proposed theory for refractive procedures.

text          | First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor Prof. Peter M. Pinsky. It has
              | been an honor working with him in the past six years. I thank him for guiding me
              | to think creatively and critically and for training me to develop a vision in scientific
              | research. I appreciate all his contributions of time, ideas and effort to make my
              | Ph.D study inspiring and productive. The attitude and approach he has towards
              | scientific problems have made a profound impact on my way of thinking and studying.
              | From working with me through my first publication, to giving me advice on how to
              | explore future research directions, Prof. Pinsky has been teaching me both consciously
              | and unconsciously. Without his wisdom, guidance and support, it would have been
              | impossible for me to accomplish this work.
              |    I would like to thank Prof. Wei Cai and Prof. Ellen Kuhl for serving on my

              |        described by the swelling pressure Ps . In healthy cornea, the swelling
              |        is countered by the continuous removal of bicarbonate ions from the
              |        stroma by pumps located in the endothelium and which results in a
              |        stable stromal hydration. (b) An illustration of the organization of

              |        Collagen fibrils within lamellae are found in parallel arrays following
              |        the fibril direction; each lamella makes a large angle with its immediate
              |        neighbors and keratocyte cells are found interspersed between adjacent
              |        lamellae. (c) An idealized cross-section through a lamella showing a
              |        hexagonal collagen fibril lattice; the irregular lines between the fibrils

              |        analysis is indicated by the red-triangle. (d) The unit cell domain is
              |        partitioned into fibril, coating and interstitial regions, denoted Ωfibril ,
              |        Ωcoat and Ωinterstitial , respectively.    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   11

              |       duplex. Each GAG chain is attached at one end to a collagen fibril
              |       via its PG core protein. The end-to-end distance Li of the antiparallel

              |       pair. The antiparallel GAG duplex structures are assumed to lie in a

text          | 5.1   The electrostatic restoring force mechanism which acts on fibrils to main-
              |       tain their regular organization is illustrated for the case where all fibrils are
              |       held fixed in their lattice positions and a single fibril is displaced relative
              |       to its equilibrium position. (a) Shows a set of fibrils in a hexagonal lat-
              |       tice arrangement with their associated GAG chains and a distribution of
              |       mobile ions. In this situation, which corresponds to normal physiological
              |       conditions, the osmotic pressure is essentially uniform. (b) Depicts the os-
              |       motic pressure in each subcell around the undisturbed fibril. The osmotic
              |       pressure in each subcell exerts a force on the fibril (see equation (5.5)) but
              |       because the osmotic pressure is uniform, all six forces balance and the net
              |       force is zero, as indicated by the red dot. (c) Shows a fibril displaced from
              |       its equilibrium position. The GAG chains attached to the fibril move with
              |       the fibril and the GAG fixed charge density and mobile ion concentration
              |       increase in advance of the fibril displacement and reduce behind it. (d)
              |       Indicates the resulting osmotic pressure in each of the subcells, which is
              |       higher where GAG fixed charge density has increased and lower where it
              |       has reduced. The forces exerted by each of the subcells now has changed
              |       magnitude with the result that a net force acts on the fibril with a direction
              |       oriented toward its original position. This restoring force is shown as a red
              |       arrow. This mechanism, which exploits the stromal collagen-GAG organiza-
              |       tion, operates regardless of the direction of the perturbation and regardless
              |       of whether GAG chains are part of a duplex or are independent. When
              |       any fibril undergoes a dynamic excursion from its equilibrium position, the

text          | The cornea, the transparent front portion of the corneoscleral shell, provides a smooth
              | refractive interface, has excellent light transmission properties, and is a resilient struc-
              | ture that protects the intraocular components of the eye (Meek, 2008). It is a mul-
              | tilayered tissue consisting of an anterior epithelium, a resilient collagenous stroma,
              | and a posterior leaky layer of endothelial cells (Maurice, 1962). The tissue exhibits
              | remarkable strength and transparency, with both properties deriving from the highly
              | organized micro- and nanoscale structure of the cornea. On the microscale, the stroma
              | consists of approximately 350 lamellae (flattened fibers) stacked through its thickness
              | and containing type I/V 25 nm diameter collagen fibrils. The architecture of the
              | fibers is complex, exhibiting preferred directions in the corneal plane and interweav-
              | ing through the thickness (Meek et al., 1987; Winkler et al., 2011). In effect, the
              | lamellae create a three-dimensional structural system which resists the intraocular
              | pressure and shapes the cornea. On the nanoscale, proteoglycans (PGs) occupy the
              | interfibrillar space and are believed to provide forces which are needed to impose the
              | ordered spacing of the collagen fibrils necessary for transparency. The PGs carry fixed
              | charges which interact with the mobile ions in the interfibrillar water and produce
              | the tissue osmotic pressure (Elliott and Hodson, 1998; Hodson, 1971). In the living
              | cornea, the osmotic pressure is modulated by the active endothelial ionic transport
              | processes. Understanding the interactions among these elements is essential to ex-
              | plain how the cornea maintains its principal functionalities. There is yet no consensus

text          | on many of the biophysical details. In this thesis, a comprehensive model based on
              | biophysical descriptions of tissue behavior is introduced with the goal of providing a
              | predictive model for the living human cornea.
              |    Pathological conditions alter the shape and transparency of the cornea, and thus
              | result in blurred vision or blindness. In fact, corneal disease or injury is the sec-
              | ond leading cause of vision loss and affects more than 10 million people worldwide
              | (Ruberti and Zieske, 2008; Whitcher et al., 2001). In addition to external factors
              | such as ocular trauma, many diseases result in degeneration or dysfunction of the
              | cornea’s internal components. For example, Fuch’s dystrophy, keratoconus and mac-
              | ular corneal dystrophy are induced by malfunctions of the endothelium (Elhalis et al.,
              | 2010), collagen fibers (Ambekara et al., 2011), and stromal PGs (Hassell et al., 2011),
              | respectively. In particular, Fuch’s dystrophy is the most common dystrophic cause
              | for corneal transplantation (Elhalis et al., 2010). In this disease, an accelerated loss
              | of endothelial cells affects the active ionic transport and causes the cornea to swell by
              | imbibing water from the anterior chamber of the eye. Understanding how the corneal
              | tissue behaves under this and many other pathological conditions is important for
              | both scientific and clinical interests, and is an active area of research.
              |    The cornea is a desirable target for surgical correction because of its accessibility,
              | even for vision defects that do not have their prime origin in the cornea (e.g. my-
              | opia, hyperopia and presbyopia). Refractive surgeries modify the corneal curvature
              | by cutting, removing, adding or redistributing stromal tissues (Netto et al., 2005), or
              | by introducing synthetic implants (Burris, 1998). One of the most commonly used
              | refractive surgeries is laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) (Solomon et al.,
              | 2009). This procedure creates an anterior corneal flap and modifies the cornea’s
              | curvature by ablating the stromal bed. Many similar techniques have been devel-
              | oped, including photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and more recently, small-incision
              | lenticule extraction (SMILE) (Dong et al., 2014). These surgical procedures not only
              | change the shape of the cornea, but also modify the biomechanical properties of the
              | tissue. As a result, the cornea will have a biomechanical response to surgery, which
              | causes the final shape of the cornea to differ from the designed cut profile (Ortiz et al.,
              | 2008). For better performance of refractive procedures, surgeons have great interest

text          | in being able to accurately predict changes of corneal curvature resulting from the
              | surgical operations. In this thesis, a first-principles approach to modeling the biome-
              | chanics of the cornea is presented and is demonstrated to extend current predictive
              | capabilities for refractive procedures.
              |    To describe the biomechanical behavior of the cornea in normal, pathological or
              | surgical conditions, numerical models must consider the two defining features of the
              | tissue - the collagen fiber organization and the interfibrillar electrolyte. The devel-
              | opment of computational models for the cornea has a long history and has achieved
              | significant advancement in characterizing its anisotropic fiber organization (Pandolfi
              | and Holzapfel, 2008; Petsche and Pinsky, 2013; Pinsky and Datye, 1992; Pinsky et al.,
              | 2005; Studer et al., 2010; Vito et al., 1989; Woo et al., 1972). However, the electrolyte
              | feature of the cornea has been ignored - current finite element models treat the inter-
              | fibrillar water as an incompressible or nearly incompressible elastic solid. In contrast,
              | water is the principal component of the cornea and is free to flow into or out of the
              | stroma via its leaky posterior membrane. The electrolyte nature of the tissue is well
              | illustrated by its remarkable capacity for swelling when immersed in water or dilute
              | salt solution (Hedbys and Dohlman, 1963; Olsen and Sperling, 1987). Because exist-
              | ing models are not constructed based on this view, they cannot describe the swelling
              | behavior, which is a crucial aspect in determining corneal shape and hydration. In this
              | thesis, a novel continuum mechanics framework is proposed to account for the tissue
              | swelling behavior, for the stromal fibers and for the collagen-swelling interactions.
              |    The transparency of the human cornea depends on the precise maintenance of an
              | optimal hydration and on the quasi-regular arrangement of the collagen fibrils within
              | the stromal lamellae (Benedek, 1971). While the hydration control mechanism is
              | attributed to the active endothelial ionic transport (Bonanno, 2012; Maurice, 1972),
              | the mechanisms that maintain the collagen fibril arrangement is unclear. Experi-
              | mental studies indicated that the PG-GAG molecule plays crucial roles in providing
              | positional control of the fibril arrangement (Hayashida et al., 2006; Maurice, 1957).
              | However, no prior theories but a few speculations have been proposed to clarify such
              | controlling mechanism on the fibril arrangement (Lewis et al., 2010; Maurice, 1957).
              | This thesis extends the proposed electrolyte model to study the interfibrillar force

text          | mechanisms which give rise to the short-range order fibril arrangement that underlies
              | the transparency. Illustrating such mechanism is not only an academic challenge, but
              | will provide an improved understanding of corneal biomechanics that will be useful
              | in tissue engineering applications (Ruberti and Zieske, 2008).
              |    The cornea contains living and reproducing cells, which require nutrient supply
              | from the aqueous humor to maintain their metabolic activities. The flows of these
              | metabolic species are subtle and complex (Chhabra et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2011),
              | and disturbing them can affect the cells’ viabilities and cause local hydration im-
              | balance. A well documented situation along this line is the occurrence of corneal
              | swelling under contact lens wear. In such case, the lens blocks the oxygen flow from
              | the air and causes accumulation of metabolic products, which leads to increase of
              | osmotic pressure (Klyce, 1981). More recently, there is an increasing clinical interests
              | in studying changes of metabolites concentrations due to the introduction of corneal
              | implants such as intrastromal inlay (Pinsky, 2014) and intrastromal ring Cochener
              | et al. (2000). To understand the transport of metabolic species and its roles in af-
              | fecting corneal hydration, we must consider the cornea as a polyelectrolyte with salt
              | ions, nutrients and metabolic products. Recently, several stromal transport models
              | have been proposed to characterize the hydration distribution in the cornea (Li and
              | Tighe, 2006), and its variations due to the change of metabolic reactions (Leung et al.,
              | 2011). However, these models rely on empirical expressions for the swelling pressure,
              | ignore the effects of the collagen network and the PG charges, and are restricted to a
              | one-dimensional situation. A more complete understanding based on the biophysical
              | components of the tissue is still missing.
              |    As noted above, there are numerous outstanding open questions in corneal biome-
              | chanics, including (i) How does the living cornea generate and regulate swelling pres-
              | sure, (ii) How does the collagen architecture interact with swelling and influence the
              | stability of refractive surfaces, (iii) How does the cornea maintain the regular order of
              | the collagen fibrils within the stroma which is necessary for transparency, (iv) What
              | is the influence of metabolic species on the tissue swelling behavior, and (v) What is
              | the relationship between corneal edema and metabolic processes? This thesis intends
              | to answer these questions by the development a comprehensive model that builds on

              |    The thesis is organized as follows. In chapter 2, we propose a theoretical model
              | based on thermodynamic equilibrium to describe the swelling behavior of the ex vivo
              | cornea. This model characterizes the electrolyte free energy derived from the GAG
              | distribution on nanoscale. The derivation of the stromal swelling pressure is validated
              | against published experimental measurements. Extension of this thermodynamic ap-
              | proach to the in vivo cornea is presented in chapter 3, which takes account for the
              | active endothelial ionic transport. The model provides a new interpretation of ac-
              | tive hydration control mechanism based on osmotic pressure modulation. With the
              | statement of electrostatic free energy for the in vivo cornea, a structural model is
              | proposed in chapter 4 to describe the collagen-swelling interactions in pathological
              | and surgical conditions. Case studies are presented regarding to the corneal behaviors
              | in free-swelling experiments (section 4.3.2), in Fuch’s dystrophy (section 4.3.3) and
              | after LASIK surgeries (section 4.3.5). The results illustrate the structural necessity
              | of the collagen architecture in stabilizing the corneal refractive surface with respect
              | to changes in tissue hydration. In chapter 5, we extend the proposed thermodynamic
              | framework to describe the possible force mechanisms that maintain the lattice-like
              | arrangement of the collagen fibrils. A new osmotic-based force is proposed based
              | on the collagen-PG configurations, and is validated by reproducing the image-based
              | fibril distribution function for the human cornea. In chapter 6, we return to the dis-

title         | 2.1     Background
text          | The stromal PGs are sulphated and have linear sidechains of negatively charged
              | disaccharide units called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that are bound covalently at
              | one end to a PG core protein which is attached to a collagen fibril (Lewis et al.,
              | 2010). The charged GAG chains interact electrostatically with ions in the interfibrillar
              | fluid to produce osmotic pressure. The resulting propensity of the stroma to swell
              | by absorbing water is counteracted in the in vivo cornea by an active ion transport
              | mechanism located in the endothelial cellular layer (Maurice, 1972). It is through the
              | interplay of the GAG-based osmotic pressure and the active ion pumping mechanisms
              | that hydration in the in vivo cornea is controlled. A measure of the overall swelling
              | tendency of stroma in vitro, which includes osmotic and other effects, is provided by
              | the tissue swelling pressure which has been measured by numerous investigators, e.g.
              | Hedbys and Dohlman (1963), and Olsen and Sperling (1987).
              |    In this chapter, we follow a conventional equilibrium thermodynamics approach
              | to characterize the free energy of the stromal electrolyte in the ex vivo cornea. We
              | employ the Poisson-Boltzmann mean-field theory to describe interactions between

              | (see chapter 5).
              |       In a theoretical study on corneal transparency, Twersky (1975) conjectured that
              | collagen fibrils must be centered in a “tough adherent transparent coating” that
              | prevents fibril aggregation, an idea that has experimental support in the work of Fratzl
              | and Daxer (1993) whose measurements suggest that collagen fibrils are surrounded
              | by a cylindrical coating consisting of PGs. The current model is used to explore
              | the biophysical roles of these PG-dense coating. It is shown that such a coating
              | will relatively have small influence on the tissue osmotic pressure, except when the

text          |    X-ray scattering studies have been used to reveal structural transformation of
              | collagen fibrils under varying tissue hydration (Fratzl and Daxer, 1993; Meek et al.,
              | 1991). Fratzl and Daxer (1993) performed X-ray scattering studies of collagen fibrils
              | under varying hydration produced by drying the tissue. Their results suggest that
              | the stromal PGs appear in relatively high density in the vicinity of the fibrils where
              | they may form a charge-rich and water-binding PG-coating surrounding each fibril.
              | The radius of the coating was measured to be rc = 18.25 nm. They showed that
              | the coating radius is insensitive to hydration over a wide range, suggesting that the
              | water bound by the coating is released only at very low levels of tissue hydration.
              | The existence of such a surface ultrastructure on the collagen fibrils is corroborated
              | by image studies from Miyagawa et al. (2001) and, to some extent, by Muller et al.
              | (2004). In particular, Miyagawa et al. (2001) has suggested that the PG-coating
              | is primarily composed of KS. A theoretical study by Twersky (1975) proposed that
              | collagen fibrils must be centered in a transparent coating and the coated fibrils occupy
              | approximately 60% of the matrix volume, giving rc = 21.56 nm.
              |    To accommodate the possibility that the collagen fibrils have coatings consisting
              | of proteoglycans, two classes of GAGs are introduced for modeling purposes (figure
              | 2.2c): (a) an interstitial class which spans the interfibrillar electrolyte volume, and
              | (b) a fibril coating class which spans a fibril coating volume. The stromal fixed charge
              | Q is partitioned with a parameter λ ∈ [0, 1] such that the fixed charge Qinter = λQ is
              | associated with the interstitial GAGs, and the charge Qcoat = (1 − λ) Q is associated
              | with the coating GAGs. The parameter λ facilitates modeling of the case with no
              | coating GAGs, λ = 1, coating and interstitial GAGs, 0 < λ < 1, and the extreme
              | (non-physiological) case of coating GAGs only, λ = 0.
              |    The coating GAGs are not explicitly identified with KS or CS/DS. However, such
              | identification can provide a lower bound on the physiological value of λ. The charge

title         | 2.3.3         Entropic elastic free energy
text          | As noted in section 2.1, Scott (1992) proposed that two or more GAG chains, each

              | which the linear chains are 180o apart, creating a bridge-like structure spanning the

              | (Hirsch et al., 2001; Lewis et al., 2010; Muller et al., 2004). It is assumed that the
              | antiparallel, duplexed GAG structures possess the free energy of a worm-like chain
              | (WLC) (Bustamante et al., 1994), providing an entropic elastic behavior arising from

              | The average stromal charge density ρ0stroma /F = 38.6 mM used in these calculations
              | was found by requiring the predicted Ps to exactly match the measured swelling
              | pressure at J = 1 (normal hydration) and λ = 0.65. Olsen and Sperling (1987)
              | provide a power law fit of their data Psexp = 7.56t−3.48 mmHg, where t is the stromal
              | thickness, and this was used to determine the physiological swelling pressure as 84.35
              | mmHg.
              |    In figure 2.5a, computed and measured swelling pressure are compared over a
              | range from swollen J = 1.5 (168% normal hydration) to compressed J = 0.55 (39%
              | normal hydration) for three values of λ. The curve for λ = 0.65 agrees by design
              | with the experimental data at J = 1, and shows excellent agreement with the data
              | over the entire range of hydration. The other two curves corresponding to λ = 1
              | and 0.3 show the effect of changing the charge partition; the solution for λ = 0.3
              | departs significantly from the experimental data. In figure 2.5b, the predicted swelling

title         | 3.1     Background
text          | The corneal endothelium is a 5 µm thin cellular monolayer located on the posterior
              | surface of the cornea. It is highly permeable to water, metabolic species, including
              | glucose and lactate ion, and other salt ions (Dawson et al., 2011).    The endothe-
              | lium plays a critical role in regulating corneal hydration. The mechanism involves
              | active ion transport across the membrane, from the stroma to the aqueous humor,
              | and the passive transport of water facilitated by special water channels. The regu-

text          | and possibly Na+ , are not yet fully understood.   From a macroscopic perspective,
              | the control of hydration has been explained by a pump-leak mechanism (Bonanno,
              | 2012; Fischbarg and Maurice, 2004; Maurice, 1972). Without active ion transport,
              | the cornea is highly hydrophilic and swells as a result of the large osmotic pressure
              | differential that exists between the stroma and aqueous humor, which acts as a bath
              | for the stromal electrolyte. This swelling tendency was modeled and analyzed in the
              | previous section. Active ion transport across the endothelium, from the stroma and
              | into the aqueous humor, will reduce ionic concentration in the stroma and the osmotic

              | is sufficiently large, fluid flow across the endothelium will cease. A hydration control
              | system is then achieved because a further small increase in active ionic flux will cause
              | the cornea to exude fluid and shrink, whereas a small reduction in active ionic flux
              | will cause the cornea to absorb fluid and swell, allowing modulation of the hydration.
              |    The mechanism has been analyzed under varying modeling assumptions, notably
              | by Bryant and McDonnell (1998); Klyce and Russell (1979); Li and Tighe (2006).
              | However, these models did not consider the full three-dimensional aspects of the
              | problem, and in particular did not account for swelling interaction with the stromal
              | collagen fibrils, which we believe to be of great importance.    The active ion fluxes
              | are not currently measurable (Bourne, 1998) and predictive modeling is challenging
              | not only because the mechanics is complex but also because a precise control cri-
              | terion is lacking. In this chapter we use a criterion based on imbibition pressure
              | measured in vivo in rabbit (Hedbys et al., 1963), since there is no data for human. To
              | allow sufficient generality, we model steady and independent anion and cation active
              | transport and measure their effects (singularly or combined) on osmotic pressure by
              | deriving a modified Boltzmann ion distribution for the stroma and the corresponding
              | electrostatic free energy density for the in vivo cornea. The aims are to explain the
              | pump-leak mechanism in a realistic modeling framework and to the characterize the

title         | 4.1     Background
text          | In the simplest terms, the cornea is a fiber-reinforced fluid membrane, which resists
              | the intraocular pressure (IOP) applied on its internal boundary. Its tensile strength
              | derives from the three-dimensional organization of collagen fibers and its bulk prop-
              | erties derive from the interfibrillar fluid pressure. The fluid pressure depends on both
              | the IOP and the tissue osmotic pressure. The osmotic pressure causes the cornea to
              | have a tendency to swell by imbibing water from the adjacent anterior chamber of the
              | eye (Elliott and Hodson, 1998; Hodson, 1971). In the in vivo cornea, the osmotic pres-

              | worthy that current finite element-based models for structural analysis of the cornea
              | treat the interfibrillar fluid as an incompressible or nearly-incompressible elastic solid
              | (Pandolfi and Holzapfel, 2008; Petsche and Pinsky, 2013; Pinsky et al., 2005; Studer
              | et al., 2010). While this approach is convenient, it cannot describe swelling behavior
              | or (steady-state) bulk compressibility. The goal of the present work is to present a
              | mathematical description of the corneal stroma as an electrolyte gel, characterizing
              | the fluid pressure, swelling behavior and collagen-swelling interaction. We show that
              | such a model can extend predictive accuracy in corneal biomechanics.
              |    The influence of collagen architecture on tissue swelling is readily demonstrated in
              | the ex vivo cornea. When a sample of human corneal stroma is immersed in deionized
              | water, the tissue undergoes extreme swelling to many times its original thickness by
              | absorbing water from the surrounding bath. However, the observed swelling is far
              | from uniform, reflecting the interaction of local swelling with the collagen network.
              | The swelling is observed to occur primarily in the thickness direction and is most
              | pronounced in the posterior region of the stroma (Kikkawa and Hirayama, 1970; Lee
              | and Wilson, 1981; Meek et al., 2003; Muller et al., 2001). An analogous situation also
              | occurs in the in vivo swollen cornea (Brunette et al., 2009). This observed rigidity of
              | the anterior cornea with respect to swelling under extreme hydration states has been
              | ascribed to the specific architecture of the collagen fibers (Bron, 2001; Muller et al.,
              | 2001).
              |    In the pioneering work of Klyce and Russell (1979), based on the phenomenologi-
              | cal membrane transport theory of Kedem-Katchalsky (KK) (Kedem and Katchalsky,
              | 1958), non-equilibrium fluid and ionic fluxes through the corneal stroma and endothe-
              | lium were modeled and time-dependent swelling resulting from osmotic perturbations
              | were predicted. This work, and the related study by Ruberti and Klyce (2003), pro-
              | vides a theoretical confirmation that active endothelial ion transport produces an os-
              | motic gradient across the endothelium which can modulate water flow and swelling.
              | Li and Tighe (2006) later proposed an extended model which considers multiple ionic
              | species and Leung et al. (2011) have further extended the theory to include metabo-

              | not derived, but assumed as an empirical function of tissue hydration based on mea-
              | surements by Hedbys and Dohlman (1963). In the important extension by Bryant
              | and McDonnell (1998), a spherically symmetric (one-dimensional) steady-state model
              | based on the triphasic theory of Lai et al. (1991) was combined with KK theory for
              | passive and active transport across the endothelium.        This model describes ionic
              | interaction with fixed charges, fluid interaction with a solid elastic phase and ideal
              | Donnan osmotic pressure. While greatly simplifying the stromal elasticity, this model
              | does capture the full range of interactions in an elegant triphasic framework. The
              | above models are complex and it is not surprising that they do not agree for all pre-
              | dictions, for example, on the sign of the stromal fluid pressure. In the current work
              | we build on these foundational efforts but take an alternative modeling approach.
              |    In the proposed model, conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium are assumed
              | to hold, rendering water and ionic fluxes time-independent. Such an approach has
              | utility when the long-time, steady-state response of the cornea to disease processes or
              | surgical alteration is desired. While modeling based on steady-state conditions does
              | not allow the time-course of swelling to be described, it does avoid some of the high
              | complexity of non-equilibrium multi-phasic theory and the analytical simplicity of
              | the resulting theory leads to a practical and effective theory for finite element-based

              | aqueous humor (Leung et al., 2011; Li and Tighe, 2006) which acts as an ionic bath.
              | Noting that all ionic species in the stroma have the same valence value of −1, we set
              | the ionic concentration of Na+ and Cl− in the aqueous humor to C0+ = C0− = 150
              | mM and thereby account for the total molarity of all solutes in the aqueous humor,

              | The motion maps Ω0 into the current configuration Ω with deformation gradient F
              | considered uniform over the unit cell by virtue of the small unit cell size. The volume
              | of Ω is V = JV0 with J = det F. The fixed charge concentration distribution in the
              | current configuration is modeled by the function Cf (x,J) with x ∈ Ω. The fixed
              | charge concentration functions Cf 0 (X) and Cf (x,J) are developed in section 2.3.4.
              |        The reference configuration Ω0 will generally not be a stress-free configuration
              | for the solid (collagen) phase1 and it is necessary to introduce a stress-free reference
              | configuration for the solid phase, denoted S (Pinsky et al., 2005). The deformation
              | gradient F0 from S to the current configuration Ω may be multiplicatively decomposed

              | free configuration S to the current configuration Ω. The invariant I 0 1 =trC0 is used

              | this region with respect to extreme hydration changes.
              |    A theoretical study was also undertaken to confirm the importance of lamellae

              | surfaces defined with radii of 12.00 and 11.38 mm, respectively. Because the sclera
              | swells much less than the cornea (Meek, 2008), its bulk behavior was modeled as a
              | (non-swelling) compressible neo-Hookean material, as described by Petsche and Pin-

              | and non-swelling tissue, which should be replaced by use of a gradual transition (al-

title         | 4.3.4     Swelling due to changes in intraocular pressure
text          | An example of corneal edema with an intact and functional endothelium occurs in
              | acute glaucoma. In this case, elevated IOP combined with normal stromal osmotic
              | pressure can create an increase in corneal thickness (Ytteborg and Dohlman, 1965).
              | Likewise, corneal thickening is reported in patients with ocular hypertension (Herman
              | et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002).   We emphasize that we are considering the equilib-
              | rium solution that is achieved after long-time exposure to increased IOP. It is very
              | likely that the short-time non-equilibrium response of the cornea is that of elastic
              | thinning. In fact, if we model an increase in IOP and do not allow the fluid pressure
              | to equilibrate, the model does predict small corneal thinning. However, persistent
              | elevated IOP produces an increased pressure gradient which drives more fluid across
              | the endothelium, creating edema of the stroma (and epithelium), as seen in acute
              | angle-closure glaucoma (Waring et al., 1982; Ytteborg and Dohlman, 1965). This is
              | undoubtedly a simplified view of a complex problem but it is supported by predictions
              | from the current model.
              |    There are two competing mechanisms with regard to corneal swelling. The in-
              | creased (mechanical) IOP loading at the endothelial-aqueous humor interface acts to

text          | thin the cornea, but an increase in stromal fluid pressure produces a countering “infla-
              | tion” effect. At Bowman’s layer the stromal fluid pressure must be balanced by forces
              | in the inclined lamellae because there is no external pressure loading at that boundary
              | which can balance the stromal fluid pressure, see figure 4.9. As shown in figure 4.10
              | (solid curve), at 44.5 mmHg, the CCT is predicted to swell by approximately 15 µm,
              | which is in agreement with clinical data (Ytteborg and Dohlman, 1965) in which the
              | CCT was measured to be 575 and 593µm for a group of patients who had normal IOP
              | (average 15.8 mmHg) in one eye and high IOP (average 44.5 mmHg) in the other eye,
              | giving a thickness difference of 18 µm. In the simulation of increasing IOP, the active
              | ionic pumping was maintained at a normal level throughout. It is important to note
              | that other measurements, performed on eyes with retinal detachment or non-human
              | species, or performed within a relatively short time-scale, have concluded an opposite
              | trend (Ehlers, 1966; Ehlers and Riise, 1967; Johnson et al., 2007).

title         | 4.3.5     Biomechanical behavior after LASIK surgery
text          | LASIK (Laser in-Situ Keratomileusis) is commonly used to correct refractive errors
              | including myopia and hyperopia. An anterior circular hinged flap of about 150 µm
              | thickness is first created using a femtosecond laser.   The flap is then folded back
              | to expose the stromal bed which is reshaped by excimer laser ablation. The proce-
              | dure is completed by returning the flap to conform with the ablated profile. Although
              | laser ablation creates a new central corneal curvature with the goal of achieving em-
              | metropia, the biomechanical response of the residual (significantly thinned) stromal
              | tissue is an important but challenging factor that should be considered (Dupps and
              | Wilson, 2009). In this study we assume that active endothelium ionic pumping is
              | functioning normally and use the proposed model to investigate the biomechanical
              | response of the cornea, including stromal fluid pressure and local swelling, resulting

              | shape of the normo-hydrated cornea and surgical profile while the cornea is support-

              | presented by Munnerlyn et al. (1988) for an ablation radius of curvature of 8.847 mm
              | (corresponding to an intended correction of approximately −5 Diopter). The CCT
              | is 520 µm, and the maximum ablation depth of 87 µm combines with the 150 µm
              | flap to produce a residual central stromal thickness of 283 µm. With this ablation
              | profile, the residual stromal thickness is 54.4% at the cornea center and gradually
              | increases to 71.2% at the periphery of the flap. The flap is returned after ablation
              | (where negative osmotic pressure holds it in place by suction) but it is no longer me-
              | chanically integrated with the stroma and can be easily separated at any time after
              | surgery (Dupps and Wilson, 2009). LASIK therefore effectively removes that part of
              | the stroma in which lamella inclination is most pronounced (the anterior third).

              |     We analyzed the fluid pressure and swelling response of the postsurgical cornea.
              | The fluid pressure is given by p = Pos + p0 (equation (4.12)) where Pos is the osmotic
              | pressure and p0 is the bath pressure (IOP) of 15 mmHg.                   Because most inclined
              | lamellae have been removed by surgery, it may be anticipated that the fluid pressure
              | must approach zero in the anterior region of the residual stroma. Since p0 is constant,
              | this implies that the tissue will swell and the osmotic pressure will become negative
              | (see also figure 3.2a). Fluid pressure fringes are shown in the cutaway half-mesh of
              | figure 4.12a and local volume dilation fringes are shown in figure 4.12b. Figure 4.12a
              | shows that the fluid pressure reduces to approximately half of its normal value in the
              | ablation region5 . The local swelling shown in figure 4.12b is necessary to produce
              | thickness of 150 µm.

title         | 4.4      Discussion
text          | The proposed model follows the general theory for hydrophilic and highly swollen
              | polyelectrolyte gels introduced by Katchalsky and Michaeli (1955) combined with the
              | membrane transport theory of Kedem and Katchalsky (1958). The main work was
              | the characterization of the stromal electrolyte and elastic free energies, including the
              | modeling of modifications due to active endothelial ionic transport.     The resulting
              | model predicts the ex vivo (no active endothelial ionic transport) osmotic pressure and
              | osmotic compressibility with good accuracy compared to experimental measurements
              | (as described in section 4.3.1) and provides some confidence in the general framework.
              | Previous equilibrium modeling of corneal swelling by Bryant and McDonnell (1998)
              | was based on numerical solution of the spherically symmetric (one-dimensional) fluid
              | and ionic continuity equations in a multiphasic theory (Huyghe and Janssen, 1997;
              | Lai et al., 1991).   The current energy-based approach is equivalent (see appendix
              | C) in that it implies satisfaction of the same governing equations but it offers some
              | distinct advantages.

              | the triphasic theory produces a pointwise varying expression for the osmotic pres-
              | sure.     The energy approach is also convenient for describing the deviation of the
              | stromal electrolyte from ideal conditions, including electrolyte volume exclusion ef-
              | fects associated with the collagen fibrils and stromal cell (keratocyte) population.
              | Also noteworthy is the fact that the energy formulation is a natural approach for
              | finite element approximation which can be based directly on the variational forms
              | provided by the free energy terms. The proposed formulation only requires solving
              | for the displacement field, which gives practical convenience in finite element imple-
              | mentation.       The model contains numerous physical constants and parameters (see
              | reference values in table 4.1), but most are well-characterized and all simulations pre-
              | sented used these reference values – no problem-dependent parameters appear in the
              | theory.
              |       Modeling the influence of active endothelial ionic fluxes on the biophysics of
              | corneal tissue hydration in a fully three-dimensional context presents a challenge. In
              | the current approach we have analytically integrated the phenomenological Kedem-
              | Katchalsky membrane transport equations (Kedem and Katchalsky, 1958) to describe
              | the membrane osmotic gradient as a function of the active ionic fluxes and endothelial
              | ionic permeability6 .      This leads to a modified Boltzmann ionic distribution in the
              | stroma and corresponding electrostatic free energy. The effects are contained in the
              | introduced ionic transport parameters Q+ and Q− which correspond to cation and
              | anion transport, respectively. Interestingly, for a binary electrolyte the influence of
              | active ionic transport appears as a function of the combined parameter Q+ Q− . The
              | model suggests that active endothelial ionic transport reduces osmotic pressure and
              | hence swelling pressure (these are essentially equivalent in the case of the highly hy-
              | drated cornea) and the pump-leak mechanism can be explained as active pumping
              | producing a downward shift of the swelling pressure-hydration curve as discussed in
              | section 3.4 and illustrated in figure 3.2a.
              |       Precise quantification of the fluid and osmotic pressures remains an open question
              | for the human in vivo cornea, as direct measurements are not currently feasible.

text          | Conventional analysis (Klyce and Russell, 1979; Leung et al., 2011; Li and Tighe,
              | 2006) predicts a negative fluid pressure throughout the cornea. In the current study,
              | osmotic calibration based on imbibition pressure measurements for rabbit indicate a
              | positive fluid pressure at normal hydration, which is in agreement with Bryant and
              | McDonnell (1998). The calibration suggests that stromal fluid pressure must be close
              | to IOP and osmotic pressure must be close to zero. It is interesting to analyze how the
              | forces acting at the corneal bounding surfaces are balanced under these conditions.
              | The posterior stroma boundary condition, equation (4.25), may be rewritten in the
              | direction normal to the corneal posterior surface as σel −p0 −Pos = −p0 where σel is the
              | collagen effective stress component and p0 denotes the intraocular pressure. As the
              | posterior collagen fibers are parallel to the corneal surface, they can provide negligible
              | force in the transverse direction and so σel ≈ 0. Thus it may be concluded that the in
              | vivo osmotic pressure Pos must be zero at the posterior stroma – in agreement with
              | the calibration.
              |    The situation is quite different at the epithelial layer. Here there is no external
              | pressure loading to balance the stromal fluid pressure, see figure 4.9. Inclined lamellae
              | insert into Bowman’s layer (Winkler et al., 2011) where they must act to resist the
              | stromal fluid pressure applied to the epithelium. The mechanical balance equation
              | across the epithelium, equation (4.26), written in the normal direction is σel − p0 −
              | Pos = 0. Thus, the corneal anterior boundary could not be stably maintained without
              | the contribution from inclined fibers and which leads to the following hypothetical
              | question – if lamella inclination was absent how would the boundary condition then
              | be satisfied? This in essence is what occurs in LASIK where the inclined lamellae
              | are largely removed by flap creation and ablation. In this case, the effective stress
              | will become zero in the normal direction σel ≈ 0 and the in vivo cornea must swell
              | until a negative osmotic pressure is generated so that Pos = −p0 . This is precisely
              | what the model predicts in LASIK as described in section 4.3.5 (although only ˜3%
              | swelling is needed to achieve Pos = −p0 ).
              |    We have calibrated the current model for the normal living cornea by assuming
              | that GAG fixed charge is not depth-dependent; this leads to a hydration state that is

              | 
text          | also uniform with depth. It has been observed by Castoro et al. (1988) that the an-
              | terior stroma may be slightly less hydrated than the posterior. The water content of
              | these two stromal layers is measured to be 75% and 79% for rabbit, respectively (Turss
              | et al., 1971). Furthermore, biochemical studies on bovine corneas have shown that
              | posterior stroma has a higher ratio of keratan sulfate to dermatan sulfate (Castoro
              | et al., 1988). For human corneas, the depth-dependence of GAG types is unknown.
              | Given that the hydration gradient is small through the corneal depth (< 5%), it
              | seems justifiable to employ a uniform fixed charge distribution as a first approxima-
              | tion.   However, this can be easily modified as new information becomes available.
              | Likewise, flexible GAG chains, the linear macromolecular structures formed from dis-
              | accharide units, may contribute an entropic elastic energy (Cheng and Pinsky, 2013).
              | Each GAG chain is covalently bound at one end to the PG core protein and so is
              | anchored to a collagen fibril (and thereby providing fixed charges). It has been pro-
              | posed (Lewis et al., 2010; Scott, 1988) that two or more GAG chains can link to form
              | antiparallel duplex structures bridging between neighboring collagen fibrils and can
              | transmit entropic-based forces deriving from thermal motions.     Such contributions
              | can be modeled through appropriate free energy expressions but are considered to be
              | a second order effect and neglected in the current study.
              |    The stromal electrolyte free energy (equation (3.18)) is convex in the dilation
              | J and represents a rational basis for modeling the osmotic behavior of the tissue.
              | Indeed we have shown that the model is capable of simulating massive swelling and
              | the associated hydration change in the case of stroma immersed in an ionic bath.
              | The predictions also show that swelling interaction with the collagen network leads
              | to the observed anisotropy of swelling (primarily through the thickness direction)
              | and inhomogeneity (most swelling occurs in the posterior cornea) which strongly
              | supports the idea that the anterior cornea exhibits rigidity with respect to changes
              | in hydration (Bron, 2001; Muller et al., 2001).   Measurements for in vivo swelling
              | are not precise, but model predictions appear to agree qualitatively in all presented
              | cases, and quantitatively for the rather subtle problem of swelling under increasing
              | IOP. The model has provided predictions for swelling under Fuch’s dystrophy and
              | should also be adaptable to modeling other diseases of the cornea such as macular

text          | corneal dystrophy where the GAG concentration is found to be abnormally low.
              |    The model supports the necessity of lamellae inclination for stability of the corneal
              | anterior (refractive) surface (Bron, 2001; Muller et al., 2001). When lamella inclina-
              | tion is removed synthetically by adjusting the fiber distributions, the model predicts
              | an enormous increase in swelling in a stroma sample immersed in de-ionized water
              | (section 4.3.2). Theoretically, such swelling would become infinite, but in the current
              | model is limited by the small matrix shear stiffness. The structural role of lamella
              | inclination has been examined here for the first time and the results suggest that this
              | aspect of the collagen architecture is extremely important for understanding swelling
              | behavior and how the stromal fluid pressure is equilibrated.
              |    Finally, it is remarked that clinical swelling (edema), which results from hydration
              | changes in the pathological cornea, can occur under a wide variety of circumstances.
              | For example, during hypoxia due to contact lens wear, lactate ion production increases
              | and results in edema (Klyce, 1981; Leung et al., 2011). The underlying mechanism
              | has been identified as the accumulation of lactate acid due to increasing anaerobic
              | respiration (Klyce, 1981). Extension of the model to include these multiple species and
              | their interactions through metabolic reactions for aerobic and anaerobic respiration
              | is presented in chapter 7.

text          | proposed a model based on a six-fold symmetric elastic network. A six-fold symmet-
              | ric structural model was also proposed by Muller et al. (2004) in which GAG bridges
              | (presumably formed by duplexing) were proposed to link next-nearest-neighboring
              | fibrils. However, recent three-dimensional electron tomography imaging by Lewis
              | et al. (2010) and Knupp et al. (2009) shows that while GAG chains do appear to
              | form bridging structures between two or more fibrils, these structures do not exhibit
              | any approximation to a regular six-fold symmetric network or indeed any kind of reg-
              | ularity in spatial organization. Further, many GAG chains are not acting as bridges
              | and these linear structures reach into the interfibrillar fluid at various orientations.
              | All of this suggests that fibrillar bridges alone cannot mediate the fibril arrangement
              | (Lewis et al., 2010).
              |    Maurice (1957, 1962) speculated that repulsive forces must exist between adjacent
              | fibrils to keep them separated and that the origin of these forces was related to the
              | swelling force within the extracellular matrix. A conceptual model for the interfibril-
              | lar forces has recently been described by Lewis et al. (2010) in which an attractive
              | force system between a fibril pair resulting from thermal fluctuations of antiparallel
              | GAG duplexes is balanced by a repulsive force system which has an origin in osmotic
              | pressure. In this model, the fibril organization will adjust to reflect a state of equi-
              | libration between the two opposing force systems, which depends on factors such as
              | the number and type of GAG duplexes. The contractive entropic force from GAG
              | duplexes remains an essential element of this model.
              |    In the present work, a theoretical model for the forces which allow stable self-
              | organization of the collagen fibril arrangement is presented. An electrostatic-based
              | fibril restoring force is introduced which results from a hypothesized local change
              | in charge density induced by motion of a fibril relative to its neighbors. It is also
              | assumed that some GAG chains form antiparallel duplexes bridging between fibrils

title         | 5.2.1     Rationale and thermodynamic definition
text          | Consider an individual fibril displaced to a new position while all other fibrils maintain
              | their positions. Linear GAG disaccharide chains are associated with each fibril and
              | attach to that fibril at one end only via the PG core protein. It is hypothesized
              | that the attached GAG chains will displace with their supporting fibril. Because the
              | longer chains reach into the interfibrillar fluid, a local change in GAG fixed charge
              | density is created with an increase in advance of the displacement and a reduction
              | behind (figure 5.1). In our model, the interstitial GAG class introduced in section 2.2
              | are assumed to be involved in this process, whereas the shorter coating class GAGs
              | will not, until the coatings become close. Additionally, GAG chains that have formed
              | interfibrillar antiparallel, duplexed structures will experience changed entropic forces
              | resulting from changes in end-to-end distances. For the purpose of fully characterizing
              | the two restoring forces, the analysis in this section is based on an ideal hexagonal
              | unit cell with perfect duplexed GAG bridging based on nearest-neighbor connectivity.
              | In section 5.3, the important effects of random GAG chain topology is considered.
              |    The interfibrillar restoring force fl (r) is defined as the force which must be imposed
              | on a fibril to maintain its current position r. The external work required to move the
              | fibril from its equilibrium position r0 to displaced position r, while fixing the position
              | of other fibrils, is given by,             Z   r

text          | Figure 5.1: The electrostatic restoring force mechanism which acts on fibrils to maintain
              | their regular organization is illustrated for the case where all fibrils are held fixed in their
              | lattice positions and a single fibril is displaced relative to its equilibrium position. (a) Shows
              | a set of fibrils in a hexagonal lattice arrangement with their associated GAG chains and
              | a distribution of mobile ions. In this situation, which corresponds to normal physiological
              | conditions, the osmotic pressure is essentially uniform. (b) Depicts the osmotic pressure
              | in each subcell around the undisturbed fibril. The osmotic pressure in each subcell exerts
              | a force on the fibril (see equation (5.5)) but because the osmotic pressure is uniform, all
              | six forces balance and the net force is zero, as indicated by the red dot. (c) Shows a
              | fibril displaced from its equilibrium position. The GAG chains attached to the fibril move
              | with the fibril and the GAG fixed charge density and mobile ion concentration increase
              | in advance of the fibril displacement and reduce behind it. (d) Indicates the resulting
              | osmotic pressure in each of the subcells, which is higher where GAG fixed charge density
              | has increased and lower where it has reduced. The forces exerted by each of the subcells now
              | has changed magnitude with the result that a net force acts on the fibril with a direction
              | oriented toward its original position. This restoring force is shown as a red arrow. This
              | mechanism, which exploits the stromal collagen-GAG organization, operates regardless of
              | the direction of the perturbation and regardless of whether GAG chains are part of a duplex
              | or are independent. When any fibril undergoes a dynamic excursion from its equilibrium
              | position, the electrostatic restoring forces act to restore the fibril.

text          | at each vertex, see figure 5.1. The hydration is taken to be normal with J = 1, and
              | GAG fixed charges are allocated equally in each subcell. The resulting electrostatic
              | restoring force magnitude fosm is computed from equation (5.2) and depicted in figure
              | 5.3a-b for two fibril coating radius values rc of 18.25 nm and 21.56 nm. The force-
              | displacement relation exhibits two quasi-linear regimes with a transition where the
              | coatings begin to interact. This result quantifies the effect of the PG-coatings on the
              | fibrils as a mechanism preventing fibril aggregation. For example, with rc = 18.25
              | nm and λ = 0.65, the restoring force on the fibril at a displacement of 10 nm is less
              | than 1 mN/m; when the displacement is extended to 20 nm, the force increases to
              | approximately 3 mN/m.
              |    In order to characterize the isotropy of this force, the central fibril was displaced
              | around a circle while the vertex fibrils remained fixed. The results for the magnitude
              | of the restoring force are shown in figure 5.3c-d with two circles selected for each rc .
              | The smaller circle produces almost perfectly isotropic results as indicated by the flat
              | force-angle curves in figure 5.3c-d. On the extended circle, the coatings interact and
              | produce a degree of anisotropy.
              |    For the purpose of characterizing the entropic restoring force associated with the
              | antiparallel GAG duplexes, it is assumed in this ideal situation that all six nearest-
              | neighbor bridging sites are occupied producing a perfect network with hexagonal
              | symmetry. The results, shown in figure 5.4, indicate an essentially linear force-
              | displacement relationship. At a fibril displacement of 10 nm, the entropic elastic
              | restoring force is approximately 0.03 mN/M and is thus two orders lower than the
              | electrostatic restoring force. Note, however, that at equilibrium location r = r0 , we
              | have fosm = −fstr = 0, which reflects the ideal symmetry of this case.
              |    Table 5.2 summarizes the electrostatic restoring stiffness, defined as the fibril
              | restoring force per meter of fibril divided by the fibril displacement. The two quasi-
              | linear regimes were considered and the electrostatic restoring stiffness in each regime
              | was computed by least-squares regression. For example, with rc = 18.25 nm and
              | λ = 0.65, the electrostatic stiffness was 69 kPa for a fibril displacement less than 10
              | nm and 483 kPa for a fibril displacement greater than 16 nm (a seven-fold increase).
              | In contrast, the entropic restoring stiffness is only 3 kPa.

              | the computed g(r) closely matches measurements on electron micrographs of human
              | corneas (Freund et al., 1995) and indicates short-range order in the structure such
              | that correlations between any two fibrils becomes nearly random after r = 200 nm.
              | As σρ increases to 0.2ρ0stroma , a more irregular fibril arrangement with short-range
              | order up to 80 nm results. The average interfibrillar distance, which corresponds to
              | the location of the first peak in g(r), is maintained at d0c = 53 nm in all three cases.
              |    The influence of duplexed GAG bridging elasticity on the fibril arrangement order
              | has been studied by computing g(r) for four imperfect networks with fosm excluded.
              | The results are summarized in figure 5.5c. For a nearly perfect network (i.e. pb = 0.9),
              | the average interfibrillar distance is maintained as d0c but the peaks of the computed
              | g(r) do not decay as fast as the measurement with increasing r, indicating that a
              | long-range order lattice is predicted in this case (Farrell and Hart, 1969). For the
              | networks with more than 20% bridges missing (i.e. pb > 0.8), the location of the first
              | peak in g(r) is immediately reduced to 31 nm, which is close to the value of fibril
              | diameter and implies that fibril aggregation is occurring in this case. The results
              | indicate that the duplexed GAG structures alone cannot maintain the interfibrillar
              | distance when the network is imperfect.
              |    Figure 5.5d shows the computed g(r) when both fosm and fstr are present, with
              | σρ = 0.1ρ0stroma and pb varying from 0 to 0.9. The peak locations are maintained in all

              | model modifies the Donnan result with two additional inputs: the electrolyte volume
              | exclusion provided by the collagen and keratocyte stromal constituents, and the effect
              | of fibril PG-coating interaction.
              |    In the present work we have used a theoretical model to describe mechanisms by
              | which movement of a fibril out of its equilibrium position produces electrostatic and
              | entropic elastic restoring forces. In this model, the GAG chains generate the under-
              | lying tissue osmotic pressure and they are also responsible for a local perturbation in
              | that pressure when a fibril, along with its GAG cargo, is displaced from its original
              | position. All GAG chains can contribute to such a perturbation, regardless of whether
              | they are individual chains or are part of an antiparallel, duplexed association bridging
              | between adjacent fibrils. It has been shown that in the dynamic situation where a
              | fibril is out of its equilibrium position, the electrostatic and entropic elastic restoring
              | forces: (i) are both restoring forces, (ii) essentially operate independently and not
              | as an antagonistic mechanism in which they are required to oppose each other, and
              | (iii) the electrostatic forces alone can restore the lattice-like structure. In addition,
              | according to our calculations, the resulting electrostatic-based restoring forces subor-
              | dinate the entropic elastic forces of the antiparallel GAG duplexes and are relatively
              | insensitive to the random organization of the GAGs.
              |    As described in section 2.4, stromal swelling pressure has both osmotic (positive)
              | and GAG entropic elastic (negative) components; it depends strongly on hydration
              | and has a considerable physiological value of approximately 60 mmHg. However,
              | common experience informs us that healthy living corneas do not swell; the hydration
              | (and thus swelling) of the stroma is precisely controlled to be 78% water weight by
              | means of an active ion transport mechanism located in the bounding endothelial
              | layer (figure 2.2a) (Maurice, 1962). Hydration values exceeding optimal have been
              | shown to result in corneal opacity. The active mechanism that counters the swelling
              | pressure in the living cornea is implicit in the presented model because the stromal
              | volume (for any hydration level) is maintained by forces that precisely balance the
              | swelling pressure. Further, the fibril self-organization theory presented is valid for
              | the living system when the local perturbations in the osmotic pressure are based on

text          | the physiological hydration (as was done for the fibril dynamics model in sections 4.3
              | and 4.4).
              |    It has also been shown that, according to the model, if the fibrils do have a GAG-
              | dense coating, and our results do not preclude that, then when fibril pairs approach
              | to the point where the coatings are close or overlapping, an additional restoring
              | force mechanism is activated and the restoring stiffness (force per unit displacement)
              | increases six-fold over the value before the coatings engaged. In this way, the model
              | gives a quantitative assessment of the coating effectiveness with regard to preventing
              | fibril aggregation.
              |    In our modeling of randomness of the GAG organization, it is always assumed that
              | the duplexed GAG chains are perpendicular to the fibril axis (Muller et al., 2004).
              | In light of recent findings, this is not realistic because many are tilted with respect
              | to the fibril axis (Lewis et al., 2010). Such considerations could be included in the
              | theory, but presumably would tend to further reduce force estimates because only a
              | component of the force vector will act as a restoring force. In regard to the relatively
              | small bridging forces, it is interesting to note that in recent studies of other connective
              | tissues such as tendon, cartilage and ligament, interfibrillar PG-based filaments have
              | been found to be unlikely to have any mechanical role, e.g. Fessel and JG. (2009).
              |    The dynamic analysis was based on a fibril organization with a random GAG dis-
              | tribution. The randomness of the GAGs was reflected in both the spatial distribution
              | of charge and the topology of the bridges. A striking result is that the electrostatic
              | restoring force alone was able to reproduce the radial distribution function of the
              | fibrils for the human cornea, confirming the short range order of the arrangement;
              | no input from the GAG duplexes was needed. The converse did not hold. The dy-
              | namic case with bridging entropic forces alone actually predicted fibril aggregation
              | on a defective network because the entropic force is essentially contractive.
              |    The fibril dynamics study presented was performed at normal hydration. At
              | swollen state, the cornea can become opaque and manifest stromal “lakes” (Benedek,
              | 1971; Meek, 2008) which are regions in which the lattice-like structure is profoundly
              | disturbed with reduced numbers of collagen fibrils. Although results have not been
              | presented here, the proposed model is applicable to modeling these conditions. In the

              | the stroma. Biochemical studies have shown that the anterior corneal stroma has
              | a higher ratio of dermatan sulfate to keratan sulfate (Castoro et al., 1988). The
              | proposed theory could be adapted to model how the corneal hydration profile may
              | be affected by this distribution. Another potential application concerns the loss of

              | 2010; Quantock et al., 1990) or to genetically mutated corneas (Hayashida et al.,
              | 2006), which leads to a reduction in interfibrillar distance and a more chaotic fibril
              | organization due to the lack of PG regulation.

text          | Fluid pressure across biological membranes is crucial for maintaining the structural
              | integrity of biological systems. It interacts with osmotically active metabolites, mem-
              | brane potential and membrane tension to resist large volume changes of the system.
              | On cellular level, for example, fluid pressure plays important roles in regulating cell
              | volumes at normal state and driving its shape changes during biological processes
              | such as protrusion and blebbing (Charras et al., 2005; Stewart et al., 2011). On or-
              | gan level, for example, fluid pressure mediates fluid transport between the capillaries
              | and tissues, and facilitates the diffusion of nutrients between the two compartments
              | (Titze, 2013). Disturbance of transmembrane fluid pressure causes edema of cells or
              | tissues, and can lead to irreversible damage of the separating membrane as well. The

              | anisms such as cell volume regulation and interstitial fluid homeostasis, and is still
              | under investigation for various biological systems (Hoffmann et al., 2009; Jiang and
              | Sun, 2013).
              |    Membrane transport processes can be generally modeled by nonequilibrium ther-
              | modynamics, which is the formalism that describes the relationships among multiple
              | fluid flows and ionic fluxes that are simultaneously present in living systems. The the-
              | ory has the advantage that the underlying transport mechanisms, such as facilitated
              | diffusion by ion channels or carriers, or active transport by consuming energy from
              | metabolic reactions, are simplified in a convenient and pragmatic framework. The
              | classical Kedem-Katchalsky (KK) theory (Kedem and Katchalsky, 1958) is developed
              | along this line. It provides a general description that accounts for the interactions
              | between solvent and nonelectrolyte solutes. Its mathematical formulation is derived
              | based on the concept of dissipation function, which describes the total change of en-
              | tropy of a system, and takes the form of a linear combination of each flux and their
              | corresponding conjugate force in the system. In the past few decades, the KK equa-
              | tions have been extended to include various biophysical effects. Kedem and Katchal-
              | sky (1963) extended the original KK theory to binary electrolyte and applied it to
              | study the electroosmosis phenomena for membranes that are charged under current.
              | Hoshiko and Lindley (1967) incorporated active transport mechanisms into the KK
              | theory for single and binary salt system. This work develops a convenient approach to
              | describe the movement of substances against its electrochemical gradient in a mem-
              | brane system, although more phenomenological coefficients need to be introduced.
              | Kargol (2000) proposed a set of modified KK equations that takes into account the
              | effect of boundary layers on the passive transport across a membrane. The modified
              | theory is shown to give better prediction for glucose flux across a nephrophane mem-
              | brane. However, the theory is limited by the requirement of knowing concentration
              | both on the membrane surfaces and in the bulk (Kargol, 2000). Recently, Li (2004)
              | considered the transport of polyelectrolyte and integrated the electrostatic potential
              | difference in the KK equations. This study derives a new volume flux formulation
              | that is contributed by the hydrostatic pressure, osmotic pressure and an additional

text          | force that originates from the transmembrane electrostatic potential difference.
              |    In the current study, we extend the KK framework for an important case in which
              | fixed charges are distributed on one side of the membrane system (see figure 6.1).
              | This is a common situation existing in cell or tissue membranes where the charges
              | are provided by anionic proteins or large molecules that are unable to transport
              | through membranes (Friedman, 2008; Hoffmann et al., 2009). The presence of fixed
              | charges tends to attract counterions and cause imbalanced ionic distribution across
              | the membrane. This is the so called Donnan effect, which gives rise to osmotic pressure
              | across the membrane. In the steady state, appropriate fluid pressure is required to
              | balance the osmotic pressure difference. In this study, we first show that existing
              | KK theories (Kedem and Katchalsky, 1958; Li, 2004) derive zero fluid pressure across
              | membranes due to neglect of the fixed charges. We then follow linear non-equilibrium
              | thermodynamics and propose a set of enhanced KK equations considering: 1) the
              | presence of fixed charges on one side of a membrane, 2) transport of both ionic and
              | non-ionic species and 3) active ionic transport mechanism which propels a solute
              | from a lower to a higher concentration region. The proposed theory is validated by
              | recovering the Donnan equilibrium, in which a fluid pressure difference is required
              | to balance the osmotic pressure at the equilibrium state. Analysis shows that this
              | pressure is independent to membrane transport properties, and explains the swelling
              | tendency of a charged electrolyte gel regardless of the presence of bounding layers
              | (Hodson and Earlam, 1993).
              |    The second question this chapter addresses is: how do the fluids balance across a
              | leaky membrane when active mechanisms are present? The answer of this question
              | is through the analysis of the steady-state fluid pressure by the newly proposed KK
              | equations. A striking result is that the water potential need not to be equal on the
              | two sides of the separating membrane to maintain the steady state of the system. Our
              | analysis identifies an additional pressure mechanism that competes with the osmotic
              | pressure on balancing the fluid pressure. This new pressure force is derived from
              | the active ionic flux and the membrane transport properties, namely the reflection
              | coefficients and permeabilities. To illustrate the importance of this new pressure force,
              | we apply the enhanced KK equations to quantify the transendothelial fluid pressure in

              | molecules that carry fixed charges with concentration Cf and valence zf . The fixed
              | charges are assumed as been “trapped” in the electrolyte designated as “inside” (see
              | figure 6.1), for that biological membranes are usually impermeable to large molecules

text          | The above equations are still unable to recover the fluid pressure in the Donnan

text          | In this section, we apply the modified Kedem-Katchalsky equations (7.25, 7.26) to
              | study the equilibrium condition where the volume and solute fluxes (Jv = Ji = 0) are
              | zero. We show that due to the presence of fixed charges, a fluid pressure difference
              | (∆p) across the membrane is required, the magnitude of which equals the Donnan
              | osmotic pressure and can be interpretated as the swelling pressure. Interestingly, the

              |          transport
text          | The active transport across cell membranes enables solute movement against their
              | concentration gradient and is one of the major factors for keeping homeostasis within
              | the body. It is divided into two types according to the source of energy used, called
              | primary active transport and secondary active transport. In the former category,
              | the energy is directly provided by the breakdown of ATP. In the latter category, the
              | energy is derived indirectly from energy stored in the form of ionic concentration dif-
              | ferences between the two sides of a membrane. Direct modeling active mechanisms
              | requires identifications of the reaction kinetics, which is only known for a few pro-
              | cesses. Alternatively, active mechanisms can be incorporated into the nonequilibrium
              | thermodynamic description of fluid and ionic transport by introducing the affinity of
              | the driving metabolic reaction and its conjugate flux, the rate of reaction per unit
              | membrane area (Friedman, 2008; Hoshiko and Lindley, 1967), see also in appendix
              | E. In the simplest form, we treat the active ionic flux as an independent term that is
              | additive to the passive solute flux equation (7.26). The net solute flux equation can

              | brane (σ = 0.5) and the other representing a freely permeable membrane (σ = 0.0),
              | have been selected to illustrate the effect of Pref on ∆p. An essentially linear relation-
              | ship is observed between the active ionic flux and the three pressure estimations. The
              | osmotic pressure ∆Π is reduced when the active ionic flux is directed from inside to
              | outside as described by positive Ja . On the contrary, predicted Pref increases with Ja .
              | The fluid pressure ∆p, which results from the two competing terms, decreases with
              | Ja , indicating that the active ionic transport has a stronger effect on ∆Π than on Pref .
              | Noticeably, the influence of Pref on the fluid pressure difference is significant, espe-
              | cially when the membrane is more permeable (as described by small σ) to the active
              | species. For σ = 0.5, the ratio between Pref and ∆Π is about 0.6 at Ja /ωRT C0 = 0.1
              | (see figure 6.2a). For a membrane that is freely permeable (σ = 0.0), the correspond-
              | ing ratio increases to 1.2, resulting in a fluid pressure curve that is nearly unaffected
              | by Ja (see figure 6.2b). If the membrane is nearly semipermeable (σ → 1.0), Pref is
              | zero and has no effect on ∆p. The results in figure 6.2 show that the pressure force

              |            in vivo cornea
              | In this section, we present an example by applying equations (7.25, 6.42) to study
              | the endothelial ionic transport process of the in vivo cornea. The fluid and ion
              | exchanges across the endothelium controls the level of corneal hydration, which is a
              | crucial factor for the maintenance of the transparency of the tissue. Fixed charges
              | are associated with the structural proteoglycans in the stroma (the bulk layer of the
              | tissue), and generate osmotic pressure by Donnan effect (Hodson, 1971). The active
              | ionic transport processes located in the endothelium reduce the osmotic pressure by
              | pumping ions out from the tissue. Furthermore, metabolic reactions take place in
              | the cornea, rendering nonzero transendothelial fluxes for metabolic species (glucose,
              | bicarbonate and lactate ions) (Chhabra et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2011; Pinsky, 2014).

              | (Friedman, 2008), the key step is to take account the fixed charge concentration. This
              | work may be viewed as an extension from Li (2004), Hodson and Earlam (1993) and
              | Hoshiko and Lindley (1967) by including the effect of fixed charges, multi-component
              | solutes (both ionic and non-ionic species) and active transport mechanisms. The the-
              | ory resolves the difficulties of existing KK equations in predicting transmembrane fluid
              | pressure for charged electrolyte. It is particularly interesting to note that at equilib-
              | rium with zero fluxes, Donnan equilibrium is satisfied and the membrane properties
              | become irrelevant to the swelling pressure. This result explains the swelling ten-
              | dency of tissues like cornea (with fixed charge inside) with or without the presence
              | of a bounding membrane, a phenomena that has been observed experimentally and
              | explained qualitatively (Hodson and Earlam, 1993).
              |    The steady state analysis of the new KK equations shows that the fluid pressure
              | inside the separating membrane is composed by three additive components, namely
              | the hydrostatic pressure in the bath solution p0 , the osmotic pressure ∆Π and the

blank         | 
text          | This presents a challenge to the conventional view of the fluid balance across mem-
              | branes, which requires water potential to be equal on both sides (i.e. µw = µ0w )
              | (Hoffmann et al., 2009) and therefore the hydrostatic pressure ∆p being balanced by
              | the osmotic pressure ∆Π. Equation (6.50) suggests that water potential need not
              | to be equal across the separating membrane. Instead, the hydrostatic pressure is
              | balanced by the combined effect from ∆Π and Pref . Numerically, ∆Π and Pref are
              | having opposite signs, indicating their competing effect in contributing to ∆p: if ions
              | are pumped out to reduce the fluid pressure inside, the reflected pressure Pref will be
              | positive and play a counter effect, and vice versa. The quantitative analysis as shown
              | in section 6.5 and 6.6 show that Pref has a significant impact on p when the membrane
              | is leaky, indicated by a reflection coefficient less than unity. The significance of Pref in
              | biological system is also interesting to discuss. As active transport mechanisms take
              | place across biological membranes to maintain the internal pressure by removing ions
              | from inside to the outside environment, the pressure force Pref makes such process
              | less efficient - the membrane system is required to generate a stronger active flux to
              | overcome Pref , which costs more energy from the active transport mechanism.
              |    Specifically for the cornea, the pressure equation (6.50) suggests an new interpre-
              | tation for the stromal fluid pressure, which is an important quantity that interacts
              | with the stromal collagen and determines the fluid content of the tissue (Cheng et al.,
              | 2015). Historical views on the transendothelial fluid balance is predicated on the
              | “pump-leak” hypothesis (Elliott and Hodson, 1998). It assumes negative stromal
              | fluid pressure, which contributes a fluid leak from aqueous humor to the stroma, and
              | negative osmotic pressure, which results in a fluid leak in the other direction. This
              | balancing concept can be abstracted by ∆p = ∆Π, where the left hand side repre-
              | sents the source for the “leak” and the right hand side for the “pump”. According to
              | equation (6.50), the balancing condition can be relaxed: due to the generation of Pref ,
              | the stromal fluid pressure could be positive (see table 6.4) while the osmotic pressure

              | verifications.
              |    It is clear from equation (6.49) that Pref is highly sensitive to reflection coefficient
              | σi , which is a cross coefficient that provides a measure of the interaction between
              | the flows of solute and solvent. Although the KK theory is strictly phenomenological
              | (Schultz, 1980), the physical interpretation of σi is worth discussing. An alternative
              | way of interpretating the membrane transport is to view the conjugate forces as a
              | result of mechanical frictions among the difference phases (Kedem and Katchalsky,
              | 1961). Accordingly, σi has been found to be governed by the solute permeability
              | through the membrane and the friction between solvent and solute. It will be unity
              | only if the membrane is strictly impermeable to solute species i. On the contrary,
              | the more leaky the membrane is to solutes and the stronger interactions between the
              | solute and solvent phases, the smaller σi will be, which reflects in a larger Pref as
              | shown in the current analysis.
              |    Extensions on the current work include two aspects. Firstly, the new KK the-
              | ory can be incorporated into continuum models for cells or tissues to describe the
              | interactions between membrane transport and the bulk electrolyte inside. A multi-
              | phasic model for the living cornea that accounts for hydration, fixed charges and the
              | endothelial transport is under development. Secondly, it should be remarked that
              | the assumption of an independent active ionic flux is a proposed simplification for
              | convenience (Klyce and Russell, 1979). The consideration of active ionic flux, and its
              | coupling with the solvent and solutes can be elaborated by taking into account of the
              | underlying metabolic reactions (Schultz, 1980). This development requires identifica-
              | tion of the molecular mechanisms, and can potentially enhance the understanding of
              | active mechanism involvement in membrane transport.

text          | Metabolic pathways play crucial roles in supplying nutrient for cells in avascular con-
              | nective tissues such as cornea, articular cartilage and intervertebral disc (Chhabra
              | et al., 2009; Huang and Gu, 2008; Malandrino et al., 2014; Manicourt et al., 2006;
              | Zhu et al., 2012). This type of processes mainly involves oxygen and glucose con-
              | sumption, and lactate accumulation. These solutes, together with other biophysical
              | factors, control cell viabilities and influence the structural integrity of the connective
              | tissues. In the cornea, for example, accumulation of lactate ions due to hypoxia (low
              | oxygen tension) leads to oedema (Leung et al., 2011; Papas, 2014). In the interverte-
              | bral disc, low glucose concentration results in degenerative changes to the tissue by
              | lowering the cells’ ability to synthesize and maintain the extracellular matrix, which
              | is a significant structure helping sustain mechanical forces in the tissue (Huang and
              | Gu, 2008; Malandrino et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2012).
              |    Because it is difficult to measure the metabolic processes in vivo, numerical meth-
              | ods become useful to investigate the transport of nutrient within connective tissues

              | lenging, for that they are multiphasic materials that are formed from a fibrous network
              | of collagen/elastin with the interfibrillar matrix composed of glycosaminoglycans, in-
              | terstitial fluid, salts, metabolic species and cells (Cheng et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2012).
              | These elaborated constituents necessitate the use of multiphasic theory, which models
              | each phase (i.e. solid, fluid and solutes) by momentum balance and conservation laws.
              | In recent years, the mixture theory has been increasingly applied to study the effect
              | of cell viability on nutrient deprivation and on the degeneration of intervertebral disc
              | (Huang and Gu, 2008; Malandrino et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2012).
              |    Surprisingly however, a comprehensive mixture theory is still missing for the
              | cornea and the underlying metabolic processes. Earlier modeling works (Fatt and
              | Bieber, 1968; Fatt et al., 1974) only considered the transport of oxygen in the cornea,
              | and were unable to explain the hypoxia induced swelling during contact lens wear.
              | The effects of corneal lactate production, glucose consumption, and change in corneal
              | pH in response to hypoxia have been included in a coupled reaction-diffusion model
              | proposed by Chhabra et al. (2009). The theory describes the metabolic consumption
              | of glucose and oxygen to produce lactic acid, hydrogen ion and carbon dioxide through
              | Monod kinetics-based reactions for both aerobic respiration and anaerobic fermenta-

              | by the authors to analyze one-dimensional metabolic transport during contact lens
              | wear. In the important extension by Leung et al. (2011), a hydration model based on
              | the conservation laws for water (Klyce and Russell, 1979), salt and metabolic species
              | was combined with the reaction-diffusion model for the metabolic reactions (Chhabra
              | et al., 2009). This model is able to quantify stromal swelling induced by the distur-
              | bances of metabolic processes and provide sensible predictions for corneal thickening
              | under a contact lens with low oxygen transmissibility. While significantly advancing
              | the modeling methodology, this theory relies on empirical expressions for the swelling
              | pressure, ignores the effects of collagen network and the PG charges, and is restricted
              | to a one-dimensional situation. This limits the application of the theory to analyze

              | 2015).
              |    In this study, we propose a multiphasic model for the cornea based on the chemo-
              | electro-mechanical mixture theory (Huyghe and Janssen, 1997; Lai et al., 1991). A
              | complete set of coupled equations based on momentum balance and conservation laws
              | is employed to capture the full range of interactions among the solid elastic phase,
              | the fluid phase, the metabolic species, and the fixed charges in the cornea. Key ingre-
              | dients in this approach include: 1) a description of interactions between the effective
              | stress of solid network and interstitial fluid pressure, 2) the modeling of fluid trans-
              | port by extended Darcy’s law which describes the interactions between water and
              | solutes, 3) the coupling among fixed charge concentration, tissue deformation and
              | metabolites concentrations described by balance equations, 4) the adaptation of the
              | Monod kinetics-based model (Chhabra et al., 2009) in reaction-diffusion equations to
              | describe metabolic reactions, 5) the incorporation of metabolic species in the expres-
              | sion of osmotic pressure and 6) the integration of the enhanced Kedem-Katchalsky
              | equations (see chapter 6) to describe the fluid and ion transport through corneal en-
              | dothelium. Such an approach is applicable to describe volume (hydration) change of
              | the cornea in three-dimensional conditions, and is free from empirical treatment for
              | stromal fluid pressure. While currently focusing on the steady-state conditions, this
              | general framework is readily extended to study nonequilibrium phenomena such as
              | transient corneal swelling.
              |    The proposed model is implemented in a commercial finite element solver (COM-
              | SOL) and employed to predict swelling of stroma in an ionic bath. For the in vivo
              | cornea, we apply the model to predict corneal swelling under hypoxia induced by
              | contact lens with low oxygen transmissibility. The model is able to reproduce the
              | Holden-Mertz curves of corneal thickness and oxygen transmissibility factor (Holden
              | and Mertz, 1984). The results suggest competing mechanisms between bicarbonate
              | consumption and lactate productions in generating osmotic pressure in stroma, and
              | indicate that the diffusivities of the two metabolic species are comparable. Finally,

text          | In the corneal metabolism, glucose is primarily consumed through aerobic respiration
              | and anaerobic fermentation. Aerobic respiration involves the reaction of 1 mol of

              | along with 36 mol of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Its reaction formulation can be

              | where kO is the Henry constant. The negative sign in equation (7.8) describes that
              | oxygen is consumed by the aerobic respiration (7.1). The terms in the first and sec-
              | ond brackets of equation (7.8) represent the Monod dependence on oxygen tension
              | and glucose concentration. If the glucose concentration or oxygen tension increases,
              | reaction (7.1) moves toward the right direction and therefore increases the oxygen
              | consumption. The oxygen Monod dissociation equilibrium constant KOO in equation
              | (7.8) is set from the condition that the oxygen consumption rate attains 90% of the
              | saturation rate at a transition oxygen tension of 20 mmHg (Leung et al., 2011; Lin,
              | 1976), giving a value of KOO = 2.2 mmHg. The glucose Monod dissociation equilib-
              | rium constant KGO in equation (7.8) is taken to be 0.4 mM which corresponds to an
              | oxygen consumption rate of 93.75% of the saturation rate at a glucose concentration
              | of 6 mM (Frahm et al., 2003; Leung et al., 2011). Similarly, the first bracketed term
              | in equation (7.9) accounts for the dependence of lactate production rate on oxygen
              | tension. Lower oxygen tension promotes more lactate production via the anaero-
              | bic respiration. The “shift” constant KOL reflects how glycolysis shifts from aerobic
              | respiration to anaerobic fermentation as oxygen tension falls. The shift constant is
              | evaluated to KOL = 2.2 mmHg by assuming that an oxygen tension of pO = 20 mmHg,

text          | Constitutive laws for fluid and ionic fluxes In a porous medium such as the
              | corneal stroma, the fluid flow is determined by the gradient of the interstitial fluid
              | pressure and osmotic pressure, respectively (Cheng et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2005).
              | Water will be driven from the high fluid pressure to the low fluid pressure region,
              | whereas high osmotic pressure will drive water from the lower osmotic pressure region.
              | At equilibrium, the gradient of fluid pressure and osmotic pressure must cancel each
              | other to prevent any water flow. This interaction between the fluid pressure and
              | osmotic pressure is described by the extended Darcy’s law as (Cheng et al., 2015;
              | Wilson et al., 2005):

              | PG-dense coatings around the fibrils (Fratzl and Daxer, 1993). These coatings have

text          | The endothelium is located in the posterior surface of the cornea and is composed
              | by a cellular monolayer which is about 5µm thickness. It is leaky to both water and
              | solutes and facilitates the nutrient supply from aqueous humor to stroma. More im-
              | portantly, corneal endothelium regulates stromal hydration by actively transporting
              | ions from stroma to aqueous. The detailed molecular mechanisms, which are spec-
              | ulated to involve Na+ , K+ , ATPase and carbonic anhydrase activity, are not fully
              | understood (Bonanno, 2012). It is believed though, that bicarbonate serves as the
              | primary pumping species in such processes (Bonanno, 2012).
              |    As the underlying mechanisms of the endothelial pump remain elusive, the fluid
              | and ion transport across corneal endothelium can be described phenomenologically
              | by the Kedem-Katchalsky theory (Kedem and Katchalsky, 1958), which is based on
              | nonequilibrium thermodyanmics and provides a convenient framework to model the
              | coupled transport through biological membranes. In chapter 6, we have recognized

title         | Epithelium
blank         | 
text          | The corneal epithelium is a stratified squamous cellular membrane that is composed
              | of 4-6 cellular layers and approximately 50µm in thickness. In contrast to the en-
              | dothelium, epithelial cells exhibit tight junctions that prevent the movement of water
              | and solutes across the membrane. Consequently, the corneal epithelium serves as a
              | sealed boundary to most transport species. The exceptional cases are oxygen and
              | carbon dioxide, which are allowed to transport through the epithelium and facilitate
              | the metabolic reactions in the stroma. This is important for corneal health, as the
              | open air serves as the primary source to supply oxygen for the cells. If such transport
              | is compromised, for example in the long contact lens wear, it will alter the stromal
              | osmotic pressure and cause swelling.
              |        Only the transport of three species, namely oxygen, carbon dioxide and glucose
              | need to be considered in the epithelium region 2 , for that this layer is essentially im-
              | permeable to ionic species (Leung et al., 2011; Li and Tighe, 2006). For those species,
              | zero flux boundary conditions will be applied at the stromal-epithelium interface, re-
              | flecting the fully sealed boundary. It is noted that this treatment is slightly different
              | from that in Leung et al. (2011), which employed KK equations for epithelium but
              | with ion permeability several orders of magnitude lower than that of the endothelial
              | membrane. It is reported that the fluid and solute fluxes across the epithelium is in-
              | significant in the cornea (Leung et al., 2011). The detailed mathematical formulation
              | is given in the next section.
              |        The mechanical equilibrium condition at the stromal-epithelium boundary is set
              | to be the stress-free condition (Cheng et al., 2015), as no external forces are considered
              | to be applied.

title         | 7.4.3    Swelling induced by contact lens wear
text          | In this section, we apply the proposed model to study corneal swelling induced by
              | hypoxia during contact lens wear. Contact lens could impede the flow of oxygen from
              | the atmosphere to the cornea, leading to oxygen depletion and stronger anaerobic
              | reactions. More lactate ions will be produced in this process, and their accumulation
              | causes the cornea to swell. Oedema occurs when the oxygen transport is severely
              | affected by the low transmissibility of the lens (Holden and Mertz, 1984; Leung et al.,
              | 2011; Papas, 2014). It is therefore important to study the quantitative relationship
              | between the degrees of swelling and the lens oxygen transmissibility.
              |    In order to model the effect of contact lens, the cornea model presented in section
              | 7.2.4 was extended to include a contact lens layer with thickness L = 100µm in front
              | of the epithelium. As non-gaseous solutes cannot effectively transport through the
              | epithelial layer, only the diffusions of oxygen and carbon dioxide are considered in
              | the new layer. Simple diffusion equations with zero reactional terms are employed for
              | these two species, as no metabolic reactions take place in the lens.

text          | Predictions of the post-lens oxygen tension, which is the oxygen partial pressure at
              | the epithelium-lens interface, are plotted against experimental data (Benjamin, 1993;
              | Bonanno et al. 2002) in figure 7.6 for lens transmissibility Dk/L ∈ [1, 140] hBar-
              | rer/cm. Both open eye and closed eye conditions are modeled by employing different
              | boundary conditions for oxygen and carbon dioxide (see table 7.1) (Leung et al.,
              | 2011). The results show great agreement in the open eye case, in which the oxygen
              | tension quickly drops to zero below a critical value of Dk/L = 40 hBarrer/cm. When
              | Dk/L is larger, the oxygen tension is much less sensitive to the lens transmissibility.
              | For the case of closed eye, the prediction agrees closely with the measurement at small
              | Dk/L and overestimates the oxygen tension for larger Dk/L. It should be noted that
              | much less data points are available in the closed eye measurement (Bonanno et al.,

              | sets taken from table 7.3 where multiple DB estimations are provided (Fatt et al.,

              | DB = DL = 1.5 × 10−6 cm2 /s. The results suggest that the relative diffusivity be-
              | tween the two species is an important factor in determining the contact-lens-induced
              | swelling. When the two diffusion parameters are set nearly equal (the blue and black
              | curves in figure 7.8), the predicted swelling with decreasing Dk/L agrees well with
              | the data measured in the open eye (see figure 7.8a). The model predicts a critical
              | value of 20 hBarrer/cm for the lens transmissibility, below which the cornea will un-

text          | The cornea model is extended to include a centrally located hydrogel inlay placed
              | under a lamellar flap. The geometry of the inlay is simplified as an arch with a
              | thickness of 0.0314 mm (see figure 7.12a). The inlay is assumed as an isotropic
              | material with a Young’s modulus of 500 kPa and Poisson’s ratio 0.3. The stroma-inlay
              | interfaces are assumed to be tightly contacting boundaries for stress, water and solute
              | transport and continuity conditions described by equation (7.32) are assumed to hold.
              | As the inlay model contains numerous diffusion parameters that are not currently
              | available, we introduce the inlay relative diffusivity defined as Γ = Diinlay /Distroma ,
              | where i = Na+ , Cl− , B− , L− , G denote the five non-gaseous solutes. For oxygen and
              | carbon dioxide, the inlay is assumed to have the same permeabilities as that of the
              | stroma (Pinsky, 2014).

              | interpreted the thinning of the implant as been compressed by the stromal swelling
              | pressure. The current theory suggests an alternative interpretation: because the
              | embedded hydrogel does not carry fixed charges, the inlay serves as a local bath
              | solution; negative fluid pressure is developed in the inlay to compensate the osmotic
              | pressure gradient existed across the stromal-inlay interfaces. This interpretation is
              | in corroboration with the analysis by Bryant and McDonnell (1998); Cheng et al.
              | (2015), which view the negative imbibition pressure as that resulted from the local
              | Donnan equilibrium in front of the cannula inserted into the stroma. The observed
              | and predicted suction pressure in the inlay also suggests that this medical device
              | needs to possess a stiffness at certain level, without which the device might undergo
              | considerable deformations after implant.
              |    We have simplified the solid phase of the cornea, which is mainly composed by
              | the collagen fiber network, as a transversely isotropic linear elastic material. In real-
              | ity, the three-dimensional collagen organization does not possess such symmetry, for
              | lamellae appear to be anisotropic in both in-plane and transverse directions (Winkler
              | et al., 2011). As the cornea swells primarily through thickness, the depth-dependent
              | collagen network, which is reflected as significant fiber inclination and interweaving
              | in the anterior stroma, play important roles in maintaining the structural stability

              | might be justifiable to employ linear elasticity as a first approximation as the current
              | study focuses on relatively small amount of swelling induced by the disturbance of
              | metabolites transport.
              |    In our modeling of the inlay transport properties, we have simply employed a
              | relative diffusivity ratio as a scaling factor against the transport properties in the
              | stroma. A detailed experimental measurement of the inlay’s permeability for each
              | species may help improve the model accuracies. Furthermore, although preliminary
              | analysis indicates insignificant local and global volume changes even when the relative
              | diffusivity drops to 5%, complications associated with hydrogel inlays such as the
              | intracorneal deposits (occurred in 88.2% of the eyes in a five-year follow up study
              | (Bouzoukis et al., 2012)) are not considered. The formulation of these deposits may
              | become another layer of barrier that blocks the nutrient transport and accumulates
              | solutes in the posterior stroma. The modifications of the stromal transport properties
              | by these deposits warrant more experimental and clinical investigations.
              |    Future work includes incorporation of better collagen modeling in terms of nonlin-
              | ear elastic behavior and the anisotropy. The current model focuses on steady study
              | which renders the displacement and fluid pressure as time-independent. However, the
              | theory is readily to be extended to transient cases, which may be useful for interpret-
              | ing experimental results that are obtained in acute situations.

title         | 8.1      Conclusions
text          | This thesis presents theoretical and computational studies of three areas in corneal
              | biomechanics: 1) collagen-swelling interaction, 2) mechanisms of collagen fibril self-
              | organization and 3) corneal metabolism and edema. The problems tackled in these
              | fields are of great scientific and clinical importance, as interactions among collagen,
              | PGs and metabolic processes are believed to determine the shape and transparency
              | of the cornea. Furthermore, simulation can provide valuable insights into the cornea’s
              | biomechanical response to surgery and can help surgeons to improve design of refrac-
              | tive procedures. In this thesis, a first-principles model is developed for the in vivo
              | cornea based on biophysical descriptions of its structural components.
              |    As we have illustrated, describing the collagen-swelling interaction in the living
              | cornea is important but challenging. In the first study, we propose a thermodynamic
              | framework for the in vivo cornea by characterizing the free energies of the collagen
              | network and the saturating electrolyte. This approach has several novel attributes:
              | It accurately predicts the osmotic pressure deriving from PG-GAG distribution on
              | nanoscale, it incorporates the effect of active endothelial ionic transport into a fully
              | three-dimensional model of the living cornea and it can be easily implemented in a
              | structural finite element code without solving coupled equations out of necessity. For

text          | surface has been analyzed and the results suggest that this aspect of the collagen
              | architecture is extremely important for understanding swelling behavior and how the
              | stromal fluid pressure is equilibrated.
              |    In the second study, we extended the electrolyte model to illustrate the roles of
              | PG-GAGs in controlling the short-range order of the collagen fibril lattice. While
              | previous explanations for the controlling mechanisms are predicated on the roles of
              | interfibrillar GAG bridges, our results suggest that the osmotic-based force, which
              | results from local charge density changes induced by fibril motion, is essential to
              | maintain the interfibrillar distance. The estimation of such force is validated by
              | predicting the stromal swelling pressure, and by reproducing the lattice distribution
              | function measured from imaging data. On the other hand, our study indicates that
              | the entropic elastic force by the bridging GAGs is relatively small.
              |    In our last contribution, we developed a new metabolic model to study the re-
              | lationship between corneal metabolism and edema. This model, which is based on
              | multiphasic formulations, removes the limitations of existing models by coupling the
              | fixed charge concentration with metabolites concentrations and with the elastic defor-
              | mations through balance equations. This leads to a general three-dimensional frame-
              | work which is capable of describing the cornea’s swelling response to disturbances
              | of metabolic processes. For the first time, we analyze the biomechanical response of
              | the cornea under the introduction of a hydrogel intrastromal inlay. The agreement
              | between the model predictions and clinical observations demonstrates the proposed
              | theory as a useful tool to analyze the biomechanical behavior of the cornea after
              | surgical procedures.

text          | Modeling therapeutic cross-linking for treatment of corneal disease Col-
              | lagen cross-links are covalent linkages formed at specific binding sites or residues on
              | collagen molecules. This type of covalent bonds plays crucial roles in determining
              | the biomechanical properties of tissues by stabilizing collagen fibril structures via the
              | formations of intrafibrillar or interfibrillar cross-links (Gautieri et al., 2011). Under-
              | standing the molecular mechanisms of formation, degradation and manipulation of
              | collagen cross-links is essential for studying the pathogenesis and treatment of many
              | diseases in biological tissues and organs (Gautieri et al., 2011; Raiskup and Spoerl,
              | 2013; Saito and Marumo, 2010).
              |    Corneal cross-linking treatment is a recently developed technique that uses ul-
              | traviolet light (UVA) and riboflavin to stabilize or reduce cornea ectasia in diseased
              | situations such as keratoconus and post-LASIK ectasia. This procedure has been
              | found to prevent further corneal stroma thinning associated with keratoconus by sig-
              | nificantly increasing the cornea’s biomechanical rigidity (McCall et al., 2010). It is
              | believed that cross-linked bonds are produced via the photochemical reactions in-
              | duced by exposing riboflavin to UVA, causing an increase of both the fibril diameter
              | and elastic modulus of the tissue (Raiskup and Spoerl, 2013). In addition, recent
              | experimental studies showed a reduction of stromal swelling pressure after the treat-
              | ment (Sondergaard et al., 2013), implying alternations of stromal GAGs during the
              | surgical procedure (Klyce, 2013). While the clinical benefits of this procedure are
              | apparent, the molecular mechanisms that account for the type, density and place-
              | ment of the generated cross-links and for the potential changes of the GAGs are not
              | well understood. Illustrating these mechanisms is of great scientific and clinical in-
              | terests, and is an area of active research (McCall et al., 2010; Raiskup and Spoerl,
              | 2013). Currently, no comprehensive model has been proposed to explain the mech-
              | anistic details of the cross-linking treatment. However, nanomechanics of collagen
              | cross-links has been studied extensively in other biological structures including bone,
              | tendon and intervertebral disc (Gautieri et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2008). Together
              | with the recently developed model for the photochemical kinetics of the treatment
              | (Kamaev et al., 2012), existing studies have provided insightful clues for us to de-

              | direction for further explorations. Continuing work along this line can potentially

text          | Mechanistic models of endothelial pumping Understanding the molecular
              | mechanisms that underlie the endothelial ionic pumping is a long-standing research
              | question which has occupied physiologists and ophthalmologists for more than 50
              | years (Bonanno, 2012; Fischbarg and Maurice, 2004; Maurice, 1972). In this thesis,
              | phenomenological expressions were employed to provide a macroscopic description
              | of the ionic pumping effect. However, there are plenty of opportunities to improve
              | endothelial transport models by incorporating the underlying molecular mechanisms.
              | Up to now, biochemical analyses have identified multiple ion transporters and ion
              | channels that are responsible for fluid and solute transport across corneal endothe-
              | lium. Only few mechanistic models have been reported for the ionic pumping mech-
              | anism (Fischbarg and Diecke, 2005), and they are restricted to isolated corneal en-
              | dothelium in experiments. Although there is no consensus on a complete description
              | of the endothelial pumping mechanism, the published models already showed their
              | capabilities to interpret experimental data and to test scientific hypotheses. Further
              | development of the endothelial transport model for newly proposed hypotheses (Bo-
              | nanno et al., 2002) will advance the current understanding of endothelial pumping
              | and related corneal diseases. Incorporating such model into the continuum framework
              | for the whole cornea will provide a more complete description of the tissue.

              | and clinical measurements performed on the cornea complete in a short period of

              | IOP by applying a rapid air puff to deform the cornea. During the measurements,

              | 
text          | the tissue displays a complex rate-dependent behavior, in which the displacement
              | response is delayed with respect to the air puff loading. This has been attributed to
              | the viscoelastic properties of the tissue, and is believed to be a defining feature for
              | diagnosing corneal diseases (Luce, 2005). The theoretical studies regarding to this
              | phenomena have just started (Ariza-Gracia et al., 2015; Kling et al., 2014; Simonini
              | and Pandolfi, 2015). It will be interesting to extend the current model to include the
              | time-dependent feature according to the viscoelastic properties of the tissue. This will
              | expand the predictive capabilities of current models and enrich the understanding of
              | the tissue behavior under various time scales.

title         | Triphasic equations
blank         | 
text          | Modeling of polyelectrolyte gels requires a suitable description of interactions between
              | the fluid, solid and ionic phases. Mow et al. (1980) and Lai et al. (1991) proposed a
              | triphasic framework based on a continuum representation of interpenetrating phases
              | and their interactions. The solid, fluid and ions are treated as distinct phases with
              | individual velocity fields. This framework extends Biot’s poroelastic theory (Biot,
              | 1941) to model the transport of ionic species and their interactions with fixed charges,
              | and is able to predict the swelling of tissues. The theory has been generalized to
              | finite deformations and multiple electrolyte systems (Gu et al., 1998; Huyghe and
              | Janssen, 1997) and applied to corneal swelling under conditions of thermodynamic
              | equilibrium by Bryant and McDonnell (1998). Wilson et al. (2005) simplified the
              | triphasic theory to a biphasic swelling model based on Lanir’s hypothesis (Lanir,
              | 1987) in which the transport of ions is postulated to be much faster than that of
              | water. The Donnan osmotic pressure is employed to avoid solving the fields of ionic
              | concentrations, although the fluid pressure and displacement have to be solved in a
              | coupled system.
              |    Consider a binary electrolyte gel, consisting of a mixture of solid, fluid, and ionic
              | phases, immersed in a ionic bath at constant electrostatic potential ϕ0 , at hydrostatic
              | pressure p0 , and with ionic concentrations C0+ = C0− = C0 . We start by recalling the
