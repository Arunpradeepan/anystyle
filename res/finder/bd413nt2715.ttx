blank         | 
text          |        Four experiments test the idea that self-reliance is a functional form of agency
blank         | 
text          | for women in organizations. Drawing on theories of interpersonal perception and
blank         | 
text          | group based stereotypes, this paper suggests that women face backlash for displaying
blank         | 
text          | agency related to competition and hierarchy (e.g., dominance), but not for displaying
blank         | 
text          | agency unrelated to competition and hierarchy (e.g., self-reliance). This is because
blank         | 
text          | only displays of the former evoke negative assessments of women’s trustworthiness.
blank         | 
text          | Participants judged male and female targets to be similarly competent when they
blank         | 
text          | displayed high levels of either self-reliance or dominance (Studies 1-4). But, whereas
blank         | 
text          | they judged male targets to be similarly trustworthy regardless of the type of agency
blank         | 
text          | they displayed, they judged female targets to be more trustworthy when they displayed
blank         | 
text          | self-reliance than when they displayed dominance (Studies 1-4). Consequently,
blank         | 
text          | participants were more likely to hire (Study 2), to vote for (Study 3), and to invest in
blank         | 
text          | the company of (Study 4) a woman when she displayed self-reliance than they were
blank         | 
text          | when she displayed dominance. Participants made no such distinctions between men
blank         | 
text          | that displayed self-reliance and men that displayed dominance. Moreover, whereas
blank         | 
text          | there was evidence of backlash against women that displayed dominance in three of
blank         | 
text          | the four studies, there was no evidence of backlash against women that displayed self-
blank         | 
text          | reliance in any of the studies. These findings suggest that by framing agency as self-
blank         | 
text          | reliance female leaders may be able to demonstrate competence without a cost.

title         |                                      INTRODUCTION
blank         | 
text          |        Men obtain leadership positions faster and more frequently than women even
blank         | 
text          | though they are neither more desirous nor qualified for them (Catalyst, 2001, 2004;
blank         | 
text          | Hyde, 2005; Maume, 1999; Reskin & McBriar, 2000). This occurs in part because
blank         | 
text          | people negatively judge women, but not men, for displaying the agentic behaviors that
blank         | 
text          | are deemed necessary for positions of authority (Eagly & Karau, 2002; Heilman,
blank         | 
text          | Wallen, Fuchs, & Tamkins, 2004; Rudman, 1998). Because gender stereotypes
blank         | 
text          | prescribe that women should be communal and deferential – not competitive and
blank         | 
text          | dominant (Bem, 1974; Conway, Pizzamiglio, & Mount, 1996; Prentice & Carranza,
blank         | 
text          | 2002), people perceive women that display agentic traits to be more manipulative,
blank         | 
text          | unlikeable, and untrustworthy than women that do not display agentic traits (Heilman
blank         | 
text          | & Okimoto, 2007; Rudman, Moss-Racusin, Phelan, & Nauts, 2012). The problem is
blank         | 
text          | further compounded for women because, unlike men, when women refrain from being
blank         | 
text          | agentic, people assume that they are too dependent, too passive, and too focused on
blank         | 
text          | others to succeed in leadership roles (Eagly & Karau, 2002; Heilman & Haynes, 2005;
blank         | 
text          | Prentice & Carranza, 2002). Consequently, women are thought to be stuck in a double
blank         | 
text          | bind wherein no routes exist for them to be judged as well suited for positions of
blank         | 
text          | authority (Eagly & Karau, 2002; Rudman & Phelan, 2008).
blank         | 
text          |        This cannot be the full case as women do obtain leadership positions, and
blank         | 
text          | people see them as successful in these roles. If women are seemingly stuck in a double
blank         | 
text          | bind, then what accounts for their success? I propose that people’s perceptions of
blank         | 
text          | women’s suitability for leadership positions and their preferences for having women in
blank         | 
text          | leadership roles, rests on women being perceived as more agentic, not less so. These

text          | perceptions and preferences depend, however, on the type of agency that women
blank         | 
text          | display. I suggest that people judge women to be better suited for positions of
blank         | 
text          | authority when they display agentic traits unrelated to competition and hierarchy (e.g.,
blank         | 
text          | self-reliance, independence) than when they display agentic traits related to
blank         | 
text          | competition and hierarchy (e.g., dominance, competitiveness). When women display
blank         | 
text          | agentic traits unrelated to competition and hierarchy they may be able to demonstrate
blank         | 
text          | their competence without undermining perceptions of their trustworthiness. Thus, I
blank         | 
text          | suggest that self-reliance and independence may be functional agentic traits for
blank         | 
text          | women in organizations that help them to be seen as well suited for leadership
blank         | 
text          | positions.

title         | Gender Stereotypes and the “Lack of Fit” Problem for Women
blank         | 
text          |        Gender stereotypes and positional inequalities reinforce the belief that men are
blank         | 
text          | more competent, more esteemed, and better suited for leadership roles than women
blank         | 
text          | (Cejka & Eagly, 1999; Correll & Ridgeway, 2003; Eagly & Karau, 2002; Ridgeway,
blank         | 
text          | 2011; Ridgeway & Smith-Lovin, 1999). Descriptive gender stereotypes lead people to
blank         | 
text          | see men as dominant, assertive, and self-focused and to see women as warm,
blank         | 
text          | nurturing, and other-focused (Abele, 2003; Prentice & Carranza, 2002; Rudman et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2012). This poses a challenge for women in organizations because these feminine
blank         | 
text          | stereotypes are antithetical to people’s beliefs about the traits needed to succeed in
blank         | 
text          | these contexts (Eagly & Karau, 2002; Heilman, Block, Martell, & Simon, 1989;
blank         | 
text          | Ridgeway, 2011). Because people assume that successful leaders need to possess
blank         | 
text          | agentic traits they tend to see women as less suited than men for these position (Eagly
blank         | 
text          | & Karau, 2002; Heilman, 1983).

text          |        The fact that women are seen as less agentic than men means that they also
blank         | 
text          | receive less credit than men for the same achievements (Biernat & Kobrynowicz,
blank         | 
title         | 1997; Correll, 2004; Heilman & Haynes, 2005). People expect more valuable
blank         | 
text          | contributions to come from people who have a more valued status in a group (e.g.,
blank         | 
text          | men in mixed sex settings) than from people who have a less valued status in a group
blank         | 
text          | (e.g., women in mixed sex settings) (Correll & Ridgeway, 2003; Ridgway, 2011).
blank         | 
text          | Consequently, groups give women fewer opportunities to participate than they give
blank         | 
text          | men, and they pay less attention to the contributions of female group members when
blank         | 
text          | they do participate (Correll & Ridgeway, 2003; Heilman & Chen, 2003). When a
blank         | 
text          | woman is perceived as contributing valuable content to a group task, it defies people’s
blank         | 
text          | expectations and prompts them to be more scrutinizing of the merits of her
blank         | 
text          | contributions—wondering if she was responsible for the good outcome or if the
blank         | 
text          | outcome was due to the assistance she received from others (Biernat & Kobrynowicz,
blank         | 
text          | 1997; Correll, 2004; Foschi, 1989; Heilman & Haynes, 2005). This results in women
blank         | 
text          | needing to perform better than men in order to receive the same level of recognition
blank         | 
text          | for their achievements (Biernat & Kobrynowicz, 1997; Heilman, 1983; 1985).

title         | The Drawbacks of Agency for Women
blank         | 
text          |        If descriptive feminine stereotypes undermine women’s perceived suitability
blank         | 
text          | for leadership positions then one might expect that women would be perceived as
blank         | 
text          | better suited for these positions when they display more masculine, agentic traits.
blank         | 
text          | People do judge women that behave in more agentic ways to be more competent and
blank         | 
text          | to have higher status than women who behave in more communal ways (Powers &
blank         |

text          | Zuroff, 1988; Rudman, 1998). But, this boost to perceived competence often comes at
blank         | 
text          | a cost.
blank         | 
text          |           Women’s displays of masculine, agentic traits are discordant with people’s
blank         | 
text          | beliefs that women should be modest, communal, and egalitarian; they violate
blank         | 
text          | people’s prescriptive gender stereotypes, or their beliefs about how women “should”
blank         | 
text          | behave (Prentice & Carranza, 2002; Ridgeway, 2001; Rudman & Glick, 2001,
blank         | 
text          | Rudman et al., 2012). When people display masculine, agentic traits such as
blank         | 
text          | dominance their behavior indicates that they want to be better than or in control of
blank         | 
text          | people (Cheng, Tracy, & Henrich, 2010; Rudman et al., 2012; Wiggins, 1979).
blank         | 
text          | Whereas people expect this type of behavior from men (Ridgeway, 2001; Rudman et
blank         | 
text          | al., 2012), they are disapproving and even threatened by this type of behavior from
blank         | 
text          | women (Brescoll, 2012; Brescoll & Uhlmann, 2008; Okimoto & Brescoll, 2010;
blank         | 
text          | Rudman et al., 2012). They judge women that display these traits to be “manipulative”
blank         | 
text          | “selfish” “conniving” and “unconcerned with others” (Heilman & Okimoto, 2007;
blank         | 
text          | Heilman et al., 2004). They think women that display these traits are colder and less
blank         | 
text          | trustworthy than men that display these traits (Heilman & Okimoto, 2007; Heilman et
blank         | 
text          | al., 2004). Consequently, although they judge men and women that display these traits
blank         | 
text          | to be similarly competent, they deem women that display these traits to be less suited
blank         | 
text          | for leadership positions (Eagly & Karau, 2002; Heilman & Okimoto, 2007; Ridgeway,
blank         | 
text          | 2011; Rudman et al., 2012). Women appear then to be trapped in a double bind;
blank         | 
text          | people deem them less suited than men for leadership positions regardless of whether
blank         | 
text          | they do or do not act agentically.

text          |         I suggest that displaying agency, the very behavior thought to trap women in
blank         | 
text          | this double bind, may help to free them from it. Whether displaying agency makes
blank         | 
text          | women seem more or less suited for leadership positions likely depends on the type of
blank         | 
text          | agency they display. To understand this, it is important to first consider how group
blank         | 
text          | stereotypes form and why this process leads to negative assessments of agentic
blank         | 
text          | women.
blank         | 
text          |         Interpersonal perceptions arise from two fundamental dimensions. Although
blank         | 
text          | these   dimensions   have   carried   different   labels   (e.g.,   warmth/competence;
blank         | 
text          | trustworthiness/power; communality/agency; morality/competence), they boil down to
blank         | 
text          | two basic questions that are asked in an interpersonal encounter: Is this person
blank         | 
text          | competent, and can this person be trusted? (Fiske, Cuddy, & Glick, 2007; Fiske,
blank         | 
text          | Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002). That is, people want to know whether someone has
blank         | 
text          | positive or negative intentions toward them (e.g., whether he or she is trustworthy),
blank         | 
text          | and whether someone has the ability to carry out these intentions (e.g., whether he or
blank         | 
text          | she is competent) (Cuddy, Glick, & Beninger, 2011).
blank         | 
text          |         When it comes to stereotypes about groups (such as female leaders) people’s
blank         | 
text          | assessment of whether the members of the group are competent and trustworthy stem
blank         | 
text          | from perceptions of status and competition, respectively (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu,
blank         | 
text          | 2002). Male and female leaders both are judged to be high status. People see them as
blank         | 
text          | agentic, competent and responsible for their own achievements (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick,
blank         | 
text          | & Xu, 2002). Whereas these perceptions of status should result in feelings of
blank         | 
text          | admiration and respect for both male and female leaders, people tend to exhibit
blank         | 
text          | admiration only for male leaders (Cuddy et al., 2011; Fiske, Xu, Cuddy, & Glick,
blank         | 
              | 
              |

text          | 1999). They tend to feel envious prejudice against female leaders (Cuddy et al., 2011;
blank         | 
text          | Fiske, et al., 1999). This difference stems not from differences in the perceived status
blank         | 
text          | between male and female leaders, but from differences in perceived competition
blank         | 
text          | (Cuddy et al., 2011; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002; Fiske et al., 1999).
blank         | 
text          |        Perceptions that members of certain groups are untrustworthy (e.g., female
blank         | 
text          | leaders) often stem from people’s assessment that a group poses a competitive
blank         | 
text          | challenge to the ingroup (Cuddy et al., 2011; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002; Fiske
blank         | 
text          | et al., 1999). When groups are not seen as competitors of the ingroup, people assume
blank         | 
text          | these groups have positive intentions toward the ingroup and so regard them as
blank         | 
text          | trustworthy (Cuddy et al., 2011; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002; Fiske et al., 1999).
blank         | 
text          | On the other hand, when groups are seen as competitors of the ingroup, people assume
blank         | 
text          | they have negative intentions toward the ingroup, and regard them as untrustworthy
blank         | 
text          | (Cuddy et al., 2011; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002; Fiske et al., 1999). People
blank         | 
text          | judge ingroups, allies of ingroups, and reference groups (e.g., men) to be relatively
blank         | 
text          | warm and trustworthy because they see these groups as deserving of their positions
blank         | 
text          | (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002). Because male leaders are viewed as a reference
blank         | 
text          | group (e.g., Miller, Taylor, & Buck, 1991), they do not suffer the assumption that they
blank         | 
text          | are untrustworthy (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002). However, because people view
blank         | 
text          | female leaders as competitors of this male reference group, they judge female leaders
blank         | 
text          | as untrustworthy (Cuddy et al., 2011; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002). Thus, the
blank         | 
text          | perception that female leaders are less trustworthy than male leaders seems to stem
blank         | 
text          | from differences in the perceived competitiveness of these two groups. If this is true,
blank         | 
text          | then women may be able to overcome the “lack of fit problem” by displaying agentic

              | 
              |

text          | traits that do not activate these competitive concerns. That is, they may be able to be
blank         | 
text          | seen as both competent and trustworthy.
blank         | 
text          |        How can women display agency without igniting concerns about competition?
blank         | 
text          | Agency is a broad dimension of interpersonal judgment that relates to the expansion
blank         | 
text          | and individuation of the self and the attainment of one’s goals (Baken, 1966; Bem,
blank         | 
text          | 1974, Wiggins, 1971; 1999). Agentic traits can convey that someone is instrumental,
blank         | 
text          | independent, and able to initiate action, but they can also convey that someone is
blank         | 
text          | dominant, power seeking, and interested in controlling others (see Baken, 1966;
blank         | 
text          | Conway et al., 1996; Prentice & Carranza, 2002; Rudman et al., 2012, Wiggins, 1971).
blank         | 
text          | Thus, agency is similar to cross-cultural conceptualizations of individualism in that is
blank         | 
text          | seems to have both a horizontal dimension (e.g., aspects unrelated to competition and
blank         | 
text          | hierarchy) and a vertical dimension (e.g., aspects related to competition and hierarchy)
blank         | 
text          | (Singelis, Triandis, Bhawuk, & Gelfand, 1995; Triandis & Gelfand, 1998). If
blank         | 
text          | perceived competition drives people to see female leaders as untrustworthy then
blank         | 
text          | female leaders should not be seen as less trustworthy than male leaders only when
blank         | 
text          | they display agentic traits related to competition and hierarchy.
blank         | 
text          |        Cultural and developmental psychologists often categorize traits that express
blank         | 
text          | agency but not competition as a desire for self-reliance. As Triandis and Gelfand
blank         | 
text          | (1998) point out, people who are highly self-reliant are likely to say, “I want to do my
blank         | 
text          | own thing,” but they are not particularly interested in being better than others or in
blank         | 
text          | having higher status (p. 119). Self-reliance is considered a capacity and a desire to act
blank         | 
text          | independently and not necessarily an inability to be close to others (Steinberg &
blank         | 
text          | Silverberg, 1986; Triandis & Gelfand, 1998). For instance, studies of adolescents
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | unrelated (or sometimes negatively related) to emotional distance from, or poor
blank         | 
text          | relationships with, family and friends (Steinberg & Silverberg, 1986). Traits that
blank         | 
text          | express agency and competition are often categorized as “dominance” (see Cheng et
blank         | 
text          | al., 2010; Maner & Mead, 2010). Thus, the labels of dominance and self-reliance are
blank         | 
text          | used here to refer respectively to agentic traits related to competition and hierarchy
blank         | 
text          | and agentic traits unrelated to competition and hierarchy.
blank         | 
text          |         Because people believe that men are more self-reliant than women (Rudman
blank         | 
text          | et al., 2012), the expression of these traits may violate people’s expectations about the
blank         | 
text          | way that women do and should behave. Unlike the expression of dominance, the
blank         | 
text          | expression of self-reliance may mark a positive expectancy violation for women.
blank         | 
text          | Although both the expression of dominance and self-reliance likely boost women’s
blank         | 
text          | perceived status and competence (cf. Powers & Zuroff, 1988; Rudman, 1998), I
blank         | 
text          | suggest that only the expression of dominance ignites concerns about competition and
blank         | 
text          | hierarchy and, thus, only the expression of dominance undermines women’s perceived
blank         | 
text          | trustworthiness. The expression of self-reliance is less likely to elicit concerns about
blank         | 
text          | competition and hierarchy because its reveals little about a person’s desire to be better
blank         | 
text          | than or in control of others. Thus, I propose that when women express self-reliance
blank         | 
text          | they are less likely to face the negative assumption that they cannot be trusted. On the
blank         | 
text          | other hand, men’s perceived trustworthiness is less tied to expressions of their
blank         | 
text          | dominance, in part, because people believe that men are deserving of their dominant
blank         | 
text          | position (Sidanius & Pratto, 2001). So, when it comes to men, people may make less
blank         | 
text          | of a distinction between self-reliance and dominance.

blank         | 
text          |        display self-reliance than when they display dominance, whereas they perceive
blank         | 
text          |        men to be similarly trustworthy regardless of whether they display self-reliance
blank         | 
text          |        or dominance.
blank         | 
text          |        Hypothesis 1b. People judge women that display dominance to be less
blank         | 
text          |        trustworthy than men that display either dominance or self-reliance, whereas
blank         | 
text          |        they judge women that display self-reliance to be just as trustworthy as men
blank         | 
text          |        that display either dominance or self-reliance.
blank         | 
text          |        Because women that display high levels of agency often suffer from negative
blank         | 
text          | assumptions about their competitive desires (Cuddy et al., 2011; Rudman et al., 2012),
blank         | 
text          | people see them as being cold, harboring negative intentions toward others, and being
blank         | 
text          | untrustworthy (Heilman & Okimoto, 2007; Rudman, 1998). Consequently, people
blank         | 
text          | often are less inclined to hire, to vote for, and to work for female leaders than they are
blank         | 
text          | male leaders (Heilman et al., 2004; Okimoto & Brescoll, 2010; Rudman & Glick,
blank         | 
text          | 2001). If, as suggested in Hypothesis 1a and 1b, these negative assessments about
blank         | 
text          | women’s trustworthiness stem specifically from concerns about competition and
blank         | 
text          | hierarchy then the backlash against female leaders should be attenuated when women
blank         | 
text          | demonstrate agency in the form of self-reliance. Thus, I suggest that by displaying
blank         | 
text          | self-reliance instead of dominance, women may be able to escape the double bind that
blank         | 
text          | often traps female leaders and be deemed well suited for positions of authority.
blank         | 
text          | Because men do not face the same negative assumptions about competition, there is no
blank         | 
text          | reason to expect that displaying self-reliance would be any more or less functional
blank         | 
text          | than displaying dominance for men in leadership contexts.

blank         | 
text          |        Four studies test the prediction that self-reliance is a distinct and functional
blank         | 
text          | form of agency for women. In the first study, participants viewed a male or female
blank         | 
text          | target that displayed either low or high levels of dominance or self-reliance and then
blank         | 
text          | rated the target’s competence and trustworthiness. In the next three studies,
blank         | 
text          | participants viewed either a male or female target that displayed high levels of either
blank         | 
text          | dominance or self-reliance. Then they rated their impressions of the target’s
blank         | 
text          | trustworthiness as well as their willingness to hire the applicant for a managerial
blank         | 
text          | position (Study 2), their willingness to vote for the target for political office (Study 3),
blank         | 
text          | or their willingness to invest in the target’s company (Study 4).
blank         | 
text          |        I want to provide a brief overview of the participant pools from which I
blank         | 
text          | recruited participants before going into the details of each study. Participants were

blank         | 
text          | Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk (Studies 1, 3, and 4) or from a West coast business
blank         | 
text          | school’s private listserve of participants willing to complete online studies. Previous
blank         | 
text          | research has shown that studies conducted with online participant pools produce data
blank         | 
text          | that is of similar quality to data collected with undergraduate students in the laboratory
blank         | 
text          | (Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011; Horton, Rand, & Zeckhauser, 2011; Paolacci,
blank         | 
text          | Chandler, & Iperiotis, 2010). That said, researchers that have studied the quality of
blank         | 
text          | data collected from online participant pools recommend employing various checks and
blank         | 
text          | safeguards to ensure the quality of the data (Chandler, Mueller, & Paolaccci, 2013;
blank         | 
text          | Mason & Suri, 2012).
blank         | 
text          |        They say it is critical to implement some form of quality control to ensure that
blank         | 
text          | participants are paying attention and taking the study seriously. These types of
blank         | 
text          | controls include using attention check questions with easy and verifiably correct
blank         | 
text          | answers. I asked participants these types of questions in each study. Rather than
blank         | 
text          | including these types of questions in the studies themselves and then excluding
blank         | 
text          | participants that failed these questions, I used participants’ responses to these
blank         | 
text          | questions as a qualifier for participation in the study. Before each study, I asked
blank         | 
text          | participants to complete a multiple choice reading comprehension question. I took the
blank         | 
text          | questions from an eighth grade standardized reading comprehension exam.1

              | traveled one block when he heard his mother shout his name. He looked back and saw
              | her waving a brown bag lunch.” Participants were then asked, “What can you infer

text          | Participants were eligible for the study if they answered the question correctly. They
blank         | 
text          | were not eligible to participate if they answered the question incorrectly.
blank         | 
text          |        These researchers also recommend checking whether participants have
blank         | 
text          | participated previously in the same exact study or in a conceptually similar study
blank         | 
text          | (Chandler, Mueller, & Paolaccci, 2013; Mason & Suri, 2012). When I recruited
blank         | 
text          | participants for a study, I only allowed them to sign-up for the study if they had not
blank         | 
text          | already participated in a similar study of mine. So, if a participant completed Study 1
blank         | 
text          | they would be ineligible to participate in any of the other studies. Although this helps
blank         | 
text          | to get a naïve sample of participants (i.e., a sample of people that have not had prior
blank         | 
text          | experience with the manipulations used in the study) additional steps are needed to
blank         | 
text          | obtain a naïve sample of participants when using online subject pools.
blank         | 
text          |        Obtaining a naïve sample is a challenge with online participant pools because
blank         | 
text          | researchers from all across the world use these pools to run studies. It is difficult to
blank         | 
text          | restrict participants from the outset that have participated in similar studies because
blank         | 
text          | there is no master list of the types of studies these participants have completed (as is
blank         | 
text          | often the case with undergraduate participant pools within a university). Thus,
blank         | 
text          | participation in conceptually similar studies is one of the major limitations of online
blank         | 
text          | participant pools (Chandler, Mueller, & Paolaccci, 2013). Chandler and colleagues
blank         | 
text          | surveyed workers from Mechanical Turk about their participation in a sample of
blank         | 
text          | common experimental paradigms. They found that more than half of all of the
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
text          | about Jim from the passage?” They received five possible answers: (1) “Jim is in 4th
              | grade”; (2) “Jim takes the bus”; (3) “Jim is tall”; (4) “Jim is disorganized”; and (5)
              | “Don’t know”. The correct answer is (4) “Jim disorganized.”

blank         | 
text          | and some form of the ultimatum game, and one-third of the participants had completed
blank         | 
text          | some form of the trolley problem. When looking at the most productive workers (i.e.,
blank         | 
text          | the workers that use Mechanical Turk the most) the percentage of workers that had
blank         | 
text          | completed these experimental paradigms climbed to over 75%.         Given         these
blank         | 
text          | findings, Chandler, Mueller, and Paolacci (2013) recommend checking whether
blank         | 
text          | participants have completed similar studies in the past and excluding those who have
blank         | 
text          | in order to maintain a naïve participant sample. The concern is that because
blank         | 
text          | participants have been exposed to the experimental paradigm in the past (and
blank         | 
text          | presumably debriefed about it) their responses may be biased.
blank         | 
text          |        I checked for whether participants in the present studies had been exposed to
blank         | 
text          | conceptually similar experimental paradigms in the past. I did this by asking
blank         | 
text          | participants to report if they had completed a similar study in the past. I then asked
blank         | 
text          | them to describe in detail how the present study was similar to the study (or studies)
blank         | 
text          | they’ve completed previously. If they mentioned that the experimental paradigm was
blank         | 
text          | similar (e.g., “Similar to this study, in a previous study I was shown someone’s
blank         | 
text          | supposed responses to a questionnaire and then responded to questions about my
blank         | 
text          | perceptions of this person”) I excluded them from the sample. In no study does
blank         | 
text          | excluding these participants change the pattern of results. By excluding participants
blank         | 
text          | that have completed conceptually similar studies, however, the relative magnitude of
blank         | 
text          | some of the effects changes. The direction of the change is not consistent and does not
blank         | 
text          | follow a particular pattern (i.e., sometimes the effect gets stronger, sometimes it gets

text          | display self-reliance to be more trustworthy than women that display dominance. I

text          | also propose that people perceive men that display self-reliance and men that display

text          | type of agency the target displayed, I varied the questions to which the target person

text          | had supposedly responded. Participants were randomly assigned to see that the target

text          | Gelfand’s (1998) measure of individualism and collectivism. This measure captures

blank         | 
text          | saw that the target had been asked to indicate the extent to which she or he agreed or
blank         | 
text          | disagreed with each of the following items on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5
blank         | 
text          | = strongly agree): (1) “I’d rather depend on myself than others”; (2) “I rely on myself

text          | most of the time; I rarely rely on others”; (3) “I often “do my own thing.”
blank         | 
text          |        In the dominance condition, participants viewed the target’s responses to three
blank         | 
text          | questions taken from the vertical individualism subscale of the same Triandis and
blank         | 
text          | Gelfand measure. This captures the more hierarchical, competitive aspects of
blank         | 
text          | individualism, or the extent to which people value being better than other people
blank         | 
text          | (Singelis et al., 1995; Triandis & Gelfand, 2008). Participants saw that the target had
blank         | 
text          | been asked to indicate the extent to which she or he agreed or disagreed with each of
blank         | 
text          | the following items on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree): (1)
blank         | 
text          | “It is important to do my job better than others”; (2) “Winning is everything” (3)
blank         | 
text          | “Competition is the law of nature.”
blank         | 
text          |        I embedded the agency related personality items among four filler items so as
blank         | 
text          | to obscure the focus of the study. The three self-reliance items or the three dominance
blank         | 
text          | items came after four general and vague personality statements taken from research on
blank         | 
text          | “the Barnum effect” (see Forer, 1949; Snyder, Shenkel, & Lowery, 1977). These
blank         | 
text          | statements are broad and unspecific so that most people agree with them, although the
blank         | 
text          | interpretation of the agreement is essentially meaningless (see Dickenson & Kelly,
blank         | 
text          | 1985 for a review). Just as with the agency items, participants saw that the target had
blank         | 
text          | been asked to indicate the extent to which she or he agreed or disagreed with each of
blank         | 
text          | the items on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). The four items

blank         | 
text          | of your major goals in life”; (3) “At times you have serious doubts as to whether you

text          | have made the right decision or done the right thing”; (4) “You prefer a certain amount

text          | of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and
blank         | 
text          | limitations.” The target’s supposed responses to these items were held constant across
blank         | 
text          | conditions. All participants saw that the target responded with a 4 (agree) to the first
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | the degree of agency that the target individual displayed, I varied the extent to which
blank         | 
text          | the target agreed with the three agency-relevant questions. In the low agency
blank         | 
text          | condition, participants saw that the target responded with a 2 (disagree) to the first two
blank         | 
text          | items and with a 1 (strongly disagree) to the last item, for an average level of agency
blank         | 
text          | of 1.67. In contrast, participants in the high degree of agency condition saw that the
blank         | 
text          | target responded with a 5 (strongly agree) to the first two items and with a 4 (agree) to
blank         | 
text          | the third item, for an overall agency rating of 4.67. That is, participants were randomly
blank         | 
text          | assigned to see that a male or female target was either high or low in either dominance
blank         | 
text          | or self-reliance. See Appendix A for examples of the exact materials that were used to
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | various interpersonal traits provided an initial and enduring conceptualization of the
blank         | 
text          | types of traits related to agency and the types of traits related to communion. I elected
blank         | 
text          | to use the traits he identified related to trust and integrity because it is clear from his
blank         | 
text          | work how these traits relate theoretically and empirically to other interpersonal traits
blank         | 
text          | such as competence. I also choose to use traits from Wiggins’s interpersonal adjective
blank         | 
text          | measure because this measure offered subscales related to both perceived trust and
blank         | 
text          | perceived competence. Participants indicated the extent to which they perceived the
blank         | 
text          | target to be each of the following (1 = not at all, 5 = very): (1) uncunning, (2)
blank         | 
text          | uncalculating, (3) uncrafty, (4) unwily, (5) unsly, (6) guileless (7) undevious, and (8)

text          |        Perceived competence. To assess participants’ perceptions of the target’s
blank         | 
text          | competence, I used the 8-item success/ambitious subscale from Wiggins’ (1979)
blank         | 
text          | interpersonal adjectives scale. I elected to use this scale for the same reasons outlined
blank         | 
text          | above. Participants indicated the extent to which the target possessed each of the
blank         | 
text          | following traits on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all; 5 = very): (1) persevering, (2)

blank         | 
text          | stable, and (8) steady. I averaged participants’ responses to these items to create a

text          |        I ran a principle axis factor analysis with promax rotation on all of the outcome
blank         | 
text          | variables. As shown in Table 1, two factors clearly emerged. All of the items related to
blank         | 
text          | perceived competence loaded on a single factor, and all of the items related to
blank         | 
text          | perceived trustworthiness loaded on a single factor.

title         | Analytical Technique
blank         | 
text          |        For each analysis, I first conducted a 2 (participant gender: male, female) x 2
blank         | 
text          | (gender of the target: male, female) x 2 (type of agency the target displayed: self-
blank         | 
text          | reliance, dominance) x 2 (degree of agency the target displayed: low, high) ANOVA
blank         | 
text          | to see whether participants’ gender moderated any of the effects. I observed no
blank         | 
text          | moderating effect of gender so I collapsed across participant gender in each analysis.
blank         | 
text          | Thus, the reported results are from a 2 (gender of the target: male, female) x 2 (type of
blank         | 
text          | agency the target displayed: self-reliance, dominance) x 2 (degree of agency the target

blank         | 
text          | or dominance boosts perceptions of a target’s competence, I observed only one
blank         | 
text          | significant effect on perceptions of competence: the degree of agency the target
blank         | 
text          | displayed, F(1, 355) = 203.31, p < .001 (see Figure 1). Participants perceived the
blank         | 
text          | target to be more competent when he or she displayed high agency than when he or
blank         | 
text          | she displayed low agency. No other main or moderating effects emerged as
blank         | 
text          | significant, all p values greater than .14. That is, participants perceived men and

text          | dominance.
blank         | 
text          |        Perceived trustworthiness. A main effect of the type of agency the target
blank         | 
text          | displayed emerged, F(1, 355) = 5.17, p = .024. Participants perceived targets that
blank         | 
text          | displayed self-reliance to be more trustworthy than the targets that displayed
blank         | 
text          | dominance. There was also a significant main effect of the degree of agency that the
blank         | 
text          | target displayed, F(1, 355) = 55.53, p < .001. Participants perceived the target to be
blank         | 
text          | less trustworthy when he or she displayed high agency than when he or she displayed
blank         | 
text          | low agency. There was a significant interaction between the target’s gender and the
blank         | 
text          | type of agency that he or she displayed, F(1, 355) = 3.90, p = .049, as well as a
blank         | 
text          | significant interaction between the type of agency the target displayed and the degree
blank         | 
text          | of agency he or she displayed, F(1, 355) = 6.36, p = .012. These two-way interactions
blank         | 
text          | were qualified by a three-way interaction among the target’s gender, the type of
blank         | 
text          | agency he or she displayed, and the degree of agency that he or she displayed,
blank         | 
text          | although this three way interaction was marginally significant, F(1, 355) = 3.37, p =

text          | .068 (see Figure 1).
blank         | 
text          |        I assessed the relationship between the target’s gender and the type of agency
blank         | 
text          | that he or she displayed separately for low levels of agency and high levels of agency
blank         | 
text          | to test Hypothesis 1a. When the target displayed low levels of agency, there was only
blank         | 
text          | a main effect of the target’s gender, F(1, 355) = 4.39, p = .037. Participants perceived

text          | male targets that displayed low agency to be more trustworthy than female targets that

text          | displayed low agency. There was neither a main effect of the type of agency the target

blank         | 
text          |        A different picture emerged when the target displayed high levels of agency.
blank         | 
text          | There was no main effect of the target’s gender, F(1, 355) = .06, p = .81, but there was
blank         | 
text          | a main effect of the type of agency the target displayed, F(1, 355) = 11.10, p < .001.
blank         | 
text          | Participants perceived targets that displayed high levels of self-reliance to be more
blank         | 
text          | trustworthy than targets that displayed high levels of dominance. These effects were
blank         | 
text          | qualified by an interaction between the target’s gender and the type of agency that he
blank         | 
text          | or she displayed, (1, 355) = 6.99, p = .009. In line with Hypothesis 1a, participants
blank         | 
text          | judged male targets that displayed high levels of self-reliance and high levels of
blank         | 
text          | dominance to be similarly trustworthy, F(1, 355) = .64, p = .42. On the other hand,
blank         | 
text          | participants judged female targets that displayed high levels of self-reliance to be more
blank         | 
text          | trustworthy than female targets that displayed dominance, F(1, 355) = 17.56, p < .001.
blank         | 
text          | Thus, supporting Hypothesis 1a, participants perceived female targets that displayed
blank         | 
text          | high levels of self-reliance to be more trustworthy than female targets that displayed
blank         | 
text          | high levels of dominance, but they judged male targets to be similarly trustworthy
blank         | 
text          | regardless of whether they displayed high levels of self-reliance or high levels
blank         | 
text          | dominance.
blank         | 
text          |        I next ran planned comparisons to test Hypothesis 1b. In support of Hypothesis
blank         | 
text          | 1b and previous research (e.g., Heilman & Okimoto, 2007; Heilman et al., 2004;
blank         | 
text          | Rudman et al., 2012), participants judged female targets that displayed high levels of
blank         | 
text          | dominance to be less trustworthy than male targets that displayed high levels of
blank         | 
text          | agency (i.e., the male target that displayed high levels of self-reliance and the male
blank         | 
              | 
              |

blank         | 
text          | But, they judged women that displayed high levels self-reliance to be more
blank         | 
text          | trustworthy than men that displayed high levels of agency, t(71.50) = 2.78, p = .007.
blank         | 
text          | This suggests that women may incur interpersonal backlash when they display agentic
blank         | 
text          | traits related to competition and hierarchy (e.g. dominance), but not when they display
blank         | 
text          | agentic traits unrelated to competition and hierarchy (e.g. self-reliance).
blank         | 
text          |        I also wanted to see whether there were differences in perceived
blank         | 
text          | trustworthiness between low and high displays of self-reliance and dominance for
blank         | 
text          | male targets and female targets. Thus, I also looked at the relationship between the
blank         | 
text          | type of agency the target displayed and the degree of agency the target displayed
blank         | 
text          | separately for male and female targets. For male targets, there was only a main effect
blank         | 
text          | of the degree of agency they displayed, F(1, 355) = 42.72, p < .001. Participants
blank         | 
text          | perceived male targets that displayed high agency to be less trustworthy than male

text          | targets that displayed low agency.
blank         | 
text          |        For female targets a different pattern emerged. There was a main effect of the

text          | perceived female targets that displayed high agency to be less trustworthy than female
blank         | 
text          | targets that displayed low agency. There was also a main effect of the type of agency
blank         | 
text          | that female targets displayed, F(1, 355) = 8.72, p = .003. Participants perceived female

text          | targets that displayed self-reliance to be more trustworthy than female targets that

text          | displayed dominance. These effects were qualified by an interaction between the type

text          | targets that displayed high levels of self-reliance and female targets that displayed low

blank         | 
text          | female targets that displayed dominance incurred a cost for displaying agency in the

blank         | 
text          |        The results of Study 1 provide initial support for the idea that displaying
blank         | 
text          | agency in the form of self-reliance may be a functional way for women to demonstrate
blank         | 
text          | their competence without incurring a cost to judgments of their trustworthiness.
blank         | 
text          | Participants judged male and female targets to be similarly competent when they
blank         | 
text          | displayed high levels of self-reliance and dominance. Participants judged male targets
blank         | 
text          | to be similarly trustworthy when they displayed high levels of self-reliance or
blank         | 
text          | dominance, but they judged female targets to be more trustworthy when they
blank         | 
text          | displayed high levels of self-reliance than when they displayed high levels of
blank         | 
text          | dominance (supporting Hypothesis 1a). Moreover, similar to previous work (e.g.,
blank         | 
text          | Heilman & Okimoto, 2007; Heilman et al., 2004; Rudman et al., 2012), and in line
blank         | 
text          | with Hypothesis 1b, participants perceived women that displayed high levels of
blank         | 
text          | dominance to be less trustworthy than men that displayed high levels of either self-
blank         | 
text          | reliance or dominance. But, participants perceived women that displayed high levels
blank         | 
text          | of self-reliance to be more trustworthy than men that displayed either high levels of
blank         | 
text          | self-reliance or high levels of dominance.

text          |         Overall, Study 1 provides support for Hypothesis 1a and 1b. The question then
blank         | 
text          | becomes, given that women do not appear to face negative assessments of their
blank         | 
text          | trustworthiness when they display self-reliance, does displaying self-reliance help
blank         | 
text          | women to be seen as better suited for positions of authority at work? Study 2 tests this
blank         | 
text          | prediction by having participants evaluate either a male or female job applicant that
blank         | 
text          | displayed either self-reliance or dominance.

blank         | 
text          |        Study 2 further assesses the functional aspects of self-reliance for women in
blank         | 
text          | organizations. In particular, Study 2 tests the prediction that people will be less
blank         | 
text          | inclined to hire female applicants than male applicants for a managerial position only
blank         | 
text          | when female applicants display dominance (i.e., agentic traits related to competition
blank         | 
text          | and hierarchy). People will be just as inclined to hire a female applicant as a male
blank         | 
text          | applicant when the female applicant displays self-reliance. To test these predictions,
blank         | 
text          | participants were randomly assigned to review application materials for either a male
blank         | 
text          | or female job applicant that displayed either high self-reliance or high dominance. 2

title         | Procedure

text          |        Participants reviewed application materials from a job applicant who was
blank         | 
text          | applying for a position as an associate at a management consulting company. After
blank         | 
text          | reading a brief description of the firm, participants received a job applicant’s cover
blank         | 
text          | letter, resume, and letter of recommendation. When participants finished reviewing the
blank         | 
text          | materials, they answered several questions about the applicant. Participants concluded
blank         | 
text          | the study by completing a short demographics questionnaire. See Appendix B for an
blank         | 
text          | example of these materials.

text          | application materials from either a male or female job applicant. I varied the
blank         | 
text          | applicant’s gender by altering the applicant’s name. Participants in the female
blank         | 
text          | applicant condition received Elizabeth Clark’s application materials. Participants in

text          | the male applicant condition received William Clark’s application materials.
blank         | 
text          |        Type of agency the applicant displayed. I manipulated the type of agency the
blank         | 
text          | applicant displayed by varying the way the applicant described him/herself in the
blank         | 
text          | cover letter and the way the applicant was described in the letter of recommendation.
blank         | 
text          | The cover letter and letter of recommendation were identical across conditions except
blank         | 
text          | for a paragraph in each in which the applicant’s agency was described.
blank         | 
text          |        In the cover letter, the applicant described him or herself as either dominant or
blank         | 
text          | self-reliant. The applicant that displayed dominance stated, “My education and work

blank         | 
text          | and I strive to take charge of group tasks.” On the other hand, the applicant that
blank         | 
text          | displayed self-reliance stated, “My education and work experience have taught be to
blank         | 
text          | self-reliant and independent. I find ways to complete tasks and assignments on my
blank         | 
text          | own. I strive to depend on myself, rather than on others, to accomplish what I need to

text          | get done.”
blank         | 
text          |        In the letter of recommendation, the letter writer described the applicant as
blank         | 
text          | either dominant or self-reliant. To describe the applicant as dominant, the letter writer
blank         | 
text          | stated, “Ms. Clark [Mr. Clark] is competent and hardworking. She [He] successfully

blank         | 
text          | you would interview her [him]?” (1 = very unlikely; 5 = very likely); (2) “What is the
blank         | 
text          | likelihood that you would hire her [him]?” (1 = very unlikely; 5 = very likely); (3)
blank         | 
text          | “How much better or worse do you think this candidate is compared to other possible
blank         | 
text          | candidates?” (1 = much worse than other candidates; 5 = much better than other
blank         | 
text          | candidates); (4) “To what extent do you agree of disagree that she [he] would make a
blank         | 
text          | good leader?” (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree); (5) “If you were to hire her
blank         | 
text          | [him], what would you recommend her [his] starting salary be from $90,000/year to
blank         | 
text          | $120,000/year?” Participants selected from a dropdown list of seven starting salaries
blank         | 
text          | that started at $90,000 and increased in $5,000 increments to $120,000. Because the

text          | first four items were measured on five point scales and the fifth item was measured on

text          | ANOVA for each dependent variable to see whether participants’ gender moderated

text          | .44. On the other hand, participants were more inclined to hire the female applicant

blank         | 
text          | 6.17, p = .014, supporting Hypothesis 2a..
blank         | 
text          |        To assess Hypothesis 2b, I again ran planned contrasts to compare (1)
blank         | 
text          | participants’ desire to hire the female applicant that displayed dominance to their
blank         | 
text          | desire to hire the two male applicants (combined), and (2) participants’ desire to hire
blank         | 
text          | the female applicant that displayed self-reliance to their desire to hire the two male
blank         | 
text          | applicants combined (combined). Similar to past research showing backlash against
blank         | 
text          | highly agentic women (e.g., Heilman & Okimoto, 2007; Heilman et al., 2004; Rudman
blank         | 
text          | et al., 2012), participants were less inclined to hire a dominant female applicant than a
blank         | 
text          | male applicant, t(119) = -2.13, p = .036. But, participants were just as inclined to hire

blank         | 
text          | Thus, in line with Hypothesis 2b, the female applicants encountered backlash only

text          | Participants perceived the male applicant to be similarly trustworthy regardless of

blank         | 
text          | .014. Thus, replicating Study 1, whereas participants perceived women that displayed

text          | self-reliance to be more trustworthy than women that displayed dominance, they
blank         |

text          | perceived trustworthiness and (2) the self-reliant female applicant’s perceived

text          |        Moderated mediation analysis. I ran a moderated mediation model to test
blank         | 
text          | whether perceptions of the job applicant’s trustworthiness mediated the interactive
blank         | 
text          | effect of the applicant’s gender and the type of agency that he or she displayed on
blank         | 
text          | participants’ desire to hire him or her. That is, I tested whether, for the female job
blank         | 
text          | applicant, judgments of her trustworthiness mediated the effect of the type of agency
blank         | 
text          | she displayed on participant’s desire to hire her. Given that participants were similarly
blank         | 
text          | inclined to hire the male applicant and judged him to be similarly trustworthy
blank         | 
text          | regardless of whether he displayed self-reliance or dominance, I did not expect any
blank         | 
text          | mediated effect for the male applicant.
blank         | 
text          |        I first assessed whether participants’ perceptions of the applicant’s
blank         | 
text          | trustworthiness predicted participants’ desire to hire him or her and whether either the
blank         | 
text          | applicant’s gender or the type of agency the applicant displayed moderated this
blank         | 
text          | relationship. An ANOVA with the applicant’s gender, the type of agency the applicant
blank         | 
text          | displayed, and the applicant’s perceived trustworthiness as predictor variables,
blank         | 
text          | revealed only a significant main effect of perceived trustworthiness, F(1, 115) = 66.30,
blank         | 
text          | p < .001. No other main or moderating effects emerged, all p values greater than .16.
blank         | 
text          | That is, the positive relationship between participants’ perceptions of the applicant’s
blank         | 
text          | trustworthiness and their desire to hire the applicant did not vary as a function of the

blank         | 
text          | relationship between the proposed mediator and the dependent variable was not
blank         | 
text          | moderated, I ran a moderated mediation model that corresponds to Model 2 specified

text          | by Preacher, Rucker, and Hayes (2007).
blank         | 
text          |        For female job applicants, the indirect effect of the type of agency they
blank         | 
text          | displayed on participants’ desire to hire them through perceptions of their
blank         | 
text          | trustworthiness was .14 and the 95% CI (bias corrected) ranged from .03 to .28. Thus,
blank         | 
text          | in support of Hypothesis 3, participants were more inclined to hire the self-reliant
blank         | 
text          | female applicant than the dominant female applicant because they perceived the self-
blank         | 
text          | reliant female applicant to be more trustworthy.
blank         | 
text          |        To further test Hypothesis 3, I also ran a mediation model to assess whether
blank         | 
text          | participants’ perceptions of the applicant’s trustworthiness could account for the fact
blank         | 
text          | that participants were less inclined to hire the female applicant that displayed
blank         | 
text          | dominance than the male applicants. To do this, I created a dummy variable for both
blank         | 
text          | the female applicant that displayed dominance and a dummy variable for the female
blank         | 
text          | applicant that displayed self-reliance. I specified the dummy variable for the female
blank         | 
text          | applicant that displayed dominance as the predictor variable and the dummy variable
blank         | 
text          | for the female applicant that displayed self-reliance as a covariate in a process model
blank         | 
text          | developed by Preacher and Hayes (2004) for testing indirect effects. This left the
blank         | 
text          | reference group as male applicants. The indirect effect was -.27 and the 95%
blank         | 
text          | confidence interval ranged from -.52 to -.04. Thus, further supporting Hypothesis 3,
blank         |

text          |                                       Discussion
blank         | 
text          |        Study 2 builds on Study 1 by showing that the type of agency women display
blank         | 
text          | not only influences their perceived trustworthiness, but also how willing people are to
blank         | 
text          | hire them. Participants were more inclined to hire a woman applying to a management
blank         | 
text          | consulting position when she displayed self-reliance than when she displayed
blank         | 
text          | dominance because they perceived her to be more trustworthy when she displayed
blank         | 
text          | self-reliance. Participants were similarly inclined, however, to hire a male applicant
blank         | 
text          | and saw him as similarly trustworthy regardless of the type of agency he displayed.
blank         | 
text          | Replicating past findings about backlash against agentic women, participants were less
blank         | 
text          | inclined to hire a female applicant that displayed dominance than they were to hire
blank         | 
text          | male applicants, even though the applicants were perceived to be similarly competent.
blank         | 
text          | But, participants were just as likely to hire a female applicant that displayed self-
blank         | 
text          | reliance as they were to hire male applicants. This provides further support for the idea
blank         | 
text          | that framing agency as self-reliance may be one way that women can overcome some
blank         | 
text          | of the negative interpersonal judgments that arise when they seek leadership positions.
blank         | 
text          |        I suggest that displaying self-reliance may be one way for women to be seen as
blank         | 
text          | better suited for positions of authority. One shortcoming of Study 2 was that it
blank         | 
text          | assessed participants’ willingness to hire someone for a management consulting
blank         | 
text          | position, which may or may not have great authority. The question then becomes, do
blank         | 
text          | people respond better to female leaders when they display self-reliance than when they
blank         | 
text          | display dominance? That is, do women leaders face backlash for being agentic only

text          | their likelihood of voting for the state representative and their perceptions of his or her

text          | addition to contact information, committee assignments, and a brief biography, the

text          | Participants also reported the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with each of the

text          | following statements that were adapted from a measure of dominance used by Maner

text          | Participants responded to these items on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 7 =

blank         |

text          |        To help obscure the study’s interest in the relationship between the content of

text          | the state representative’s webpage and the various dependent variables, participants
blank         | 
text          | responded to two questions about their impressions of the state representative’s
blank         | 
text          | website: (1) “How much do you like or dislike the layout of the webpage?” (1 =
blank         | 
text          | strongly dislike; 7 = strongly like); (2) “How easy or difficult was it to read the
blank         | 
text          | webpage?” (1 = very difficult; 7 = very easy). The items loaded on the same factor (see
blank         | 
text          | Table 5) and demonstrated moderate reliability (α = .63). I averaged the items to create
blank         | 
text          | an overall measure of participants’ regard for the state representative’s webpage.
blank         | 
text          | Participants’ regard for the webpage was highly correlated with both their desire to
blank         | 
text          | vote for the state representative, r = .40, p < .001, and with their perceptions of the

text          |        Given the strong correlations between this variable and the outcome variables,
blank         | 
text          | I sought to include participants’ regard for the state representative’s webpage as a
blank         | 
text          | covariate in the model in order to increase the statistical power of the tests of the
blank         | 
text          | independent variables. The inclusion of covariates in experimental studies has been
blank         | 
text          | shown to significantly reduce error variance thereby increasing the power of between-
blank         | 
text          | group comparisons (see Fleiss, 1986; Mulligan & Wiesen, 2003; Porter &
blank         | 
text          | Raudenbush, 1987). Indeed, including regard for the state representative’s webpage as
blank         | 
text          | a covariate increased the statistical power of the tests of the independent effects in the
blank         | 
text          | following analyses. Using covariates to increase the statistical power of interaction
blank         | 
text          | effects, however, is deemed appropriate only when the covariate is unrelated to the
blank         | 
text          | independent variables (Yzerbyt, Muller & Judd, 2004). This is because the estimates
blank         | 
text          | of the effects of the independent variables are only unchanged when the covariate is
blank         | 
text          | unrelated to the independent variables (Yzerbyt, Muller & Judd, 2004). Thus, I
blank         | 
text          | checked to see whether the state representative’s gender or the type of agency the state
blank         | 
text          | representative displayed affected participants’ regard for the state representative’s
blank         | 
text          | webpage. An ANOVA showed that participants’ regard for the webpage did not vary
blank         | 
text          | as a function of either the state representative’s gender or the type of agency that he or
blank         | 
text          | she displayed. Thus, I elected to include regard for the state representative’s webpage
blank         | 
text          | as a covariate in each analysis in order to increase the statistical power of the test of
blank         | 
text          | the effects of the independent variables. I also report what the results look like if this
blank         | 
text          | covariate is not included for participants’ willingness to vote for the state
blank         | 
text          | representative and for their perceptions of the state representatives’ trustworthiness.

blank         | 
text          | agency that he displayed. Moreover, perceptions of the politician’s trustworthiness
blank         | 
text          | mediated this difference (see Footnote 8). That said, although the pattern of means was
blank         | 
text          | similar to those in Study 1 and Study 2, the interaction between the politician’s gender
blank         | 
text          | and the type of agency he or she displayed on perceptions of trustworthiness was not
blank         | 
text          | significant. The findings from this study also diverge a bit from past work on
blank         | 
text          | interpersonal backlash against agentic women. Participants were just as inclined to
blank         | 
text          | vote for a female politician that displayed dominance, and they were more inclined to
blank         | 
text          | vote for a female politician that displayed self-reliance, than they were for male
blank         | 
text          | politicians. Although these findings support the idea that self-reliance may be a more
blank         | 
text          | functional form of agency for women than dominance, they suggest that, at least in
blank         | 
text          | this context, neither form of agency evokes backlash. Given the inconsistencies
blank         | 
text          | between Study 3 and Studies 1 and 2, Study 4 provided a similar test of people’s
blank         | 
text          | perceptions of male and female leaders to see which pattern replicated.
blank         | 
text          |        There were two other aims of Study 4. The first was to assess whether
blank         | 
text          | displaying self-reliance is actually functional for women in organizations, or if it is
blank         | 
text          | just not as bad as displaying dominance. Because the previous studies compared
blank         | 
text          | participants’ perceptions of male and female targets that displayed either self-reliance
blank         | 
text          | or dominance, it is unclear whether it is more functional for women to display self-
blank         | 
text          | reliance or to display no particular agentic trait. Study 4 addresses this issue by
blank         | 
text          | including a condition in which participants read about a male or female leader that
blank         | 
text          | displays no specific type of agency. The other purpose of Study 4 was to better assess
blank         | 
text          | the external validity of the present predictions. To this end, rather than reading about

blank         | 
text          | varied the way in which these targets were described in the online article. In particular,
blank         | 
text          | the article described them as self-reliant, dominant, or it provided no specific
blank         | 
text          | information about their agency. This last condition served as a neutral condition from
blank         | 
text          | which to assess the relative benefits or drawbacks of displaying self-reliance or
blank         | 
text          | dominance.
blank         | 
text          | To describe Sheryl Sandberg or Jeff Weiner as self-reliant, the article reported the

blank         | 
text          | the company. Next participants were asked, “How much do you think a share of

text          | money from $0.00 to $100.00. Finally, participants were asked, “Overall, how

text          | successful or unsuccessful do you think Facebook [LinkedIn] will be over the next

text          | five years?” They responded to this question on a 7-point scale (1 = very unsuccessful,

blank         | 
text          | executive displayed on participants’ perceptions of the executive’s self-reliance, F(2,
blank         |

text          | when she or he displayed self-reliance than when she or he did not display self-
blank         | 
text          | reliance. Thus, the manipulation of self-reliance was effective. That said, there was

text          | Sheryl Sandberg to be more self-reliant than Jeff Weiner. These effects were qualified
blank         | 
text          | by an interaction between the executive and the type of agency that he or she

text          | displayed, F(2, 272) = 3.54, p = .030. I probed this interaction by looking at the effect

text          | effects with categorical variables. This involved creating k (number of categories) - 1
blank         | 
text          | dummy variables. For each assessment, I compared two categories and included the
blank         | 
text          | third category as a covariate. For instance, to see whether perceptions of Sheryl

text          | Sandberg’s trustworthiness mediated participants’ greater willingness to invest in
blank         | 
text          | Facebook when she displayed self-reliance than when she displayed dominance, I

text          |        In support of Hypothesis 3, participants were more inclined to invest in

text          | either dominance or no specific type of agency because they trusted her more when

text          | she displayed self-reliance. The indirect effect of displaying self-reliance or
blank         | 
text          | dominance on participants’ willingness to invest in Facebook through perceptions of
blank         | 
text          | Sheryl Sandberg’s trustworthiness was .17 and the 95% bias corrected confidence

text          |         Supplementary analysis. Although Facebook and LinkedIn are two popular
blank         | 
text          | social media websites, participants may have been more familiar with one of the

text          | effects only emerge when observers are or are not familiar with the given target. To
blank         | 
text          | address this concern, I assessed whether participants’ familiarity with the company or
blank         | 
text          | their familiarity with the executive moderated any of the observed effects. At the end
blank         | 
text          | of the study participants were asked two questions: (1) “How familiar were you with

blank         | 
text          | invest in Sheryl Sandberg’s company (Facebook) than they were in Jeff Weiner’s
blank         | 
text          | company (LinkedIn) when Sheryl Sandberg displayed dominance or no specific type
blank         | 
text          | of agency, they were just as likely to invest in her company as they were Jeff Weiner’s
blank         | 
text          | company when she displayed self-reliance. Thus, a female leader experienced
blank         | 
text          | backlash when she displayed agentic traits related to competition and hierarchy (e.g.
blank         | 
text          | dominance), but did not experience backlash when she displayed agentic traits
blank         | 
text          | unrelated to competition and hierarchy (e.g., self-reliance).
blank         | 
text          |        Study 4 lends greater external validity to the previous findings. Participants
blank         | 
text          | were more willing to invest in Facebook when Sheryl Sandberg displayed self-reliance
blank         | 
text          | than when she did not. That said, by using actual executives at actual Silicon Valley
blank         | 
text          | social media companies, there were differences across conditions that were unrelated
blank         | 
text          | to either the executive’s gender or the type of agency that he or she displayed. For
blank         | 
text          | instance, the executive’s gender was confounded with the executive’s company, the
blank         | 
text          | specific position the executive held in the company, and the specific details of the
blank         | 
text          | executive’s career background. Thus, one could be concerned that one or more of
blank         | 
text          | these differences could account for differences in participants’ perceptions of Sheryl
blank         | 
text          | Sandberg and Jeff Weiner. In particular, one could be concerned that people may have
blank         | 
text          | responded negatively to Sheryl Sandberg when she displayed dominance because it is
blank         | 
text          | seen as less appropriate for a COO to act this way than it is for a CEO. In light of the
blank         | 
text          | previous studies, these potential confounds are less of a concern. In each of the

blank         | 
text          | & Haynes, 2005; Prentice & Carranza, 2002). When they display these agentic traits,
blank         | 
text          | however, they are judged to be too cold, competitive, and untrustworthy to succeed in
blank         | 
text          | these positions (Heilman & Okimoto, 2007; Okimoto & Brescoll, 2010; Rudman &
blank         | 
text          | Glick, 2001). Thus, women often are thought to be trapped in a double bind wherein
blank         | 
text          | no routes exist for them to be judged as well suited for positions of authority. The
blank         | 
text          | present findings suggest that women may be able to escape this double bind by
blank         | 
text          | displaying self-reliance.
blank         | 
text          |        Evidence from four studies supports the idea that self-reliance is a functional
blank         | 
text          | form of agency for women in organizations. Participants were just as inclined to hire
blank         | 
text          | (Study 2), to vote for (Study 3), and to invest in the company of (Study 4) a man that
blank         | 
text          | displayed self-reliance as they were a man that displayed dominance. On the other
blank         | 
text          | hand, participants were more inclined to hire (Study 2), to vote for (Study 3), and to
blank         | 
text          | invest in the company of (Study 4) a women when she displayed self-reliance than
blank         | 
text          | when she displayed dominance. These differences emerged because participants

              | 
              |

blank         | 
text          | they displayed dominance (Studies 1-4). These findings suggest that people perceive
blank         | 
text          | women negatively for displaying agentic traits that are related to competition and
blank         | 
text          | hierarchy (e.g., dominance), but not for displaying agentic traits that are unrelated to
blank         | 
text          | competition and hierarchy (e.g., self-reliance).
blank         | 
text          |        By distinguishing between agentic traits that do and do not relate to
blank         | 
text          | competition and hierarchy, this paper furthers our understanding about when agency
blank         | 
text          | helps and when it hinders women in organizations. Similar to past research (e.g.,
blank         | 
text          | Heilman & Okimoto, 2007; Heilman et al., 2004; Rudman et al., 2012), this paper
blank         | 
text          | found that when women displayed dominance (i.e., agentic traits related to
blank         | 
text          | competition and hierarchy) people were less likely to hire them (Study 2) and less
blank         | 
text          | likely to support their companies (Study 4) than they were to hire and support the
blank         | 
text          | companies of similarly competent men. In contrast to previous research, this paper
blank         | 
text          | found no evidence of backlash against women when they displayed self-reliance
blank         | 
text          | (Studies 1-4). That is, participants were just as inclined to hire and to invest in the
blank         | 
text          | company of a women that displayed self-reliance as they were to hire and to invest in
blank         | 
text          | the company of a man that displayed either dominance or self-reliance. In fact, they
blank         | 
text          | were more likely to vote for a female politician that displayed self-reliance than they
blank         | 
text          | were for a male politician that displayed either dominance or self-reliance (Study 3).
blank         | 
text          | Overall, the present findings suggest that backlash against female leaders stems from
blank         | 
text          | the specific perception that female leaders are dominant and not from the broader
blank         | 
text          | perception that they are agentic. Thus, these findings not only clarify when and why

              | 
              |

title         | Limitations and Future Directions
blank         | 
text          |        Although the present studies provide initial support for the idea that self-
blank         | 
text          | reliance is a functional form of agency for women in organizations, numerous
blank         | 
text          | questions still remain. Many of these questions arise because of limitations with the
blank         | 
text          | present experimental approach. For instance, one limitation is that each study assessed
blank         | 
text          | people’s perceptions of an individual and not their actual behavior toward an
blank         | 
text          | individual. Although people’s attitudes about someone often predict their actions
blank         | 
text          | toward this person (e.g., Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, & Banaji, 2009), the link
blank         | 
text          | between attitudes and behavior can be tenuous (e.g., Ajzen & Fishbein, 1977). The
blank         | 
text          | possibility exists that people behave similarly toward self-reliant and dominant women
blank         | 
text          | even though they express more positive attitudes toward self-reliant women.
blank         | 
text          | Moreover, none of the studies were conducted in an actual organizational context
blank         | 
text          | despite the fact that they purport to test the functional aspects of self-reliance for
blank         | 
text          | women in organizations. This is a limitation of the experimental design because how
blank         | 
text          | people say they would respond and how they actually respond to someone at work
blank         | 
text          | may not be aligned.
blank         | 
text          |        In subsequent research it is vital that I expand the experimental approach and
blank         | 
text          | assess people’s actual behavior toward self-reliant women in an organizational
blank         | 
text          | context. For instance, I could run an audit study in which I send application materials
blank         | 
text          | to actual job postings and see how the gender of the applicant and the type of agency
blank         | 
text          | the applicant displays influence the response rate (see Correll, Benard & Paik, 2007
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
meta          |                                           68
text          | for an example of this approach). Additionally, I could code actual political
blank         | 
text          | candidates’ campaign materials for the degree to which they display self-reliance and
blank         | 
text          | dominance and see how these displays influence the candidates’ political success. I
blank         | 
text          | could draw stronger conclusions about the functional aspects of self-reliance for
blank         | 
text          | women in organizations by employing these types of behavioral and archival studies.
blank         | 
text          |        The present experiments are also limited in their external validity. Each study
blank         | 
text          | explicitly described an individual as either dominant or self-reliant. We rarely receive
blank         | 
text          | such explicit information about a person’s character in day-to-day interactions.
blank         | 
text          | Although we might be told about someone’s personality, or we might read about
blank         | 
text          | someone’s personality on the web, we tend to make inferences about people’s
blank         | 
text          | personalities from their actions. If people are not told explicitly that someone is self-
blank         | 
text          | reliant then how do they infer that he or she is? That is, what behaviors do people use
blank         | 
text          | to infer that someone is or is not self-reliant? In order to answer these questions and to
blank         | 
text          | improve the external validity of the findings, in subsequent research I would like to
blank         | 
text          | determine the behavioral correlates of perceived self-reliance.
blank         | 
text          |        Another potential problem with the current experimental design is that it gives
blank         | 
text          | the impression that displays of self-reliance from women and displays of self-reliance
blank         | 
text          | from men convey the same things to observers. This might be the case, but the
blank         | 
text          | possibility also exists that people perceive self-reliance differently depending on a
blank         | 
text          | person’s gender. There are two findings from the present studies that suggest that self-
blank         | 
text          | reliance carries a different meaning for men and women. First, self-reliance boosted
blank         | 
text          | people’s perceptions of a woman’s trustworthiness, but it did not influence people’s
blank         | 
text          | perceptions of a man’s trustworthiness. Second, people were more likely to vote for a
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
meta          |                                            69
text          | self-reliant female politician than a male politician in Study 3, and people were more
blank         | 
text          | likely to invest in the company of a self-reliant female executive than in the company
blank         | 
text          | of a self-reliant male executive in Study 4. These differences suggest that self-reliance
blank         | 
text          | may send a different signal when a woman displays it than when a man displays it. It
blank         | 
text          | will be important to determine in future research whether the inferences people make
blank         | 
text          | about self-reliant women are different from the inferences that people make about self-
blank         | 
text          | reliant men.
blank         | 
text          |         Because the present studies explicitly described a person as either self-reliant
blank         | 
text          | or dominant, they also don’t speak to how highly self-reliant and highly dominant men
blank         | 
text          | and women actually behave. An important question to ask is whether the same results
blank         | 
text          | emerge if self-reliance and dominance are assessed as individual differences rather
blank         | 
text          | than manipulated as character description. That is, are self-identified self-reliant
blank         | 
text          | women more likely to be hired and more likely to be seen as suited for leadership
blank         | 
text          | positions than self-identified dominant women? In follow-up research, I would like to
blank         | 
text          | assess the extent differences in actual levels of self-reliance and dominance predict
blank         | 
text          | positive organizational outcomes (e.g., emergent leadership, job performance) for men
blank         | 
text          | and women.
blank         | 
text          |        By assessing individual differences in self-reliance, I also hope to determine
blank         | 
text          | whether the characteristics of self-reliant women are different from the characteristics
blank         | 
text          | of self-reliant men. In the same way that it is important to know whether self-reliance
blank         | 
text          | signals the same thing for men and women, it is also important to know whether self-
blank         | 
text          | reliance is the same thing for men and women. Self-reliance may be uniquely
blank         | 
text          | functional for women because self-reliant women are actually fundamentally different
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
meta          |                                            70
text          | from self-reliant men. People may identify as self-reliant for different reasons. For
blank         | 
text          | instance, someone could be self-reliant because they don’t want to or don’t have to
blank         | 
text          | depend on others, or because they can’t be around others. The former
blank         | 
text          | conceptualization is likely perceived as more positive in organizations than the latter
blank         | 
text          | conceptualization. The possibility exists that any differences in observed responses to
blank         | 
text          | self-reliant women and self-reliant men are due to self-reliance being more about not
blank         | 
text          | having to depend on others for women and more about not wanting to be around
blank         | 
text          | others for men. Thus, I would like to explore whether the personality traits and
blank         | 
text          | interpersonal attitudes that are correlated with self-reliance differ for men and women.
blank         | 
text          |        The exclusive use of an online, U.S. based participant pool is another
blank         | 
text          | limitation of the paper. The predictions laid out in this paper arise from a particular
blank         | 
text          | cultural perspective; they may not ring true in other cultural contexts. Similar to the
blank         | 
text          | majority of experimental findings in social psychological and management texts, the
blank         | 
text          | predictions in this paper are rooted in a Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and
blank         | 
text          | democratic context (Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010). Consequently, the present
blank         | 
text          | findings should be interpreted as pertaining only to the context in which they were
blank         | 
text          | tested. Indeed, there is reason to believe that people’s cultural context influences their
blank         | 
text          | responses to men and women that display high levels of agency. First, although there
blank         | 
text          | are cross-cultural similarities in people’s gender stereotypes, these beliefs are far from
blank         | 
text          | universal (Sugihara & Katsurada, 2000; Ward & Sethi, 1986; Wood & Eagly, 2002).
blank         | 
text          | The theoretical rational for backlash against agentic women presupposes that people
blank         | 
text          | hold specific beliefs about the way that men and women should behave. Therefore,
blank         | 
text          | this rationale may be unfitting in contexts where these specific beliefs do not exist.

              | 
meta          |                                            71
text          | Second, the idea that self-reliance is a functional form of agency for women rests on
blank         | 
text          | the assumption that people regard a “desire to be distinct from others” as an
blank         | 
text          | appropriate, or even a respected trait. But, as decades of work from cross-cultural
blank         | 
text          | psychology have shown, there is cross-cultural variability in the extent to which this
blank         | 
text          | trait is valued (Marcus & Kitayama, 1991). If one were to step outside the independent
blank         | 
text          | cultural context in which the studies were conducted, self-reliance may no longer
blank         | 
text          | emerge as a functional form of agency for women. In subsequent research, I would
blank         | 
text          | like to investigate how an individual’s cultural background influences the way in
blank         | 
text          | which he or she responds to highly self-reliant men and women.
blank         | 
text          |        The lack of assessment of the cross-cultural bounds of this paper is part of a
blank         | 
text          | larger limitation. Namely, this paper does not shed light on when self-reliance is likely
blank         | 
text          | to be more or less functional for women. Because the goal of the present work was to
blank         | 
text          | see if people distinguish between self-reliant and dominant women it did not consider
blank         | 
text          | the situations that are likely to reduce or intensify this difference. People preferred to
blank         | 
text          | hire and invest in the company of a self-reliant woman because they saw her as more
blank         | 
text          | trustworthy. This suggests that the preference for self-reliant women should be
blank         | 
text          | diminished in contexts where perceived trustworthiness is less important. Perceived
blank         | 
text          | trustworthiness is especially important in contexts of high interdependence (e.g., when
blank         | 
text          | an employee’s success depends on the work of her colleagues) and high uncertainty
blank         | 
text          | (e.g., when people can behave in multiple ways) (Righett & Finkenauer, 2010). Thus,
blank         | 
text          | in highly independent work environments or in work environments with strong
blank         | 
text          | routines or low autonomy (i.e., low uncertainty), people may be similarly inclined to
blank         | 
text          | hire, to promote, or to want to work with self-reliant and dominant women. Relatedly,
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
meta          |                                            72
text          | self-reliant women may also not be preferred to dominant women in contexts in which
blank         | 
text          | people’s behavior is easily monitored or is very public because, on average, people act
blank         | 
text          | in more trustworthy and benevolent ways when their behavior is visible to others (e.g.,
blank         | 
text          | Haley & Fessler, 2005).
blank         | 
text          |        Trust also tends to get stronger over time and to be stronger with close others
blank         | 
text          | (e.g., ingroup members) than with distant others (e.g., outgroup members) (see
blank         | 
text          | Kramer, 1999). Thus, it stands to reason that the longer people interact with an agentic
blank         | 
text          | woman it will matter less whether she displays self-reliance or dominance. A
blank         | 
text          | limitation of the present studies is that they assessed people’s initial impressions of a
blank         | 
text          | target with whom they were unacquainted. So, it is unclear whether the present
blank         | 
text          | findings would be seen in more long-standing and close relationships. The possibility
blank         | 
text          | exists that overtime people may actually come to prefer dominant women to self-
blank         | 
text          | reliant women. People tend to believe that dominant women are excessively self-
blank         | 
text          | interested (Rudman et al., 2012). If people’s interests, however, are aligned with the
blank         | 
text          | interests of a dominant woman (e.g., because they are members of the same group),
blank         | 
text          | they might come to see her dominance as beneficial. Indeed, dominant women are
blank         | 
text          | actually preferred to non-dominant women in contexts where women have to advocate
blank         | 
text          | for other people (Amanatullah & Morris, 2010; Bowles, Babcock, & McGinn, 2005).
blank         | 
text          | In future research, I would like to assess the ways in which people’s relationships with
blank         | 
text          | dominant and self-reliant women influence their responses to these women in order to
blank         | 
text          | identify the possible temporal and interpersonal bounds of the present findings.
blank         | 
text          |        Although this paper focused on the functional aspects of self-reliance for

text          | Women are judged negatively for displaying dominance in part because acting
blank         | 
text          | dominantly is discordant with women’s perceived lower status. That is, people judge
blank         | 
text          | dominant women as less trustworthy than non-dominant women because they see
blank         | 
text          | dominant women as challenging the social hierarchy (Rudman et al., 2012). If
blank         | 
text          | concerns about the social hierarchy drive negative responses to dominant women, then
blank         | 
text          | it stands to reason that these same concerns drive negative responses to dominant
blank         | 
text          | individuals from other lower status groups. If this were the case then I would expect
blank         | 
text          | that people would judge members of lower status groups to be better suited for
blank         | 
text          | positions of authority when they display self-reliance than when they display
blank         | 
text          | dominance. Thus, I intend to assess in future research if self-reliance is a functional
blank         | 
text          | agentic trait not only for women, but also for members of other lower status groups in
blank         | 
text          | organizations.
blank         | 
title         | Practical Implications
blank         | 
text          |        Given that displaying self-reliance helped women to be seen as well-suited for
blank         | 
text          | leadership positions, future research could investigate the benefits of helping women
blank         | 
text          | to frame their experiences and personality in self-reliant terms. In the present studies,
blank         | 
text          | brief verbal descriptions of a woman’s self-reliance boosted people’s perceptions of
blank         | 
text          | her suitability for leadership positions. It is thus possible that women may increase
blank         | 
text          | their chances of being hired or promoted to a leadership position by simply
blank         | 
text          | emphasizing their self-reliance in a cover letter or during an interview.
blank         | 
text          |        It should be noted that by offering this intervention recommendation, this
blank         | 
text          | paper is offering a target-centered solution to a structural problem. That is, it suggests
blank         | 
text          | ways that the targets of backlash might be able to avoid this backlash. It does not,

text          | however, offer a solution for eradicating the source of this backlash. In doing so, it
blank         | 
text          | may unduly put the burden of dealing with the problem on the shoulders of the people
blank         | 
text          | who are victims of the problem. Backlash against agentic women stems from long-
blank         | 
text          | standing structural gender inequities and negative gender stereotypes. Thus,
blank         | 
text          | subsequent work might benefit from focusing on the factors that may mitigate these
blank         | 
text          | structural inequities and negative gender stereotypes. It should be further noted that by
blank         | 
text          | suggesting that backlash against female leaders arises only when female leaders
blank         | 
text          | display agentic traits related to competition and hierarchy this paper does not mean to
blank         | 
text          | suggest that backlash is not an issue for women in the workplace. Given that women
blank         | 
text          | still face backlash when they display dominance, they have fewer open routes for
blank         | 
text          | demonstrating their agency than men, and thus may still be disadvantaged when it
blank         | 
text          | comes to being seen as well suited for leadership positions.
blank         | 
text          |                                       Conclusion
blank         | 
text          |        A bleak picture is often painted for women in organizations. It suggests that no
blank         | 
text          | matter what women do they will fail to be seen as well suited for positions of
blank         | 
text          | leadership. The fact that self-reliance is a form of agency that helps women may
blank         | 
text          | repaint this picture with brighter hues. Although structural inequalities and gender
blank         | 
text          | stereotypes make the path to leadership harder for women, the path may not be as
blank         | 
text          | treacherous as often assumed.
