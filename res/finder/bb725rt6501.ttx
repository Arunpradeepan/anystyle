text          | This work describes the application of palladium-based composite membrane reactors
              | (MRs) for performing steam methane reforming (SMR) and natural gas steam
              | reforming reactions to produce a high-purity hydrogen stream for CO2 capture from
              | the transportation sector. In particular, the effect of different operating conditions on
              | the performance of several MRs has been investigated. Moreover, thin pure palladium
              | and palladium-gold alloy membranes have been synthesized via electroless plating and
              | housed in the membrane module for reaction and permeation testing.

              | 
text          | In particular, the SMR reaction across porous stainless steel-supported Pd membranes
              | has been investigated with a focus on low temperature and pressure conditions to
              | showcase the ability of the MR to obtain high conversions even at mild conditions.
              | The feed composition ratio, i.e., H2O/CH4, was kept above the stoichiometric limit to
              | enhance conversion, while a permeate sweep gas was used to promote the permeation
              | of hydrogen through the membrane. This application of the Pd-based MR resulted in
              | high methane conversion (84%) and hydrogen recovery (82%) with a pure hydrogen
              | stream obtained from the permeate side at temperatures as low as 400 °C. Stable
              | methane conversions and hydrogen permeation rates were obtained for > 700 reaction
              | hours. Using a Pd-Au composite MR, further reaction testing took place with a real
              | natural gas feed at 450 °C and 300 kPa. This MR operated under a SMR reaction
              | continuously for > 250 hours without a decrease in performance, highlighting the
              | long-term stability of the MR to produce pure hydrogen for long periods of time. More
              | specifically, the conversion of higher hydrocarbons, e.g., propane, ethane, and butane,
              | within the reactor were > 85% throughout the experimental tests.

text          | Using a membrane module comprised of a dense Pd77Ag23 membrane, hydrogen
              | permeation decreased when exposed to H2S. This decrease in hydrogen flux was
              | temporary and complete recovery was realized with 200 ppm and 40 ppm H2S

text          | World power generation is largely comprised of fossil fuels use and within the U.S.
              | specifically, these non-renewable sources make up 80% of energy resources, with
              | natural gas being the largest growing fossil fuel at approximately 2% per year (EIA
              | 2015). The use of all these fossil fuels leads to a significant amount of CO2 being
              | released into the atmosphere. Within the U.S. alone, the carbon emissions in 2015
              | associated with electricity generation were ~ 2 Gigatonnes with natural gas making up
              | 28%. One potential solution to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil sources is through
              | researching alternative pathways with increased efficiency and subsequently fewer
              | emissions (Raupach et al. 2007, Peters et al. 2012, Edenhofer et al. 2014). As a
              | potential energy carrier, hydrogen (H2) has the ability to meet these needs with a high
              | energy density and zero end-use greenhouse gas emissions (Mazloomi et al. 2012).
              | While it is possible to produce hydrogen from renewable sources, with many different
              | methods and technologies still under development (Iulianelli et al. 2012, Acar et al.
              | 2014, Naterer et al. 2014, Tremel et al. 2015), hydrogen production primarily comes
              | from natural gas steam reforming, where the main reaction is steam reforming of
              | methane (SMR) (Abbas et al. 2010).

              | 
text          | The leading industrial process for natural gas reforming is characterized by a multi-
              | step process in which hydrogen is produced under harsh operating conditions, i.e., 800
              | – 1000 °C and 1.5 – 2.0 MPa (Rostrup-Nielsen 1984, Rostrup-Nielsen et al. 2002) due
              | to thermodynamic constraints and then separated and purified by other energy-
              | intensive steps such as pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or cryogenic distillation.
              | However, as reported by several other studies (Oertel et al. 1987, Jørgensen et al.
              | 1995, Kikuchi 2000, Matsumura et al. 2004), it is possible to perform the SMR
              | reaction at milder operating conditions, i.e., < 500 °C by overcoming the
              | thermodynamic constraints by using membrane reactor (MR) technology. In
              | particular, the use of a Pd-based MR allows for the continuous removal of hydrogen,

text          | owing to the complete selectivity of the Pd membrane towards hydrogen permeation,
              | shifting the SMR reaction towards further product formation and consequently
              | yielding an increase in conversion (Gryaznov 1986, Itoh 1987). This effect is known
              | as a “shift effect.”
blank         | 
              | 
text          | The ability of the Pd-based MR to enhance the reaction performance in terms of
              | conversion under fixed operating conditions is inversely proportional to the membrane
              | thickness. In particular, the thinner the metallic layer deposited on the porous support,
              | the higher the hydrogen permeation flux. This produces a more pronounced shift
              | effect, which induces an increase in conversion. Therefore, even at low operating
              | temperatures of 400 °C, there is significant improvement in conversion achieved using
              | a Pd-based MR. More specifically, (Kikuchi et al. 1991) measured a CH4 conversion
              | of 64% at 400 °C compared to the calculated equilibrium value of < 20% for a fixed
              | bed reactor (FBR) at the same operating conditions (Liu et al. 2002, Schädel et al.
              | 2009). This high conversion of CH4 leads to co-benefits of the MR technology, i.e., a
              | pure hydrogen stream collected on the permeate side of the membrane with zero
              | emissions if the pure hydrogen is fed to a proton exchange membrane fuel cell
              | (PEMFC) (Bredesen et al. 2004, Atsonios et al. 2012, Abanades et al. 2015) as well as
              | a high composition of CO2 in the retentate side that can be captured to mitigate carbon
              | emissions.

text          | A challenge in using pure Pd membranes is hydrogen embrittlement, which is caused
              | by the large distortion in the lattice structure due to the α−β phase transformation at
              | operating temperatures below ~ 300 °C (Hunter 1960, Grashoff et al. 1983). This
              | irreversible process takes place when the cyclic stress is present by adsorption and
              | desorption of hydrogen and the palladium becomes very brittle. This mechanical
              | instability is somewhat decreased when alloying with other metals such as Ag, Ru, Rh,
              | or other rare-earth elements. In particular, the addition of Ag to Pd gives a highly
              | stabilizing effect, thereby mitigating the embrittlement phenomenon. Moreover, it has
              | been shown that Pd/Ag with 20 to 25 wt.% silver allowed for achieving up to two

text          | The ability of Pd-based membranes to produce pure hydrogen on a larger scale, i.e., ~
              | 3.5 kg/hour, has been proven to be energetically viable with energy efficiencies (i.e.,
              | HHV) matching current industrial-scale production (Shirasaki et al. 2009). This same
              | MR hydrogen production plant had only a 3% decrease in energy efficiency (HHV)
              | when 50% of the carbon dioxide emissions where captured and liquefy (Kurokawa et
              | al. 2011). This significant added benefit of using a Pd-based MR is related to the high
              | partial pressure of carbon dioxide within the retentate, i.e., > 70%, which minimizes
              | the work needed for its utilization (Shirasaki et al. 1997, Wilcox 2012). Dependence
              | on fossil-based fuels will continue for decades to come; however, if there are
              | sustainable means to utilize the built infrastructure then there is a possibility that a
              | higher portion of power generation could be associated with renewable sources in the

text          | Chapter 3 elaborates on the methodology of the experimental tests and gives great
              | detail to the calibration of the equipment used, i.e., mass spectrometer. Detailed
              | descriptions of the experimental setups and equipment used can be found throughout
              | the chapter relating to the FBR and MR tests. Chapter 4 highlights the practicality of
              | using a catalyst as a combined methane storage and reaction material. The ability to
              | use the catalyst as a sorbent for methane storage allows for a smaller on-board layout
              | given higher densities can be achieved for an absorbed gas relative to standard
              | conditions. Data obtained relating to pore size distribution and surface area for the
              | catalyst both fresh and after reaction testing are discussed. Chapter 5 shows the
              | experimental data obtained for an FBR replicating industrial operating conditions.
              | Three different configurations are discussed for the purpose of maximizing hydrogen
              | production while mitigating carbon monoxide production. This chapter serves as a
              | performance baseline to be used as a comparison for the MR technology. Chapter 6
              | demonstrates the experimental use of Pd-based membranes for achieving initial
              | hydrogen permeation data and serves as a benchmark for membrane characteristics to
              | be referenced in the chapters that follow. Chapter 7 shows experimental results related
              | to the SMR reaction in a Pd-based porous stainless steel (PSS) supported MR for the
              | purpose of hydrogen production. The first part of this chapter is under review for
              | publication in the Journal of Membrane Science (2016). The second part of this
              | chapter reports experimental data that did not make it into the article, but added value
              | related to post reaction analysis of the pure Pd composite membrane used.

              | operating conditions. These experimental tests were conducted at the Institute on
              | Membrane Technology, which is part of the National Research Council in Italy. The
              | second part of the chapter shows results obtained from further experimental testing
              | and is part of a paper recently published in Molecules, a peer-reviewed open-access
              | journal (Iulianelli et al. 2016). Chapter 10 discusses data from natural gas steam
              | reforming within a Pd-Au composite membrane. This chapter is especially important
              | given that the natural gas is pipeline quality and demonstrates the ability of the MR

              | tolerate exposure to hydrogen sulfide. Sulfur containing species are found naturally
              | within natural gas and while desulfurization equipment allows for adequate removal of

text          | This literature review outlines the current state of hydrogen in terms of scale and best-
              | known commercial practices. An in-depth analysis of the prevailing method for
              | producing hydrogen via steam methane reforming (SMR) will be discussed. Coupled
              | with the production of hydrogen will be the prevailing commercial technologies that
              | are used for the purification of hydrogen. Limitations of these industrial technologies
              | along with the catalysts used for steam reforming will be analyzed and investigated.
              | This review will also give a thorough review of an alternative technology using
              | palladium-based membranes. The use of a Pd membrane with a catalyst bed is a well-
              | known technology and is known as a membrane reactor (MR). This technology allows
              | for enhanced conversion of the feed stream, at lower operating conditions
              | (temperature and pressure) than the current industrial process. This technology has
              | been heavily investigated and Figure 2.1 shows the number of Pd-based MR
              | publications as well as Pd-based MRs specifically using methane, plotted against the

              | Energy (USDoE) Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Program. Funding in this area reached a
              | high of approximately $270 million in the fiscal years 2007 – 2009, but has since
              | decreased to a budget of $115 million for the fiscal year 2015 with a requested amount

              | following this period (Administration 2008). Based on historical data of the USDoE

text          | Determining the hydrogen production capacity currently available is one method to
              | analyze the size of the current US hydrogen marketplace. Natural gas reforming is the
              | primary method of hydrogen production in the US, with 1,330 million standard cubic
              | feet per day (scfd) (0.031 million tonnes per day) of hydrogen produced from 510
              | million scfd of methane in 2014, which accounts for 95% of the total hydrogen market
              | (García 2015). In contrast, the US market production of natural gas in 2014 was over
              | 70,000 million cubic feet per day, over 50 times that of the hydrogen production
              | market (Administration 2016). Estimates in 2008 place the 2006 total US hydrogen
              | production capacity at 10.5 million tonnes (or 4,153,000 million scf), 7 million tonnes
              | designated for direct use in chemical processes after production, and 3.5 million

              | industrial process for natural gas reforming is characterized by a multi-step system in
              | which hydrogen is produced under harsh operating conditions, i.e., 800 – 1000 °C and
              | 1.5 to 2.0 MPa (Rostrup-Nielsen 1984, Rostrup-Nielsen et al. 2002) followed by

text          | This process, first explained by Tessie du Motat and Marechal in 1868, passes
              | hydrocarbons over a catalytic bed, in the presence of steam, to produce H2 (Motat
              | 1867, Adris et al. 1996). Although this process had been discovered, it was not until
              | the 1930’s that the first industrial steam reformer was installed using methane,
              | naphtha, and No. 2 fuel oil (i.e., heating oil) (Hoyt 1869). Over the years, steam
              | reforming has developed into specifically tailored processes, each with their own
              | unique sets of reactions across individual fixed catalytic beds. More specifically, the
              | hydrocarbon feed enters the SMR reactor at ~1.5 MPa and at a temperature of ~900
              | °C. This endothermic reaction, i.e., Eq. 2.1, is thermodynamically favored at elevated
              | temperatures; however, high pressure negatively affects the reaction due to its
              | stoichiometry. These negative effects on the SMR reaction are overcome through
              | industrialized optimization; that is the overall production of hydrogen is favored at
              | elevated pressures (De Falco et al. 2011).

text          | Following the reformer the primary products, of which are ~ 76 mol% H2, ~ 13 mol%
              | CH4, ~ 12 mol% CO and ~ 10 mol% CO2 on a dry basis (Rostrup-Nielsen 1984,
              | Barelli et al. 2008, Roses et al. 2013), undergo a secondary reaction, i.e., water-gas
              | shift (WGS), Eq. 2.2, to further increase the hydrogen yield while decreasing the CO
              | content. Optimized with the use of catalysts, high-temperature (HT) shift occurs
              | between 300 and 400 °C, but the low temperature (LT) shift may occur near 200 °C.
              | The WGS is an exothermic reaction that is promoted at lower temperature, but is
              | kinetically limited at temperatures below ~ 200 °C (Newsome 1980, Chen et al. 2008,
              | De Falco et al. 2011). This separation by temperature allows the WGS reaction to

              | For an industrial SMR plant, the outlet stream from the final water-gas shift reactor
              | will enter the H2 purification unit. The typical composition of gases entering the
              | purification unit are 86% H2, 12% CO2, 0.4% CO and 1.6% CH4 on a dry basis (Kirk-
              | Othmer 1999). The most extensively used technology for large-scale H2 production is
              | pressure swing adsorption (PSA) (Adhikari et al. 2006). The PSA process allows H2 to
              | pass through, creating an enriched stream of H2 gas, while CO2 and other undesired
              | trace gases are absorbed. The PSA unit operates at about 20 to 25 bar (Amphlett et al.
              | 1996, Damen et al. 2006) and has a hydrogen separation efficiency (amount of high-
              | purity H2 produced with regard to the total amount of H2 in the feed) of 85-90%
              | (Chiesa et al. 2005, Häussinger et al. 2012). The PSA technology has the ability to
              | process large capacities on the order of 100,000 m3/h (Sharma 2009, Häussinger et al.
              | 2012) while maintaining a hydrogen purity of 99.99+% (Armor 1998, Damen et al.
              | 2006, Sjardin et al. 2006, Lu et al. 2007, Häussinger et al. 2012). To put the capacity
              | of PSA in perspective, a 100,000-m3/h unit, running 24 hours/day 365 days/year,
              | would produce 78,000 tonnes of H2 per year, which amounts to approximately 0.2% of
              | annual global H2 production. Most of the CO2 that is produced during this process is
              | vented and discarded with some being purified and sold as a pure gas (Rostrup-
              | Nielsen 1984).

text          | The industrial SMR process is used to produce hydrogen via large-scale units with an
              | efficiency of 80 to 85% (calculated as HHV of H2 divided by the HHV of CH4 along
              | with the power needed for auxiliaries, i.e. pumping, etc.), before compression
              | (Simbolotti 2007). This efficiency is the ratio of produced hydrogen, net heat, and the
              | total heat required for the entire process, i.e., furnace, reformer, steam, shift reactions
              | and PSA. In general, the maximum efficiency may be achieved by minimizing the use

text          | The catalyst within the respective reactor beds allows for an alternate path with a
              | lower energy barrier to be taken on the potential energy surface of a given reaction,
              | thereby speeding up the rate of chemical reaction. For the SMR reaction, an oxide
              | supports the active metal of the catalyst with examples of catalyst supports including
              | alumina oxide, magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, and titanium dioxide (Van Beurden
              | 2004). The active metal used on these supports may be one or a combination of
              | ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, platinum, or nickel as well as several others (Wei et
              | al. 2004). Some parameters that are used in choosing an appropriate metal for a
              | catalyst are its activity toward conversion of reactants to products, ability to resist
              | deactivation, availability, cost and thermal stability (Rostrup-Nielsen 1984). One
              | active metal in particular that is widely used due mostly to availability and cost is
              | nickel, even though it is less active and is more readily affected by the formation of
              | coke compared to the other active metals (Christensen et al. 2006, Guo et al. 2012).
              | Figure 2.3A, based on literature, shows just how widely used Ni is for the SMR
              | reaction. There is a significant amount of literature devoted to improvements of all
              | metal-based catalysts by way of resistance to sintering and coke formation
              | (Matsumura et al. 2004, Sehested et al. 2004, Maluf et al. 2009, Mbodji et al. 2012,
              | Nieva et al. 2014). Also, given the importance of Ni as an active metal, there is a large
              | amount of literature on improvements to the support and the addition of promoters
              | (Luna et al. 1999, Zhao 2004, Foletto et al. 2006, Dan et al. 2012, Roh et al. 2012).

text          | The catalysts found to be useful for the WGS reaction are based on Au, Ce, Cu, Cr,
              | Co, Fe, Ni, Pt, and Zn as well as other oxides (Grenoble et al. 1981, Bunluesin et al.
              | 1998, Mendes et al. 2010). Figure 2.3B shows a breakdown of the different catalysts
              | currently used. It is evident that the leading catalysts used are based on Cu-Zn and Fe-
              | Cr; however, continued research to improve WGS catalysts through the use of gold as
              | the active metal supported on various oxides is encouraging (Andreeva 2002,
              | Andreeva et al. 2002, Hashmi et al. 2006). In particular, for industrial use the most
              | commonly used catalyst for high temperature, i.e., 300 to 400 °C, is iron-chrome oxide
              | (Fe3O4/Cr2O3) and for low temperature, i.e., 200 to 250 °C, is copper-zinc oxide
              | (CuZn/Al2O3) (Newsome 1980, Li et al. 2000, Ratnasamy et al. 2009). Although the
              | equilibrium conversion is greater at lower temperatures, due to the exothermic nature
              | of the WGS reaction, the catalytic reaction rate increases with temperature. Thus, as

              | WGS catalyst for high throughput and CO mitigation, a two-step process is used.

title         | 2.2.2 Limitations of the industrial SMR Process
blank         | 
text          | The current SMR industrial process is thermodynamically limited due to the fixed
              | catalyst bed across which the endothermic SMR and exothermic WGS reactions take
              | place. It is well known that the most significant restriction related to the SMR process
              | is the thermodynamic limit, which requires high operating temperature and pressure
              | for realizing complete conversion. Moreover, at these conditions, the catalyst may
              | become deactivated due to carbon formation thereby causing an increase in pressure
              | drop across the catalytic bed as well as localized heating, which can cause mechanical
              | failure of the metal walls supporting the catalyst bed. Therefore, in order to avoid the
              | high-energy requirement and catalyst fouling, a MR technology can be adopted.
              | Indeed, several scientific studies have previously demonstrated the feasibility of this

title         | 2.3 Membrane reactor
blank         | 
text          | As discussed in Section 2.2.2, a MR has the ability to overcome the thermodynamic
              | constraints of a FBR system. Two different leading reforming reactor configurations
              | have been investigated previously such as a Packed Bed Membrane Reactor (PBMR)
              | and a Fluidized Bed Membrane Reactor (FBMR) with the most studied MR
              | configuration being the PBMR. The first studies investigated the membrane
              | permeation characteristics and demonstrated that the MR could be a reliable
              | alternative to FBRs. In the PBMR, where the configuration may be tubular or planar,
              | the catalyst is confined in a fixed arrangement and is in contact with the membrane
              | surface. Regarding the FBMR, a typical configuration consists of a bundle of
              | membranes immersed in a catalytic bed operating in the bubbling or turbulent regime.
              | A representative FBMR was proposed previously by (Adris et al. 1994).
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Each configuration, i.e., PBMR and FBMR, have their benefits and drawbacks. In
              | particular, the PBMR is characterized by a very simple configuration in which the
              | catalyst particles can be packed. The particle dimensions play an important role for the
              | performance of this kind of reactor. Indeed, very small particles will increase the
              | pressure drop, and on the contrary, larger particles may limit the internal mass
              | transfer. Moreover, other drawbacks can occur by using the PBMR such as the mass-
              | transfer limitations from the bed to walls, which negatively influences hydrogen
              | permeation and the temperature profile along the reactor, with a consequent
              | detrimental effect on both the catalyst and membrane (Roses et al. 2013).
              | Alternatively, the FBMR provides some benefits over PBMRs such as higher catalyst
              | effectiveness and enhanced mass and heat transfer rates, favoring a more uniform
              | temperature profile. On the contrary, the main drawback is the minimum fluidization
              | velocity, which is required for maintaining the suspension of the catalyst bed.
              | Moreover, the bubbles present can cause back mixing of the gas and possible mass-
              | transfer limitations, which can negatively affect the conversion of methane.

text          | Using a membrane reactor (MR) with a hydrogen-selective membrane allows for an
              | enhanced feed conversion by selectively removing H2 from the product stream of the
              | equilibrium-limited chemical reaction. As reported by several studies (Oertel et al.
              | 1987, Jørgensen et al. 1995, Kikuchi 2000, Matsumura et al. 2004), it is possible to
              | overcome the thermodynamic constraints and perform the SMR reaction at milder
              | operating conditions by using MR technology. In particular, the use of the Pd-based
              | MR allows for the continuous removal of H2, due to the complete selectivity of the Pd
              | membrane towards hydrogen permeation, shifting the reactions, Eq. 2.1 – 2.3, towards
              | further products formation and, consequently, yielding an increase in conversion
              | (Gryaznov 1986, Itoh 1987). This effect is known as the “shift effect.” A schematic of
              | a Pd-based MR is shown in Figure 2.5.

text          | performance in terms of conversion under fixed operating conditions is inversely
              | proportional to the membrane thickness. In particular, the thinner the metallic layer
              | deposited on the porous support, the higher the hydrogen permeating flux. This
              | produces a more pronounced shift effect, which leads to an increase in conversion;
              | therefore, even at low operating temperatures, e.g., 400 °C, significant improvement
              | over equilibrium conditions can be achieved using a Pd-based MR. For example,
              | Kikuchi et al. (1991) measured a CH4 conversion of 64% at 400 °C whereas, from Liu
              | et al. (2002), Schädel et al. (2009) the calculated equilibrium value was < 20% for a
              | fixed bed reactor (FBR) at the same operating conditions. This high CH4 conversion
              | leads to co-benefits of the MR technology, i.e., a pure hydrogen stream coming from
              | the permeate stream and a retentate stream rich in CO2, which has the potential to
              | mitigate the environmental impact of hydrogen production (Bredesen et al. 2004,
              | Atsonios et al. 2012, Abanades et al. 2015). The MRs used in this work were PBMRs
              | with variations to the palladium-based membranes. For simplicity, the PBMR used
              | throughout this work will be referred to as a MR.

text          | To better understand the use of palladium for hydrogen-selective membranes it is
              | important to appreciate the history of their development. The capacity of palladium to
              | absorb hydrogen was first discovered by Thomas Graham in 1866 (Graham 1866),
              | which lead the way for the development of dense unsupported Pd membranes with an
              | initial thickness on the order of millimeters (Barrer 1940). These membranes were
              | characterized by low hydrogen permeability and high cost (Silberg et al. 1958,
              | Hurlbert et al. 1961, Itoh 1987, Schramm et al. 1999, Paglieri et al. 2002). Over the
              | decades, tubular dense unsupported Pd-based membranes have significantly decreased
              | in thickness, i.e., < 50 µm and in cost, increased in hydrogen permeability and as a
              | negative effect reduced in their mechanical resistance (Shu et al. 1993, Tosti et al.
              | 2000). However, over the last decade, composite membranes comprised of a thin Pd
              | layer deposited onto a porous support were developed with higher hydrogen
              | permeability, mechanical resistance and lower cost than unsupported membranes

text          | (Mardilovich et al. 1998, Gade et al. 2008, Catalano et al. 2012). The dominant
              | support materials used for the deposition of the metallic layer are ceramic and porous
              | stainless steel (PSS) although other substrates exist (Masuda et al. 1994, Soria 1995,
              | Yeung et al. 1995, Kikuchi 2000, Di Marcoberardino et al. 2015). PSS supports have
              | the undesirable attributes of broad nominal pore size and irregular surface area.
              | Moreover, their long-term stability is negatively affected by the metallic inter-
              | diffusion of the Pd layer with the metal. Nevertheless, their mechanic durability,
              | thermal expansion coefficient that is similar to Pd, and ease of integration because of
              | their weldability make them highly suitable as a support for Pd deposition (Edlund et
              | al. 1995, Ma et al. 2003). In addition, several techniques exist as a feasible remedy for

title         | 2.4.1 Limitations of Pd-based metallic membranes
text          | One of the limitations of Pd as a hydrogen-selective membrane is its structure owing
              | to the coexistence of α- and β-phases, inducing mismatches in the Pd lattices in the
              | presence of hydrogen below the critical temperature of 293 °C (Flanagan et al. 1991,
              | Paglieri et al. 2002). This phenomena known as, hydrogen embrittlement, refers to the
              | mechanical failure of metals (often compared with steel) because of exposure to
              | hydrogen. Hydrogen can be absorbed within the metal crystal structure, thereby
              | inducing mechanical strain and fracture (Uemiya et al. 1991, McCool et al. 2001, Tosti
              | et al. 2006, Zhang et al. 2012).
blank         | 
              | 
text          | In addition, the surface of a Pd membrane is susceptible to poisoning by contaminants
              | in the gas stream, such as sulfur and carbon impurities. Hydrogen sulfide, at
              | concentrations as low as 5 to 10 ppm, readily adsorbs onto the Pd surface due to the
              | chemical nature of the strong metal-sulfur bond and, as a result, hydrogen dissociation
              | may be substantially inhibited due to the lack of active sites available on the surface
              | (Mckinley 1967, Gao et al. 2004, Mundschau et al. 2006, Ozdogan et al. 2010). This
              | surface inhibition, described in more detail in Chapter 11, may be the dominant
              | mechanism of sulfur poisoning, but severe sulfur exposure may lead to bulk sulfide
              | formation causing irreversible damage to the membrane (Dunleavy 2006). This could
              | be a significant drawback in the case of using syngas from coal gasification or natural
              | gas for reforming, which commonly contains a concentration of hundreds of ppm
              | (Douglas 1990) to several percent H2S (Porter 1970). In order to reduce the sulfur
              | content suitable for Pd-based membrane operation, pre-desulfurization may be
              | required. Sulfur-resistant alloy membrane materials may also alleviate the impact of
              | sulfur, as discussed in the Pd-alloy section 2.6 of this chapter. In addition to sulfur

title         | 2.5 Hydrogen transport mechanism in palladium
blank         | 
text          | Generally, at constant temperature, hydrogen transport through dense metallic
              | membranes takes place by a solution-diffusion mechanism. Hydrogen molecules
              | dissociate on the high-pressure side of the membrane (feed) into atoms of hydrogen,
              | which subsequently diffuse through the crystal structure of the dense metal. The
              | hydrogen atoms recombine and desorb molecularly on the low-pressure side of the
              | membrane (permeate), with the residue (retentate) from the feed stream exiting the
              | membrane system. The mass-transfer rate, or flux, of hydrogen permeating through
              | the membrane is proportional to the hydrogen partial pressure gradient across the
              | membrane as follows:
blank         | 
text          |            Eq. 2.4             J H 2 = Pe ( pHn 2 ,retentate − pHn 2 , permeate ) / δ

text          | where !!! is the hydrogen permeating flux through the membrane, Pe is the
              | permeability, !!! is the partial pressure of hydrogen in either the retentate or permeate
              | side, n is the dependent factor that relates the hydrogen partial pressure to its flux and
              | varies between 0.5 to 1.0, and δ is the thickness of the membrane. A schematic of the

text          | The rate-limiting step of hydrogen permeation through a membrane, with a thickness

text          | Diffusion limitations are minimized as n approaches unity, i.e., when the operating
              | pressures are high or when the membrane thickness is small, i.e., < 1µm [(Ward et al.
              | 1999).

              | 
text          | When the metallic layer is imperfect, i.e., not completely dense, the flow of a gas
              | across the membrane can take place through pinhole defects. This may cause the value
              | of n in Eq. 2.4 to deviate from 0.5 and could approach unity (Knudsen 1995). An
              | imperfect metallic layer can form for various reasons that are dependent on several

text          | The permeability is a potentially tunable parameter that is solely dependent on
              | material properties. In general, the diffusivity is a kinetic parameter measuring the rate
              | of atomic hydrogen diffusion, whereas the solubility is related to the thermodynamic
              | equilibrium of the metal-hydrogen system (Ockwig et al. 2007). The diffusivity and
              | solubility can be theoretically determined with the ideal solution assumption at
              | sufficiently low hydrogen concentrations, where the hydrogen-hydrogen interaction in
              | the dissolved phase is negligible (Ockwig et al. 2007). The permeability is sensitive to
              | temperature change since diffusivity and solubility vary with temperature. The
              | diffusivity generally increases as temperature increases unless a phase transformation
              | occurs within the associated temperature range, while the solubility trend with

              | diffusivity is substantially higher than the decrease in solubility. In the case of Group 5

              | because the solubility also decreases substantially (Buxbaum et al. 1996, Lee et al.

text          | Pd alloy-based membranes have gained increasing interest in the literature due to their
              | improved properties compared to pure Pd membranes such as sulfur resistivity,
              | thermal stability and enhanced hydrogen permeability, as well as their lower material
              | cost. Table 2.2 shows the hydrogen permeabilities of various Pd-based membranes
              | reported recently in the literature. One of most widely studied Pd-based alloy
              | membranes is Pd-Ag, some of which are applied to the MR technology (Peters et al.
              | 2008, Borgognoni et al. 2011, Brunetti et al. 2012). The Pd-Ag membranes can
              | provide 1.5 to 2 times higher hydrogen permeability compared to Pd membranes due
              | to their increased hydrogen solubility. The most widely used alloy for commercial
              | units is Pd77Ag23, which has 1.7 times the H2 permeability of pure Pd at temperatures
              | in the range of 300 to 450 °C (Young 1963, Knapton 1977); however, while less
              | affected by CO exposure (Wilhite et al. 2004), can suffer from grain coarsening at
              | elevated temperatures above 350 °C (Hobbis et al. 1956). In addition, Pd-Ag
              | membranes have demonstrated higher resistance against hydrogen embrittlement, and
              | therefore are not limited to operating at temperatures above ~ 300 °C, as is the case
              | with pure Pd membranes (Section 2.4.1), and have been shown to avoid embrittlement
              | even at room temperature.

text          | Aside from enhancing membrane transport properties, another purpose of alloying is
              | to improve chemical stability against sulfur contamination. The alloy Pd-Cu, 35-45
              | wt.% of Cu, has higher tolerance against sulfur contamination, with a permeability that
              | is similar or slightly lower than that of pure Pd. The face-centered cubic (FCC) phase
              | of the Pd-Cu alloy containing 20-47 wt.% Cu has been found to have increased
              | tolerance against sulfur poisoning when compared to the body-centered cubic (BCC)
              | phase of the same alloy, in which hydrogen permeability has been found to remain
              | constant given 1000 ppm H2S exposure (Morreale 2004). The extent of sulfur
              | tolerance varies among the studies reported in the literature. For instance, a
              | concentration of 300 ppm of H2S completely inhibited hydrogen permeation through
              | Pd-60Cu membranes whereas only 100 ppm of H2S inhibited permeation in pure Pd
              | membranes (Kulprathipanja et al. 2005). In addition, 80%, 20% and 1% losses in
              | hydrogen permeation were reported for various Pd-Cu membranes of 8, 18 and 19
              | wt.% at 50 ppm, 20 ppm and 5 ppm H2S, respectively (Mundschau et al. 2006,
              | Pomerantz et al. 2009, Gharibi et al. 2013). Since these experimental results have been
              | compiled from different studies, the effect of the H2S concentration may not appear to
              | be quantitatively correlated with the permeation drop, but the overall trend
              | qualitatively shows the inhibiting effect of H2S.

text          | In addition, Pd-Au alloy membranes with low Au compositions (i.e., < 10 wt.%) have
              | also shown enhanced sulfur resistance (Braun et al. 2014). Hydrogen permeation
              | dropped to 15% of the initial flux at 55 ppm H2S for a Pd-10Au membrane, but soon
              | recovered to 60% with hydrogen purging, whereas the hydrogen permeation through a
              | pure Pd membrane was reduced to 10% of its initial flux under the same H2S
              | concentration, without recovering after hydrogen purging (Chen et al. 2010).

              | compositions between 10 to 30 wt.% were 20 – 60% less permeable than pure Pd,
              | while demonstrating improved sulfur tolerance; for instance, a 30% permeation loss

text          | Non-precious metal alloys for hydrogen separation have been studied as a way to
              | reduce the use of precious metals. A range of hydrogen permeabilities for the non-Pd
              | membranes from the literature is listed in Table 2.3. Research on non-palladium based
              | membranes started with the first amorphous metal alloy membrane, a Zr36Ni64 alloy
              | introduced by Hara et al., demonstrating 12 times lower hydrogen flux but 31 times
              | reduced cost compared to Pd77Ag23 (Hara et al. 2000, Dolan et al. 2009). Hydrogen
              | permeabilities tend to increase along with the Zr content in amorphous metal alloys
              | (Yamaura et al. 2005, Dolan et al. 2009). Superior hydrogen permeability may also be
              | achieved by using crystalline alloys of the early transition metals having a BCC crystal
              | structure, such as the Group 5 metals (e.g., V, Nb, and Ta) (Buxbaum et al. 1993,
              | Buxbaum et al. 1996, Phair et al. 2006). It should be noted that the presence of a
              | catalytic Pd layer is often required for such high permeation levels of hydrogen
              | through these metals. Group 5 metals have high surface resistance for hydrogen entry

text          | The increased permeability of the crystalline and amorphous metal alloys, found in
              | Table 2.3, i.e. Nb42Ni32Zr20Co6, can be largely attributed to their high hydrogen
              | solubility (Dolan 2010). However, high solubility is often correlated to the
              | membrane’s susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement. As the hydrogen concentration
              | rises, the precipitation of new hydride phases occurs, and the stress along phase
              | boundaries potentially increases, leading to defects and cracks (Dolan 2010). To
              | reduce the embrittlement induced by the formation of dual phases, alloying with
              | metals that have less hydrogen solubility, such as Ni, has been reported in the
              | literature (Amano et al. 1991, Nishimura et al. 1991, Ozaki et al. 2003, Dolan et al.
              | 2011, Yukawa et al. 2011). It was found that the presence additive metals that absorb
              | less hydrogen suppress the formation of hydride phases, thereby limiting hydrogen
              | embrittlement.

text          | Another important property of membrane materials is thermal stability for high-

              | continues with non-Pd-based membranes since the impact of these new membranes on

title         | 2.8.1 Chemical Vapor Deposition
blank         | 
text          | The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process is the decomposition of a volatile
              | compound to be used for deposition on a heated surface. The CVD method takes
              | advantage of a material that has a sublimation temperature below its decomposition
              | temperature (Wachtman et al. 1992). A typical CVD process entails sublimating the
              | metallic material and transporting the vapor via a carrier gas for deposition on the
              | surface that is either heated or chemically reacted to form a continuous film with the
              | desired thickness (Choy 2003). A major benefit of CVD is that it has the ability to
              | deposit metal within the porous support as opposed to only the surface of the support,
              | potentially making a thinner metallic layer completely selective towards H2. One
              | modification to CVD is metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, MOCVD, which
              | only differs in the compound used for sublimation, i.e., an organometallic compound
              | (Jones et al. 2009).

              | high velocity at the support surface during pyrolysis (Li et al. 1993). The metallic
              | solution arrives at the substrate at a temperature close to the melting point (Quicker et

title         | 2.8.3 Rolling
blank         | 
text          | The cold rolling process starts with homogenization of the desired metal, e.g., pure Pd
              | or a Pd-based alloy into a thick foil or sheet. This foil is then placed in a mill, which
              | has two rollers that the foil fits between and it is cold rolled to the desired thickness.
              | Using this method Tosti et al. obtained a thickness of 75 µm for a pure Pd foil and 50
              | µm for a Pd-Ag foil (Tosti et al. 2000). Afterwards, the foil was crimped to create a
              | seam for welding to take place and thus created a tubular-like dense membrane.

title         | 2.8.4 Physical Vapor Deposition
blank         | 
text          | The physical vapor deposition method, PVD, is the evaporation of a metal, which can
              | take place via resistive heating, followed by its condensation on a desired surface. The
              | entire process needs to be completed in a clean vacuum chamber with a pure metallic
              | target (Mattox 2010). Although the cost of operation is relativity high, (Buxbaum et al.
              | 1996) PVD is a versatile method for manufacturing hydrogen permeable membranes
              | (Reichelt et al. 1990). Its flexibility allows for room temperature operation, which is

blank         | 
text          | Megnetron sputtering is an approach that consists of a vacuum chamber with a target
              | and a substrate. The target is the material to be deposited, i.e., palladium, while the
              | substrate is the supporting material of the membrane. A plasma beam induced by an
              | inert gas, argon, dislodges atoms and ions from the target by momentum exchange and
              | the species are deposited on the substrate to the desired thickness thereby creating the
              | membrane (Thomann et al. 2000). The use of permanent magnets confines the plasma
              | to the specific area of the target to ensure maximum ionization (Marshall III 1994).

text          | The electron beam evaporation process takes place in a high vacuum chamber with

              | several materials within the chamber at the same time for ease of switching between
              | them (Harsha 2005). Changing the position of where the electron beam is oriented can
              | create the highly desired alloy, that is otherwise very difficult to fabricate (George
              | 1992).

text          | During the PVD process, an inert or reactive gas can be oriented at the target material
              | to influence the properties, thereby creating increased control on the membrane
              | fabrication process. The positive ion bombardment increases the average energy of the
              | surface atoms thereby increasing their mobility and potentially leading to better

title         | 2.8.5 Electroplating
blank         | 
text          | The electroplating (EP) process takes place in a solution where the desired metallic
              | precursors are dissolved (or complexed). The support material is placed in solution
              | and used as the cathode while electrons are supplied via a power source. At a fixed
              | temperature, the thickness of the metallic layer, ranging from a few micrometers up to
              | millimeters, can be controlled based on current density and electroplating time (Wise
              | 1968). A variation of this process is pulsed electroplating, which allows for variability
              | of the applied current by pulsing, thereby leading to improved control of the metallic
              | growth properties, which include stress, composition, and grain size (Natter et al.
              | 1997, Bryden et al. 1998). One drawback of electroplating is the narrow range of the
              | plating solution’s composition, i.e. various wt.% of different alloys to be deposited
              | (Mohler 1969).

title         | 2.8.6 Electroless Plating
blank         | 
text          | Electroless plating (ELP) is a controlled autocatalytic process where the target is
              | placed in a suspended bath of metallic salt complexes that become reduced by way of
              | a reducing agent on the target surface. The meta-stable metallic complexes have the
              | desired membrane metal, in this case palladium, which will be chemically deposited
              | on the target (Shu et al. 1993). This simplistic process using minimal equipment, is
              | low on cost and has easy procedures for accomplishing fabrication (Mallory et al.

text          | 1990). Furthermore, the substrate material doesn’t need to be conductive like the EP
              | process and is not geometrically limited. Potential drawbacks of this process are the
              | inability to deposit an alloy on the target substrate. In order to obtain an alloy, the
              | target must have each metal deposited separately one after the other and than annealed
              | at high temperatures to ensure alloying (Belser 1960, Uemiya et al. 1991, Uemiya et
              | al. 1991).
              | The ELP process was used to make most of the Pd-based composite membranes
              | throughout this work. The finer details of the ELP process including the surface
              | activation steps, chemical bath and formula for achieving thin Pd-film composite

text          | Research related to incorporating membranes, mainly Pd and Pd-alloys, into a catalyst
              | bed for producing hydrogen from SMR reactions has taken place for decades. Initial
              | research using Pd-based membranes took place using dense pure palladium
              | membranes with a thickness of > 100 µm, but given the low hydrogen flux, reaction
              | temperatures needed to be greater than 700 °C to achieve realistic methane conversion
              | (Oertel et al. 1987). Improvements to MR technology took place by using thinner
              | supported membranes, thus providing higher hydrogen flux; improving the methane
              | conversion to 90% at temperatures as low as 500 °C (Uemiya et al. 1988, Uemiya et
              | al. 1990). Further studies concluded that by increasing the permeate sweep gas and/or
              | the steam-to-carbon ratio the conversion of methane increased (Shu et al. 1994). Using
              | a sweep gas for the promotion of hydrogen flux through the membrane, i.e. decreasing
              | the partial pressure of hydrogen, has been largely studied as a way to fully realize the

              | hydrogen flux, while providing pure hydrogen as steam is easily condensable
              | (Gallucci et al. 2004). (Tong et al. 2005) showed that the use of a palladium
              | membrane supported with porous stainless steel was able to achieve a methane
              | conversion of ~ 97% and a ~ 91% recovery of hydrogen (defined by the collected
              | hydrogen from the permeate side, i.e. pure hydrogen, divided by the total hydrogen
              | produced from the reaction). Several studies have shown that the use of a Pd-based
              | MR can reach high methane conversions while operating at lower temperatures than
              | FBRs. (Chen et al. 2008) confirmed that the removal of hydrogen from the reaction
              | zone using Pd-based membranes allowed for higher methane conversion than a FBR at
              | the same operational conditions. More specifically, (Lin et al. 2003) showed that a Pd
              | MR was able to obtain a methane conversion of 70% at 500 °C whereas, a FBR would
              | have to operate at 850 °C to obtain the same conversion. Several other authors using
              | various supporting materials, i.e. PSS, ceramic, etc., for the Pd-based composite MR
              | obtained enhanced conversion at low operational temperatures and pressures
              | (Iulianelli et al. 2010, Basile et al. 2011, Sarić et al. 2012). The lifetime of the Pd-
              | based membranes when being used during the SMR reaction is another important
              | parameter with (Dittmar et al. 2013) concluding that at 650 °C, the performance of the
              | system did not change over the period of study, > 350 hours. Further information
              | regarding steam methane conversion reaction testing obtained in this work can be

text          | Although the focus of this research was on the SMR reaction to produce hydrogen,
              | other fossil fuel feeds can also be used under various temperature and pressure
              | conditions to achieve a pure stream of H2. As previously discussed, the ability of the
              | MR to selectivity permeate H2 allows for the thermodynamic constraints of a FBR to
              | be overcome. This unique ability of the MR technology has allowed for its application
              | to many different fossil fuel dehydrogenation reactions. A detailed summary of these
              | reactions along with their operating conditions, dominant chemical reaction pathways,
              | and membrane type are listed in Table 2.4. Also evident in this table is the increased
              | conversion achieved in MRs over FBRs with the best performance, conversion, and
              | yield coming from the Pd-based MRs as compared to other inorganic membranes.
              | More specifically at an operational temperature of 500 °C and by using a Pd-based
              | composite membrane, (Uemiya et al. 1991) obtained a dehydrogenation of propane
              | conversion of 95%, while (Collins et al. 1996) obtained a propane conversion of 97%.
              | Table 2.4 also shows that greater than 90% conversion can be obtained when applying
              | Pd-based MR technology to the WGS, steam reforming of methanol, glycerol,
              | methane, and ethanol reactions, while working at temperatures below their respective

              | pressure is varied (Etherington et al. 1955, Brooks 1959). The PSA process typically
              | takes place in a cyclic process with four stages. The feed enters the sorbent bed at a
              | high pressure, i.e., > 15 bar, and the undesired gases adsorb onto the adsorbent with
              | the desired product left within the void space. Commonly used sorbents include
              | activated carbon, silica gel, alumina and zeolites (Malek et al. 1998, Yong et al. 2000,
              | Lopes et al. 2009). Next, the bed is depressurized and purged with the pure product
              | gas to vacate the bed space for the final step of repressurization (Ruthven et al. 1994).
              | This batch process is completed in a matter of minutes with a network of valves to
              | switch gases into their relevant stages. This conventional four-step process has been
              | modified over the years to allow for higher throughput, e.g., 100,000 m3/h, with a 12-
              | bed system deployed by UOP, but the fundamental principles are the same (Sircar et
              | al. 2000). In the early 2000s, a more compact technology, i.e., fast-cycle PSA, became

text          | commercially viable. This system takes the traditional PSA unit and adds the benefit
              | of a much smaller footprint, fewer moving parts and lower cost; mostly because of the
              | use of a rotary valves (Toreja et al. 2011). With this fast-cycle PSA, hydrogen at a
              | flow rate of ~100 m3/h can be purified in 20% the space and at 50% less cost than
              | conventional PSA units (Alizadeh-Khiavi et al. 2010). Furthermore, PSA technology
              | allows for a variation in H2 purity making it tunable for a wide range of industrial
              | processes (Barelli et al. 2008).

text          | Although its use for gas phase hydrogen purification is limited, another industrial
              | technology is cryogenic separation, which is typically used for the separation of
              | ambient air into its various species, i.e., N2, O2, Ar, etc. The feed stream enters a
              | pretreatment column that removes dust and then is compressed to a desired pressure
              | thereby removing excess water. Next, the gas enters a large distillation column where
              | it is cooled until the difference in the boiling point temperatures of each gas allows for
              | the complete removal of a particular species. Considering air separation as an
              | example, the boiling point of nitrogen, oxygen, argon and helium are approximately -
              | 196 °C, -183 °C, -186 °C and -269 °C (Haynes 2014), respectively. These temperature
              | differences allow for the separation of each gas to take place, hence the large vertical
              | distillation column often present at cryogenic facilities. Although this technology does
              | not allow for highly pure gas phase H2 to be produced, a purity of ~ 98% is achievable
              | and a potential advantage is the ability for the technology to operate at low
              | temperatures (Hinchliffe et al. 2000, Adhikari et al. 2006). A commercial use for
              | cryogenic technology is the production of liquid hydrogen to be used as a fuel source
              | for rockets (Bain 1990, Peschka et al. 1992).

text          | Not surprising, the industrial technologies, i.e., PSA and cryogenic, have very high
              | throughput and a long lifetime, while having high operating pressure and low
              | operating temperature. Dense polymer membranes suffer from low throughput, i.e.
              | small flux, and low selectivity; however, they operate at a relatively low temperature,
              | which may be beneficial for certain applications outside of the purification of high
              | temperature reforming gases, i.e. fuel cell applications (Bose et al. 2011).
              | Microporous/dense ceramic and porous carbon membranes have low hydrogen
              | selectivity and flux, while operating in a temperature range suitable for reforming.
              | However, they are either in the prototype or small-scale commercialization phases of
              | demonstration. Metallic membranes are subject to poisoning from various components
              | found within natural gas, i.e. sulfur containing species and with respect to current
              | commercial technologies they have a short product lifetime. However, since they are
              | only selective towards hydrogen and operate at temperatures suitable for reforming,
              | metallic membranes have the ability to be used at a large-scale for purification.
              | Although omitted from Table 2.6, the scale of pure hydrogen production is an
              | important parameter. For example, most of the membrane technologies are suitable for
              | smaller scale hydrogen purification (Sjardin et al. 2006), while the commercial
              | technologies are well suited for large-scale production. This is not to say membranes
              | do not have the ability to purify large-scale hydrogen and in the future become
              | commercially viable, but that above a given scale, conventional commercial
              | approaches are currently more economically feasible.

              | which has the potential to mitigate the environmental impact of hydrogen production

text          | Carbon capture has made its way into the headlines for decades now, without much
              | movement forward. The ideas that are technically viable have not been proven
              | economically feasible unless a carbon tax is implemented (Edenhofer et al. 2014).
              | Policies need to be set in place to ensure a sustainable direction to decarbonizing
              | world energy resources. This can be done by not only using carbon-free sources, but
              | also by mitigating the carbon emissions from fossil fuels. Hydrogen-producing MRs
              | are one potential avenue to alleviate carbon emissions. For example, the use of
              | membranes for onsite power generation could eliminate the need to flare methane at
              | oil-producing wells. Reforming this methane via a membrane would produce
              | hydrogen, for energy needs, and CO2, to be used on-site for enhanced oil recovery
              | (Kuuskraa 2011).

text          | Hydrogen-selective metallic membranes may also play an integral role in medium- to
              | long-term energy applications, especially if carbon capture is implemented. There
              | have been debates over just how clean hydrogen really is as an energy carrier, given
              | that more than 90% of global hydrogen production currently comes from fossil fuels
              | (Ockwig et al. 2007, Armaroli et al. 2011). Research on hydrogen production from
              | renewable resources such as biomass is well underway, (Holladay et al. 2009, Kırtay
              | 2011, Chaubey et al. 2013) yet equal attention should be paid to decarbonization of
              | conventional hydrogen purification approaches such as PSA (Adhikari et al. 2006,
              | Ockwig et al. 2007). The implementation of carbon capture will allow hydrogen to be
              | produced and purified with reduced CO2 emissions, even when fossil fuels are used.

              | and electric cars, (Tollefson 2010) steady R&D progress has been made by leading
              | international car and energy companies (Eberle et al. 2012). One of the remaining
              | challenges is the lack of a hydrogen fuel infrastructure (Eberle et al. 2012). In the
              | meantime, onsite natural gas reforming at refueling stations could be a viable near- to
              | medium-term solution, (Sjardin et al. 2006, Chu et al. 2012) especially when low-cost
              | natural gas is available as is currently the case in the U.S. (Chu et al. 2012). As an
              | example, Pd-based MRs may be considered for distributed (point-of-use) hydrogen
              | production on a small scale for the transportation sector, e.g., on the order of 2 to 4
              | MW, and made available at refueling stations integrated with the existing natural gas

text          | Another option would be on board hydrogen production for fuel cells. For this
              | application, high-purity hydrogen has to be produced within highly space-compact
              | devices, while traditional purification facilities would not be able to meet this
              | requirement due to their complexity and size (Lin et al. 2000). MRs would be
              | advantageous for on-board applications given their ability to produce high-purity
              | hydrogen within a small volume. In particular, the MR concept may potentially reduce
              | the reactor volume by a factor of 10 to 100 compared to conventional methane
              | reforming combined with the WGS reaction (Brunetti et al. 2011). Another benefit of
              | the MR is its high conversion efficiency at lower operating temperatures compared to
              | the conventional SMR process due to the selective removal of hydrogen.

text          | In 2004, the USDoE looked into funding future research related to onboard fuel
              | reforming and made a no-go decision. The investigation team believed that the
              | milestones could not be met in the timeframe allotted by the President, but with
              | sufficient time the technology was deemed promising. The original timeframe of 2030
              | was pushed up to 2015, thereby overpromising the onboard reforming technology.
              | Although the independent panel recommended a no-go decision, they also made a
              | number of specific recommendations that, if implemented, would effectively continue
              | the support of onboard fuel processing R&D (Energy 2004). In the work investigated
              | and considered by the USDoE, the technology was based upon onboard reforming
              | with a decoupled separation process. That is, the hydrogen was produced by a catalytic
              | reaction and the hydrogen was separated afterwards. This differs from the proposed
              | technology in this work, i.e. since the addition of a Pd-based membrane will be
              | directly in the catalyst bed. This addition of the Pd-based membranes allows for higher
              | feed conversions due to the continuous removal of hydrogen from the reaction zone
              | thereby driving the SMR reaction to higher conversions at lower operating

text          | For smaller and emerging hydrogen markets such as the semiconductor and fuel cell
              | industries, the use of Pd-based membranes is appropriate due to the moderate scales in
              | addition to their purity requirements. First, these applications are small- to medium-
              | scale with capacities ranging from 5 to 1,000 m3/h, (Rostrup-Nielsen 2005) which is
              | more than 100 times smaller than large-scale applications such as refining and
              | ammonia production. The inherent compactness of membrane units would enable on-

text          | small-scale users can source hydrogen from large-scale plants at a reasonable
              | production cost, (Rostrup-Nielsen 2005) but the high cost of distribution would make
              | this option less attractive. The distribution cost of hydrogen is 15 times higher than
              | that of liquid hydrocarbon fuels on a mass basis primarily due to higher compression
              | costs (Lattin et al. 2007). If carbon capture and storage (CCS) were considered, CO2
              | distribution to sequestration sites would contribute to the cost of small-scale
              | production units. In this case, Sjardin et al. concluded from a techno-economic study
              | that at a hydrogen production scale below 40 MW (i.e., ~12,300 m3/h; HHV of H2 and
              | molar volume at 298 K), membrane reactors with CCS ($19/GJ) would become
              | competitive with centralized H2 production ($18/GJ) (Sjardin et al. 2006). On-site
              | hydrogen production would also provide a self-sufficient supply and circumvent
              | delivery delays as well as issues with storage safety. Nevertheless, higher production
              | costs due to smaller product sizes and safety concerns over local production and
              | handling of hydrogen as an explosive gas should be taken into consideration (Armaroli
              | et al. 2011). Secondly, fuel cell and semiconductor applications require hydrogen of
              | very high purities. In semiconductor manufacturing, hydrogen is used as a carrier gas
              | for trace doping elements, (Philpott 1985, Häussinger et al. 2012) and hydrogen of
              | near absolute purity is needed (Philpott 1985, Ockwig et al. 2007). For proton
              | exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), CO impurities in the hydrogen feed could
              | strongly adsorb onto the catalyst, leading to catalyst deactivation and cell performance
              | deterioration (Majlan et al. 2009, Sharma 2009, Mendes et al. 2010). A CO
              | concentration as low as 2 ppm has been recommended by the USDoE for hydrogen
              | used in on-board vehicle fuel cells, (Mendes et al. 2010) which corresponds to a
              | hydrogen purity of 99.999+%. Such high purities are readily available from Pd-based
              | membranes, which have a theoretical infinite selectivity towards hydrogen (Sjardin et
              | al. 2006, Lu et al. 2007, Mendes et al. 2010) as outlined previously in this chapter.

              | al. 2004, Weili et al. 2013). When used as a fuel for electricity generation, hydrogen
              | can be produced from natural gas via SMR, or from coal, or biomass gasification. A
              | typical fuel gas consists mainly of H2, CO2, CO, and other impurities. CO2 separation

              | capture.

text          | When used as a fuel gas, high-pressure hydrogen (Ku et al. 2011) of less than 80%
              | purity (Ockwig et al. 2007, NETL 2009) is favored for use in conventional gas
              | turbines. This hydrogen purity is necessary for maintaining a moderate flame
              | temperature (Chiesa et al. 2007, Merkel et al. 2012) to suppress NOx formation in the
              | combustion chamber, (Damen et al. 2006, Chiesa et al. 2007, Merkel et al. 2012) as
              | current NOx reduction technology in gas turbines cannot be used for hydrogen
              | combustion (Damen et al. 2006). If pre-combustion CO2 capture is considered for
              | H2/CO2 separation, membrane technology can be employed. In this case, a nitrogen or
              | steam sweep gas can be used to increase the separation driving force by decreasing the
              | permeate-side hydrogen partial pressure (Damen et al. 2006, Chiesa et al. 2007, Ku et
              | al. 2011) and to reduce the required membrane surface area (Chiesa et al. 2007). The
              | sweep gas will also act as a diluent to control the flame temperature and reduce NOx
              | levels (Chiesa et al. 2007, Merkel et al. 2012) as previously discussed. Since high
              | purity is not a requirement for power generation, highly selective Pd-based
              | membranes would lose their advantage compared to other membrane materials. For
              | example, it has been estimated that a H2/CO2 selectivity ranging from 20 to 60 and a
              | H2/N2 selectivity from 130 to 870 would be sufficient for IGCC plants (Ku et al.
              | 2011). The more stringent H2/N2 selectivity is needed to prevent back-diffusion of N2
              | into the CO2-rich stream to meet the specifications for CO2 pipeline transport and
              | sequestration, but can be loosened depending on the downstream cleanup operations
              | (Ku et al. 2011). These selectivity requirements allow for a wider range of materials to
              | be used, such as ceramic and polymeric membranes (Ku et al. 2011).

text          | Although the high operating temperature of Pd-based membranes, e.g., 300 to 600 °C,
              | (Adhikari et al. 2006) is compatible with power plant applications, the high
              | temperature range is not unique to metallic membranes. For example, an operating

              | polymeric hydrogen-selective membranes (Figueroa et al. 2008). A common

              | plant using a Selexol separation process, as the former consumes more power for CO2

              | and the investment cost of the membrane system is 1.6% lower than the Selexol
              | system. The results of these techno-economic studies are subject to the assumptions on
              | separation efficiencies, capital and operating costs, and even regulations on CO2
              | capture, and therefore should be interpreted and compared with caution. Lab- and

text          | In addition to electricity, hydrogen can be co-produced from coal- or natural gas–
              | based processes. PSA can be integrated with the shift reactor for bulk hydrogen
              | recovery in the range of 50% to 80% (NETL 2009) and for high-purity hydrogen
              | production, (Damen et al. 2006) and this concept would be similar to the large-scale
              | hydrogen production method conventionally employed. Techno-economic studies
              | have shown that, similar to the case of electricity production from an IGCC plant, Pd-
              | based membranes may only offer modest efficiency improvements and cost savings
              | compared to PSA or physical absorption. For example, Kreutz et al. assessed hydrogen
              | production from coal gasification with Pd60Cu40 membranes and used Selexol for CO2
              | capture with PSA for hydrogen purification and found that the former case offers a
              | less than 1% reduction in capital costs, but a 2% increase in the hydrogen production
              | cost (Kreutz et al. 2002).

text          | In theory, metallic membranes for hydrogen production have a place within large-

text          | The evaluation of experimental data relies on the calibration of the analysis equipment
              | to be used. Without calibration the results can become unreliable. therefore, very
              | careful calibration took place before starting each experimental campaign. This
              | chapter shows the detailed approach used for the careful instrument calibration as well
              | as each experimental system used for the various reaction testing.

text          | The most important tool used for the testing analysis was the mass spectrometer (MS)
              | Extrel model MAX300-LG. This instrument has the ability to identify mass ranges
              | from 1-250 atomic mass units (amu) detecting up to 10 parts per billion (ppb) of each
              | component. This accurate instrument needs to be carefully calibrated to ensure the
              | consistency of the data. Extrel provides an internal calibration method that is
              | remarkably accurate, which may be suitable for some applications, e.g., trend spotting
              | or relative differences. However, for the experimental work carried out in this study,
              | an external calibration was used for maximizing accuracy, which involved various gas
              | compositions within the expected range of reaction testing.

text          | The steps for calibration are as follows: a standard gas of argon at a fixed flow rate
              | was used to supply the MS with a constant feed throughout all calibration tests and
              | experimental data obtained. Various compositions of the four gases present during the
              | reaction testing, i.e., H2, CH4, CO, and CO2, were fed into the MS. The ratio of each
              | gas flow rate and argon versus the ratio of their MS intensity was plotted to obtain a
              | linear relationship. The value of the slope, known as the response factor (RF), was

text          | Precise flow measurements are essential for experimental testing and are the basis for
              | setting parameters such as, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), feed conversion, and
              | checking the performance of the reaction via a carbon balance. Aalborg mass flow
              | controllers (e.g., GFC17) and a mass flow meter (e.g., GFM17A) were used for this
              | purpose. The mass flow controllers (MFC) provided a steady flow of pure gases
              | whereas the mass flow meter (MFM) was placed at the exit of the analysis system to
              | check the total flow rate. Each Aalborg MFC is designed for a specific gas and the
              | precision between the set point and the released gas is +/- 1%. However, it was found
              | that the deviation from the set point value was too great for the experimental tolerance
              | and thus external calibration was completed. In this case the calibration is a
              | comparison between the set point and the flow rate measured. Through this
              | comparison a plot can be drawn and a relationship between the flow rate measured
              | (average of 10 points) and the set point can be established. As an example, the
              | calibration for the CO2 mass flow controller is reported in Figure 3.2.

text          | The FBR system was placed inside a high-temperature tube furnace (Carbolite STF)
              | and heated to an operating temperature under ~ 1 °C/min. Although the oven had a

              | monitored via a set of k-type thermocouples (Omega Engineering) positioned at
              | different critical points along the experimental setup as within the FBR, junction

text          | Details of the experimental setup are as follows: pure gases were regulated and
              | supplied to the FBR via Aalborg GFC17 thermal MFCs; distilled water was supplied
              | through an Eldex 1 LMP pump, which was vaporized and mixed with gases prior to
              | entering the FBR, a temperature-regulated bath (Julabo F25-EH) was used to condense
              | water vapor from the product stream, and an Extrel Max-300LG MS was used for
              | analyzing the composition of dry gas species. A commercial Ni-based SMR catalyst
              | supplied by Johnson Matthey Inc. was used. Before packing 3 g of catalyst into a fixed
              | bed, it was crushed and sieved to a nominal particle size of ~ 300 µm, in order to
              | increase the available surface area for the SMR reaction and to avoid pressure drop
              | across the catalytic bed. A photograph of the setup used in this work is shown in

text          | The operating conditions used for FBR1 were varied as follows: a steam-to-carbon
              | ratio, i.e., S/C of 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5, with a reaction pressure of 1.0 bar – 7.9 bar, and a
              | reaction temperature between 350 to 600 °C. The GHSV = 2,600 h-1 was kept constant
              | throughout all of the FBR1 experimental tests. The low working temperature of the
              | FBR was for the purpose of being used as a comparative study for the MR tests to
              | follow, which operate at temperatures below 500 °C.

text          | With the intent to simulate an industrial process for hydrogen production in which the
              | reformer is followed by Water Gas Shift (WGS) reactors, a second reactor was placed
              | after FBR1, which was used to carry out the WGS reaction at high temperature. The
              | addition of this HT-WGS catalyst bed should promote the mitigation of CO while
              | producing more hydrogen. The high temperature (HT) WGS that follows the SMR bed
              | was able to use the higher temperature outlet gas of the methane reformer to enhance
              | the kinetics of the reaction. Although the WGS reaction is exothermic in nature, it is
              | kinetically limited below ~200 °C. A comprehensive review of the WGS reactions can
              | be found in the literature review Chapter 1, Section 2.1.1. The HT-WGS reactor was
              | packed with 1.5 grams of iron-chrome-based catalyst, crushed and sieved to a nominal
              | particle size of ~ 300 µm. The catalyst was commercially available and supplied by

text          | As a final part of the experimental campaign, another FBR was located after the HT-

              | used for the WGS reaction at low temperature (LT). The LT-WGS catalyst supplied
              | by Johnson Matthey Inc. was crushed to a particle size of ~ 300 µm and 1.0 gram of a
              | Cu-based catalyst was packed in the bed. FBR3 was operated to enhance the

text          | The experimental setup used for the reaction testing with membrane Ma-173 and DR1
              | differed from the initial testing completed on membrane PdF1 and Ma-2. The major
              | differences were by using a different heating configuration, i.e., heating tape was used
              | in place of the tube furnace as well as a different membrane configuration, i.e., a free-
              | standing membrane compared to both sides being secured within the MR. A 3-D

              | membrane was 350 to 500 °C. The MR system was heated up by heating tape at a rate
              | of ~ 1 °C/min, controlled by a voltage control (Glas-Col PowrTwin) and the

              | membrane, AlO2, was personally fabricated in Professor Ma’s lab in the Center for
              | Inorganic Membrane Studies at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The membrane is
              | characterized by having a Pd layer ~ 13 µm thick with a total active surface area of ~
              | 23 cm2. The deposition of the Pd layer took place via electroless plating on a ceramic

text          | Further details of the experimental set up as shown in Figure 3.13 are as follows. The
              | MR consisted of a tubular stainless steel module (length 120 mm and inner diameter
              | of 15 mm) housing the Pd ceramic membrane. Graphite O-rings (99.5% C and 0.5%
              | S), supplied by Gee Graphite Ltd., are placed at both membrane ends to prevent the
              | possibility of the permeate and retentate streams mixing with each other. Pure gas
              | flow was supplied to the MR by means of different MFCs (Brooks Instruments
              | 5850S), driven by computer software supplied by Lira (Italy). Distilled water was
              | supplied by a P680 HPLC volumetric pump (Dionex), which was vaporized before
              | mixing with methane. Afterwards, the mixture of methane and steam was fed to a
              | preheating zone and then into the reaction side. A nitrogen stream was used as an
              | internal standard gas for the gas chromatography (GC) for complicating the data, and
              | as sweep gas in the permeate side.

text          | One possible way to provide a constant supply of natural gas to the membrane reactor
              | is through a separate storage unit on-board the vehicle. This would take up additional
              | space on-board with the highest density of natural gas being in the form of liquefied
              | natural gas (LNG), which has the lower feasible spatial limit and takes up 1/600th less
              | volume than NG at STP. However, LNG requires a large amount of energy to
              | condense into a liquid phase (-161 °C) and specially designed cryogenic storage
              | vessels to ensure adequate transport. In order to avoid additional equipment on-board
              | the vehicle, the catalyst used for the reaction could also double as a NG storage
              | location. If the physical properties of the material, i.e., if the catalyst properties are
              | optimal for gas sorption, then the adsorbed density of that gas may be increased
              | relative to the non-adsorbed phase (Wood et al. 2008, Dawson et al. 2012); therefore,
              | natural gas absorbed within a material, i.e., catalyst, can have a higher density
              | compared to natural gas at STP, with the possibility of having densities higher than
              | compressed natural gas (CNG) (Kitagawa et al. 2004, Thornton et al. 2009, Ma et al.
              | 2011). This translates to a smaller on-board MR system with possible synergies in
              | terms of efficient packaging and subsequently lowering the associative heating and
              | energy consumption.

text          | Significant work has been completed in the area of methane storage with several
              | recent review papers showing materials that have high methane storage capacities
              | (Menon et al. 1998, Eddaoudi et al. 2002, Konstas et al. 2012, Makal et al. 2012,
              | Yusof et al. 2012, Li et al. 2013). Interest in this type of research has grown over the
              | past decades with the DOE having an energy density target of physically adsorbed
              | methane at 3.5 MPa compared to CNG at 24.8 MPa (Burchell et al. 2000). This

              | v/v at standard conditions (298K and 1 bar) (Bhatia et al. 2006). This compares to
              | CNG that has a 245 v/v using a density of 0.175 kg/liter and for completeness, LNG
              | takes up 1/600th less volume than NG (600 v/v; density of 0.45 kg/liter). Furthermore,
              | in order for the adsorbed methane to be used as an on-board fuel, the optimal heat of
              | adsorption at 254 K has been estimated to be 18.8 kJ/mol (Bhatia et al. 2006). This
              | value is strong enough to store large amounts of methane at 30 bar, but weak enough
              | to allow for the release of methane at a discharge pressure of 1.5 bar. The authors also
              | note that most materials that are tested in the literature do not take into account the
              | desorption of methane (or hydrogen), but only the adsorption capacity, which is likely
              | insignificant if the adsorbed gas is not reversible under reasonable discharge
              | conditions. Most studies in the literature show the adsorption capacity of other gases,
              | i.e., hydrogen, as well as methane. DOE also has storage targets for H2 (5.5 wt.%), but
              | unlike CH4 these have not been met although many materials show great promise
              | (Satyapal et al. 2007, O’Malley et al. 2015, Ramesh et al. 2015).

              | 
text          | Some promising materials for CH4 adsorption are metal organic frameworks, MOFs,
              | covalent organic polymers (COFs), single-walled carbon nanotubes, and zeolites. Two
              | leading MOFs in terms of CH4 storage capacity are PPN-14 with a 230 v/v (188 mg/g)
              | methane-adsorption capacity at 290 K and 35 bar (Ma et al. 2008) as well as PPN-4
              | with a methane capacity of 273 mg/g at 295 K and 35 bar (Yuan et al. 2011). The
              | authors of the PPN-4 material indicate that the density of the material is not known
              | and therefore v/v information is not available. Similarly, three different COFs have
              | achieved a methane storage capacity of 195 v/v, COF-1 (298 K and 30 bar), 114 v/v,
              | COF-2, and 106 v/v, COF-3, both at 35 bar and 290 K as well as all three achieving
              | >200 v/v at 150 bar (Furukawa et al. 2009). Further simulation results show that COF-
              | 102 would be able to obtain 230 v/v at 5 bar and 298 K (Zhu et al. 2015). While these
              | are promising storage capacities, they would unlikely be able to meet the other DOE
              | methane storage targets of efficient charge/discharge rate, high hydrophobicity, and

              | pressure of 150 bar for the COF would take a significant amount of energy thus
              | making it not feasible for MR applications. Additionally, another methane storage
              | material, a single-walled carbon nanostructured material, has achieved a methane
              | storage capacity of 160 v/v at 35 bar, exceeding the DOE target of 150 v/v (Murata et
              | al. 2004).

text          | Zeolites are another important material because of their current applications as a
              | catalyst and more specifically the possible use as a SMR reaction catalyst (Al-Ubaid et
              | al. 1988). In fact, the research relating to adsorbed natural gas began with zeolite
              | testing back in the 1970s (Munson et al. 1971, Munson 1973). Theoretical methane
              | storage capacities for zeolites have been estimated to be >120 v/v (Goodbody et al.
              | 1991, Cracknell et al. 1992, Smit 1995) and many experimental values are between 30
              | – 65 v/v (Rolniak et al. 1980, Otto 1981, Abdul-Rehman et al. 1990, Mentasty et al.
              | 1991, Zhang et al. 1991, Talu et al. 1993). The heat of adsorption for zeolites are
              | within 12.9 – 19.2 kJ/mol, which is around the calculated optimal of 18.8 kJ/mol as
              | shown earlier (Choudhary et al. 1993, Dunne et al. 1996, Ohlin et al. 2013). One
              | downside to using zeolites is there ability to preferentially adsorb moisture, which
              | could have a significant impact on the long-term adsorption/desorption cycle of
              | methane (Shah et al. 2000, McDonnell et al. 2005, Fasano et al. 2016). Nonetheless,
              | there have been direct mobile applications using zeolites as a methane storage media
              | with two patents filed to date (Stockmeyer 1985, Chang 1994, Dolan et al. 2014).

text          | Comparatively, R110 shows the largest pore size and the tightest packing of pores.
              | W210 has the smallest pores and what appears to be an extensive pore network.
              | Furthermore, W220 has a similar pore size and network to that of W210. This is in
              | good agreement with how the fabrication of SMR and WGS catalysts impact the end
              | use product (Sehested 2006). When a catalyst is used for high temperature
              | applications, i.e., SMR, low surface area supporting material provides high mechanical
              | strength and limits sintering (Nieva et al. 2014). Furthermore, when the application is
              | for lower temperature applications, i.e., WGS, the high surface area supports can be
              | used because sintering is less of an issue (Smith et al. 2010).
              | The following sections show a quantitative analysis of the catalysts.

text          | The equipment used for gas sorption data was an Autosorb iQ2, which operates by
              | measuring the quantity of gas adsorbed onto or desorbed from a solid surface at some
              | equilibrium vapor pressure by the static volumetric method. The data are obtained by
              | admitting or removing a known quantity of adsorptive gas into or out of a sample cell
              | containing the solid adsorbent maintained at a constant temperature below the critical
              | temperature of the adsorbate. As adsorption or desorption occurs the pressure in the
              | sample cell changes until equilibrium is established. The quantity of gas adsorbed or
              | desorbed at the equilibrium pressure is the difference between the amount of gas
              | admitted or removed and the amount required to fill the space surrounding the
              | adsorbent (void space).

              | 
text          | The Autosorb iQ2 has the capability of measuring adsorbed or desorbed volumes of
              | nitrogen (77 K), argon (87 K) and carbon dioxide (273 - 313 K) at relative pressures in
              | the range of 0.001 to slightly less than 1.0. This volume-pressure data can be reduced
              | by the Autosorb iQ2 software into BET surface area (single and/or multipoint),
              | Langmuir surface area, adsorption and/or desorption isotherms, pore size and surface
              | area distributions, micropore volume and surface area using an extensive set of built-in
              | data reduction procedures.

text          | The samples were first degassed under vacuum for 10 hours at 623 K to ensure that
              | any gas within the pore spaces was vacated. After, the samples were placed at 77K
              | (liquid nitrogen) and nitrogen was injected until the pressure becomes stable, at which
              | point the pressure is increased further. With the temperature of the sample cell at the
              | boiling point of the gas that is being injected, i.e., nitrogen, relative pressures are
              | easily achieved. The first results to evaluate are the adsorption and desorption
              | isotherms. Figure 4.4 shows adsorption and desorption isotherm data for the SMR
              | catalyst, R110.

text          | For R110 the adsorption of nitrogen peaks at 52 cm3/gram and the desorption curve
              | closely relates. The y-axis units indicate the amount of gas, i.e., nitrogen that is
              | adsorbed/desorbed within one gram of catalyst. The gap between the sorption curves
              | indicates that some gas is left within the pore spaces of the catalyst and is unable to
              | escape. This trapped gas means that if this catalyst was cycled between adsorption and
              | desorption, the amount of adsorbed gas would be lower the second time. Figure 4.5
              | and Figure 4.6 show the adsorption and desorption isotherm results for the WGS
              | catalysts, W210 and W220.

text          | The y-axis is the change in volume at each pore size; hence, the larger the change in
              | volume, the larger the number of pores at the given diameter. The PSD was obtained
              | by using a Non-Local Density Functional Theory (NLDFT) adsorption branch model
              | under the assumption that the pores are mostly cylindrical. The theory on the DFT
              | model used is explained well in in the following sources (Neimark et al. 2009, Lowell
              | et al. 2012, Silvestre-Albero et al. 2012). Relating back to the results obtained, the
              | W210 has a significant amount of smaller pores on the order of ~ 5nm, with W220
              | peaking within the 5 – 15 nm range and R110 being mostly flat across most pore sizes.
              | This shows that the catalysts studied are mostly mesoporous with a significant amount
              | of the adsorbed gas volume being held within the smaller pores. To ensure the
              | repeatability of the PSD data, sample R110 was conducted three times with three
              | different sample weights. It was initially thought that weight of the sample would have
              | an effect on the outcome of the PSD results. Figure 4.8 shows the R110 PSD data
              | collected for three different sample weights ranging between 0.0553 g – 1.503 g.

text          | This repeatability using different weighted samples indicates that using a smaller
              | sample size produces the same outcome. The smaller sample size saves analytical time
              | as well as the amount of sample needed for testing. All of these previous tests used
              | nitrogen for gaining information about PSD, which could have its limitations relating
              | to the mobility of N2 within the pore network of the catalyst. Upon consulting with
              | Quantachrome, the company that makes the Autosorb iQ2 being used, it was
              | suggested to try argon under a temperature of 87 K, i.e., boiling point of Ar. This
              | should produce similar data to using nitrogen, but have higher accuracy relating to
              | PSD and BET. Therefore, tests were repeated using all catalysts for better knowledge
              | of the smaller pore networks. For comparative purposes, only results concerning
              | W210 are presented here. Figure 4.9 shows data obtained for W210 relating to pore
              | sizes less than 10 nm. Within the graph, the naming convention for the samples is

              | Ar shows a steady increase in pore volume where as N2 shows a sharp increase around
              | 3nm and levels at 4nm. This difference can be attributed to the molecular size of each
              | gas, which allows Ar to enter the smaller pore spaces gradually whereas N2 builds up
              | and enters all at once around 3nm. Furthermore, both nitrogen and argon DFT models
              | break down below 2 nm and therefore the data gained below 1 nm is an artifact and
              | should not be considered. For data relating to the microporous pore volume below 1.5
              | nm the carbon dioxide DFT models should be used. Figure 4.10 shows the total pore
              | diameter range up to 50 nm, which is the highest pore diameter that can be used for

              | a sample surface. Throughout all DFT model tests presented earlier, the BET surface

text          | While the previous sections gathered data on the ability of the catalyst to be used as a
              | methane storage material, this section examines the composition of the SMR catalyst,
              | R110, before and after SMR reaction testing as well as after catalyst activation. Data
              | has been obtained related to carbon formation, sintering, and poisoning of the SMR
              | Ni-based catalyst. Two different reaction tests were carried out, the first was under
              | industrial operating conditions of an FBR with a reaction temperature of 1073 K and
              | reaction pressure up to 790 kPa, and the second reaction test was with a Pd-based MR,
              | with a reaction temperature of 400 °C and pressure up to 300 kPa. Furthermore,
              | testing was conducted after activation of the catalyst at two different temperatures, i.e.,
              | at the manufacturer recommended activation temperature of 600 °C for the FBR tests
              | and at 400 °C for the MR. Therefore, results could be obtained for the catalyst at its
              | initial state, just after activation, and after high temperature reaction testing, as well as
              | low temperature reaction testing. The catalyst was crushed and sieved to a size of 200
              | – 400 µm before all testing to ensure uniformity.

text          | The results were obtained using a PHI VersaProbe II Scanning X-ray photoelectron

              | 0.1% bulk with measurable sample surface depths of 10 – 50 angstroms (Å). The first
              | data obtained for R110 was related to the compositional analysis on the surface of the
              | catalyst. Figure 4.12 shows the intensity versus binding energy of the R110 for both

text          | Knowing roughly the composition of the catalyst before starting the testing made
              | identification of the elemental peaks simpler. The magnitude of the peaks changed
              | slightly for Ni, but was thought to be related to the crushed sample, which is not
              | uniform relating to the amount of Ni in one given sample area. The oxygen, O, peak is
              | related to both the Ni, which is deposited in the form NiO and supporting material of

text          | Results from these tests showed minimal carbon formation, which was to be expected
              | for an industrial-grade catalyst, which is developed to withstand higher temperatures
              | and to perform over longer time scales. The catalyst was crushed for operation in all
              | tests and it was unclear if exposing the catalyst support would change the time scale of
              | the activation of the catalyst. Also, since the XPS yields relative data, the ratios were
              | calculated for Al:Ni and Ca:Ni to realize if the catalyst composition varied. Regardless
              | of the high temperature or low temperature exposure, both Al:Ni and Ca:Ni ratios
              | remained constant.

text          | The aim of this chapter was to be informational and subsequently build a foundation
              | on which future catalyst development can take place that will lead to it acting as both a
              | catalyst and methane storage unit. The valuable data obtained indicates that a catalyst
              | could have optimal properties such that the sorption of methane is high, creating a
              | high relative density, and yet still providing the active sites for the SMR reaction to
              | take place. Further work needs to be conducted to see if a material like a MOF, which
              | has high methane storage capacity, could also double as a catalyst. Cycle time of
              | adsorption and desorption should also be tested. If significant, the MR system could
              | be slow filled overnight similar to some CNG truck fleets currently. Optimization by
              | way of material properties could be several PhDs worth of material and thus was only
              | briefly touched upon during this work. The overall outcome of this chapter shows that
              | a small MR footprint is achievable by using the catalyst as both a catalyst and methane
              | storage vessel.

text          | A significant amount of literature exists relating to the performance of SMR reaction
              | tests, which has led the way for optimized commercial applications for the production
              | of hydrogen. These commercial applications have been optimized relating to, but not
              | limited to: catalyst properties, reduced reformer duty load, efficient use of waste heat,
              | primary reformer metallurgy, and economics (Adris et al. 1996, Beyer et al. 2005,
              | Mueller-Langer et al. 2007, Simpson et al. 2007, Tugnoli et al. 2008, Garbiak et al.
              | 2011, Murzin 2013). Although previous studies have carried out SMR testing, FBR
              | experiments took place in the current work to ensure tight control on the working
              | parameters and repeatability of the results.

text          | This Chapter discusses the outcome of SMR and WGS reaction testing within three
              | different fixed bed reactors (FBR). The testing started by using a reactor (FBR1) in
              | which the SMR reaction was performed at different operating conditions. After which
              | a HT-WGS packed bed reactor was added, which is collectively referred to as FBR2
              | (SMR + HT-WGS). Following these tests a LT-WGS reactor was added, FBR3 (SMR
              | + HT-WGS + LT-WGS), to conclude the FBR testing.

text          | The SMR catalyst was a commercially available Ni-based catalyst and was packed
              | into a 5/8” (1.6 cm) stainless steel tube and placed within a tube furnace where
              | reaction testing was carried out across a variety of different parameters. These
              | included the influence of temperature, pressure, and steam-to-carbon ratio on the
              | performance of the SMR reaction, in terms of methane conversion, hydrogen
              | production and gas selectivity. These initial FBR tests allowed for a gathering of
              | information that would lead to the next set of experiments, which ultimately would be
              | used as a comparison for the MR testing to follow.

text          | The influence of temperature was carried out between 350 and 500 °C to allow for a
              | wide range of data that later could be used for comparison of the MR reaction testing.
              | This temperature range was chosen because of the upper limiting temperature of the
              | Pd/PSS composite membranes. Furthermore, the feed pressure was varied between 2.7
              | to 8 bar. Although the SMR reaction performance is negatively affected by an increase
              | in pressure due to the thermodynamics of the reaction (takes place due to the increase
              | in moles across the reaction), this data will be useful as a comparison with the MR
              | performance. Another important parameter that affects the performance of the SMR is
              | the steam-to-carbon molar ratio, i.e., S/C. Stoichiometrically, the SMR reaction has an
              | S/C ratio equal to 2/1; however, for this work it was chosen to operate with an excess
              | of steam to improve the reaction and reduce the possibility of coke formation
              | (Bartholomew 1982). In particular, the S/C ratio was varied between 2.5 and 3.5.

text          | As shown in Figure 5.4, the methane conversion decreases with increasing pressure as
              | well as decreasing temperature. The decreasing trend of the conversion with the
              | pressure is due to the thermodynamic limitation of the SMR reaction, which takes
              | place with an increasing mole number from the reactants to products.

text          | The influence of three different S/C ratios on the FBR1 performance were also
              | analyzed, particularly, the S/C ratios investigated were 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5. These S/C
              | ratios are based on the optimum range for mitigating carbon formation while
              | maximizing methane conversion (Rostrup-Nielsen 1984, Bartholomew et al. 2011).
              | The methane conversion as well as hydrogen selectivity versus reaction pressure at
              | different S/C can be seen in Figure 5.5.

              | The increase in hydrogen selectivity within the FBR was related to the enhanced

              | 2.1), an enhancement of the S/C ratio can shift the reaction towards the products.

text          | production can be improved by increasing the feed molar ratio. The ability for excess
              | steam to enhance conversion and hydrogen selectivity is evident in Figure 5.5A and B.
              | In particular at the lowest reaction pressure of 2.7 bar and highest S/C ratio, 3.5, a
              | methane conversion and hydrogen selectivity of 32.0% and 43.9% were obtained with
              | respect to 20.3% and 26.3% reached at the lowest S/C of 2.5.
              | Another parameter, related to the S/C ratio that also promotes conversion, is the
              | selectivity of CO and CO2 within the reactor. Table 5.1 shows the CO and CO2
              | selectivity relative to the S/C ratio and the reaction pressure. As the pressure decreases
              | and the S/C ratio increases, the selectivity of both CO and CO2 increase. This was due
              | to the increased conversion of methane, at lower operating pressures and higher steam-
              | to-carbon ratios, thus forming more products.

text          | In the experimental tests carried out with FBR1 it was found that there was a trade-off
              | between two important parameters, i.e., high hydrogen production and low CO
              | formation. In particular, the most hydrogen was produced under T = 500 °, preaction =
              | 2.7 bar, and S/C = 3.5, while the least amount of CO was produced at T = 400 °C,

text          | The FBR tests completed in this work are within the range of the literature values. For
              | example, at S/C = 3.0, p = 2.7 bar, and T = 400 °C the conversion of methane was ~
              | 25%, compared to the study of Shu et al., in which a methane conversion of 19% was
              | found, (Shu et al. 1995). Although the work of Shu et al. took place at a slightly lower
              | pressure, which from a thermodynamic point of view should increase conversion, the
              | catalyst used was loaded with 12% Ni compared to the ~ 15% Ni used in the current
              | work. This lower composition of active metal on the ceramic catalyst can cause a
              | lower conversion as observed in the previous work.

text          | In the second part of testing, a second reactor was connected to the outlet of the SMR
              | reactor with the intent to decrease the CO content in the outlet stream. For this reason,
              | 1.5 grams of an iron-chromium based commercial catalyst was packed in the second
              | reactor where the HT-WGS reaction took place. This collective configuration of two
              | catalyst beds, i.e., SMR and HT-WGS, was named FBR2.

              | GHSV between 2,600 h-1 to 10,000 h-1. The reaction temperature was also varied,
              | more specifically, for the SMR reaction it was in the range 350 and 800 °C, and for
              | the HT-WGS reaction between 350 and 400 °C.

text          | Figure 5.7 shows the amount of CO at the outlet stream in both configurations and it is
              | evident that the second reactor helps in the reduction of CO. The benefit of the added
              | HT-WGS reactor allows for the mitigation of CO at the outlet of the FBR2
              | configuration.              The CO production at SMR temperatures greater than 500 °C is
              | significantly lower for FBR2 than FBR1. At low SMR temperatures CO production
              | was very low for both of the FBRs due to low CH4 conversion and therefore it is
              | difficult to appreciate the positive effect of the HT-WGS reactor within FBR2.

text          | The positive effect of the presence of the HT-WGS reactor in FBR2 was also
              | noticeable on the hydrogen and CO2 production. This is due to the WGS catalyst,
              | which allows for the conversion of CO into hydrogen and carbon dioxide as shown in
              | Eq. 2.2. As can be seen from Figure 5.8 and 5.9, both hydrogen and CO2 production
              | from FBR2 were enhanced with respect to FBR1, and they become more pronounced
              | as the SMR temperature increases.

text          | Thus far, it has been shown that with the same conversion of methane for both FBR1
              | and FBR2, the mitigation of CO within FBR2 leads to a higher production of H2 and
              | CO2. This important attribute of FBR2 with the addition of a WGS catalytic bed
              | allows for further testing related to reaction pressure. The WGS catalytic bed is
              | minimally affected by pressure, because the WGS equation (Eq. 2.2) has an equal
              | number of moles for the products as well as the reactants. Nonetheless, it has been
              | shown in the literature that the reaction rate is slightly enhanced, i.e., more CO is
              | converted at higher pressures (Newsome 1980, Mendes et al. 2010). In order to
              | demonstrate this effect, the CO selectivity versus pressure was plotted and is shown in
              | Figure 5.10.

text          | The influence of the GHSV on the SMR and WGS reactions was also investigated. In
              | particular, GHSV was varied between four different set points: 2,600 h-1, 4,200 h-1,
              | 5,200 h-1, and 10,000 h-1. The study was conducted with TSMR = 800 °C and S/C = 3.5.
              | Although the GHSV decreases the residence time within the reactor that leads to less
              | time for the reactants to react across the catalyst and the methane conversion was
              | found to be ~ 100% at each GHSV. The FBR2 product flow rate versus GHSV is
              | shown in Figure 5.11.

text          | The effect of varying the HT-WGS reactor temperature between 350 °C and 400 °C
              | was studied by investigating the performance of the FBR2. In particular, the lowest
              | and highest GHSV, i.e., 2600 h-1 and 10,000 h-1 were used with the constant operating
              | conditions of reaction pressure equal to 2.7 bar, TSMR at 800 °C and S/C = 3.5. The
              | total production of H2 and the CO selectivity of FBR2 versus GHSV at different
              | temperatures are shown in Figure 5.12. As the temperature of the bed decreases from
              | 400 °C to 350 °C, the hydrogen production increases while the CO selectivity
              | decreases for both GHSVs studied due to the exothermic nature of the WGS reaction.

text          | In the FBR3 configuration, a third reactor was connected to the outlet of the FBR2. In
              | this reactor 1.0 g of a Cu-based commercial catalyst was packed where the LT-WGS
              | reaction took place. Therefore, FBR3 had three separate reactors: SMR, HT-WGS, and
              | LT-WGS. FBR3 was built to further mitigate CO formation and increase both H2 and
              | CO2 production. Operating conditions of TSMR = 800 °C, THT-WGS = 400 °C, TLT-WGS =
              | 200 °C and S/C = 3.5 were chosen and kept constant. These parameters are related to
              | the best performance obtained during the experimental tests in FBR1 and FBR2. The
              | influence of GHSV varied between 2,600h-1 and 4,200h-1 and reaction pressures
              | between 1.0 and 2.7 bar were investigated.

text          | The FBR3 reactor, having three different packed beds of catalyst, i.e., SMR, HT-
              | WGS, and LT-WGS emulated industrial operations the closest. The incremental
              | differences across all of the FBR configurations allowed for increased performance
              | related to the methane conversion and CO mitigation. Specifically for FBR3, with the
              | addition of a LT-WGS catalyst bed, the production of CO should be the lowest of the
              | three FBRs.

text          | The effect of GHSV on the CO production was investigated using of 2,600 h-1 and
              | 4,200 h-1 and the results were compared to FBR2. Figure 5.14 shows the CO
              | selectivity versus GHSV for both FBR2 and FBR3.
              | FBR3 with the additional of the LT-WGS reactor produced a smaller amount of CO at
              | each GHSV. The decrease in CO selectivity from FBR2 to FBR3 is apparent with a
              | 72% decrease at a GHSV of 2,600 h-1 and a 50% decrease at a GHSV of 4,200 h-1.

text          | The CO selectivity increases by increasing the GHSV due to the lower residence time
              | within the reactor, which decreases the contact time between CO and the catalyst. This
              | decreased contact time results in a decreased CO conversion, Eq. 2.2 and an increasing
              | of CO selectivity. As CO decreases, the production of CO2 and H2 increase by way of
              | the WGS reaction, Eq. 2.2. Specifically the production of CO2 within FBR3 is
              | increased by 1.5 times and 1.3 times compared to FBR2 by using GHSV 2,600 h-1 and
              | 4,200 h-1. Moreover, H2 production is also increased by 1.4 and 1.5 times at respective

text          | As shown throughout this series of experiments, 100% conversion of methane was
              | achievable at an SMR reaction temperature of 800 °C. This conversion allows for high

              | 
text          | Experimental testing commenced by using two membranes, an unsupported Pd
              | membrane foil and a tubular composite Pd membrane supported on PSS, for the
              | purpose of hydrogen permeation. The unsupported dense Pd foil, PdF1, was bought
              | from Goodfellow and had a thickness of 30 µm with a surface area of 1.79 x10-4 m2. A
              | photograph of a Pd foil housed within the Hastelloy X module is shown in Figure 6.1.
              | In particular, a porous stainless steel support was used for holding the membrane and
              | to avoid cracking during the tests at high pressure, and a graphite gasket was used to
              | ensure sealing between the retentate and permeate sides. The Pd/PSS composite
              | tubular membrane used for permeation testing, Ma-2, had ~ 8.5 µm of a Pd layer
              | deposited on PSS and a total active surface area of ~ 6.5 cm2. Further details on the
              | setup used for testing Ma-2 are reported in Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2.

              | 
text          | The Ma-2 and PdF1 membranes differ fundamentally by their fabrication techniques.
              | In particular, the first was lab-made by using electroless plating, and the second one
              | was manufactured by rolling. The different methods for fabricating the composite
              | membranes are described in greater detail throughout Chapter 8. It is important to note
              | that composite membranes have the potential to have defects that can be caused by a
              | number of reasons unlike unsupported membranes that tend to show complete
              | selectivity towards hydrogen permeation, unless cracked.

text          | The evaluation of the permeation characteristics of the Pd membranes first took place
              | by permeation measurements of pure gases. The permeating flux of each gas through
              | the membranes was measured using a bubble-flow meter with an average of 10
              | experimental points considered. Generally, at constant temperature, the equations used
              | for describing the hydrogen permeating flux through the dense Pd membrane is as
              | follows:

text          | In order to evaluate the permeating characteristics of the Pd membrane foil, PdF1,
              | permeation tests of pure gases, namely H2, Ar and He were performed between 365 to
              | 500 °C under varied trans-membrane pressures. In particular, the retentate pressure
              | was varied between 1.7 and 6.5 bar, whereas the permeate pressure was kept constant
              | at 1 bar. First, the permeation tests were performed with He and Ar to verify the
              | presence of any defect in the palladium layer. No He or Ar permeation flux was
              | detected in the permeate side at each temperature and pressure considered, which
              | means that the membrane was completely dense and defect-free. During the initial
              | permeation test with H2 it was found that the flux through PdF1 was not constant over
              | the first 24 hours. This was realized at a trans-membrane pressure of 4.1 bar and at T =
              | 450 °C; therefore, the temperature and pressure were held constant until the flux
              | stabilized. Figure 6.2 shows the initial increasing trend associated with hydrogen
              | permeation and the leveling off over time under a feed pressure of 4.1 bar at T = 450
              | °C.

text          | According to Eq. 6.4, as the temperature increases so will permeance through the Pd
              | foil. Additionally, the hydrogen flux increases as the partial pressure of hydrogen
              | across the Pd foil increases as is clearly shown by Eq. 6.1. Therefore, increasing the
              | feed pressure by decreasing the permeate partial pressure can increase hydrogen flux.
              | Also, it can be found that as the temperature and feed pressure increase, so does the
              | hydrogen flux through PdF1. After a prolonged period of time under different
              | operating temperatures and pressures, PdF1 started to become permeable to helium,
              | which indicated that the Pd metal cracked or became spoiled. Therefore, the
              | membrane module was cooled down and the membrane was removed.

text          | One method to visually inspect the Pd surface and to determine its extent of

              | membrane pressures was infinite (after flow measurements, no detection was found
              | via MS with a lower detection limit of 100 ppb). This indicates that the membrane is

text          | The long-term stability of the Ma-2 composite membrane was also studied. Therefore,
              | permeation tests of hydrogen and helium took place for one month, with the
              | membrane mostly under a hydrogen environment at T = 400 °C. After some time, the
              | membrane began to degrade. In particular, although the membrane exhibited infinite
              | selectivity for hydrogen in the presence of a small trans-membrane pressure, the ideal
              | selectivity of H2/He decreased from infinity at trans-membrane pressures below 3.4
              | bar to 850 at 7.6 bar. In Table 6.2 the ideal selectivity as a function of the trans-
              | membrane pressure is reported. This decreasing trend can be attributed to the defects
              | of the membrane, which potentially are caused by impurities present during the
              | electroless plating fabrication of the membrane (Liguori, Iulianelli et al. 2014). These

text          | These results indicate that the composite Pd-based membrane is not defect-free and
              | not fully selective to hydrogen permeation with respect to all other gases as was
              | previously hypothesized; therefore, n cannot be 0.5 as the initial tests found, and needs
              | to be instead determined from Eq. 6.1. At 400 °C, the hydrogen permeating flux was
              | plotted against the difference in partial pressure of hydrogen to the power of n and a
              | linear regression equation with associated R2 was used for each n as shown in Figure
              | 6.9. The best linear fit corresponding to the highest coefficient of determination, R2,
              | was found to be between n values of 0.5 and 0.6, i.e., n = 0.57. Therefore, the transport
              | of hydrogen through the membrane is mainly limited by the diffusion through the bulk
              | palladium phase. Nevertheless, a deviation from 0.5 indicates that the permeation of
              | hydrogen may be influenced by a combination of other factors such as Pd surface
              | impurities, Pd surface or bulk defects, i.e., organic contaminants from fabrication or
              | pinholes, respectively (Paglieri and Way 2002, Guazzone, Engwall et al. 2006).

text          | Testing the hydrogen permeation with a dense Pd foil at various temperatures and
              | pressures allowed for a complete understanding of the mechanism in which hydrogen
              | permeates through palladium as described by Eq. 6.1. The initial conditions of the foil
              | showed that the hydrogen permeation could take up to two days for steady state to be
              | reached. Further evaluation took place by varying the pressure and temperature to
              | understand the effects on the palladium foil as shown by Eq. 6.5. After the membrane
              | became permeable to helium, indicating that palladium gained structural defects, SEM
              | images were taken for further understanding of the Pd surface. These images revealed
              | deformities on the foil surface that were thought to be associated with the thermal
              | expansion and contraction of the foil within the module.

              | 
text          | Additional testing took place using a Pd/PSS composite membrane for the evaluation
              | of hydrogen permeation. The Pd/PSS membrane was initially completely dense and
              | only selective towards hydrogen; however, over time the helium flux became apparent
              | above a trans-membrane pressure of 3.4 bar. After testing was complete the system
              | was cooled down and investigation of the Pd membrane showed visual defects on the
              | surface.

text          | The ability of the Pd-based MR to enhance the reaction performance in terms of
              | conversion, under fixed operating conditions, is proportional to the membrane
              | thickness. In particular, the thinner the metallic layer deposited on the porous support,
              | the higher the hydrogen permeation flux. This produces a more pronounced shift
              | effect, which induces an increase in conversion. Therefore, even at low operating
              | temperatures of 400 °C, significant improvement in conversion can be achieved using
              | a Pd-based MR even overcoming the equilibrium conversion. For example, Kikuchi et
              | al. (Kikuchi et al. 1991) measured a CH4 conversion of 64% at 400 °C whereas the
              | calculated equilibrium value was < 20% for a fixed bed reactor (FBR) at the same
              | operating conditions (Liu et al. 2002, Schädel et al. 2009). This high conversion of
              | CH4 leads to co-benefits of the MR technology, i.e., a pure hydrogen stream collected
              | on the permeate side of the membrane with zero emissions if the pure hydrogen is fed
              | to a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) (Bredesen et al. 2004, Atsonios et
              | al. 2012, Abanades et al. 2015).

text          | Although there is a significant amount of literature on the performance of Pd-based
              | MRs at elevated temperatures, i.e., >500 °C for performing SMR experiments
              | (Nazarkina et al. 1979, Oertel et al. 1987, Uemiya et al. 1990, Nam et al. 2000, Tong

              | experimental tests, as shown in Table 7.1, have focused on this reaction at
              | temperatures as low as 400 °C. For example, Gallucci et al. (Gallucci et al. 2004) and
              | Jørgensen et al. (Jørgensen et al. 1995) performed SMR experiments at 400 °C using a

text          | (Jørgensen et al. 1995) used a higher reaction pressure, which corresponds to a higher
              | hydrogen driving force through the membrane, they gained a lower conversion
              | compared to the study of Gallucci et al. (Gallucci et al. 2004), due to the higher
              | membrane thickness, which subsequently caused a lower shift effect. Kikuchi et al.
              | (Kikuchi et al. 1991), reached a CH4 conversion of 64% at a pressure of 100 kPa
              | operating with a composite Pd/Al2O3 membrane, whereas Lin et al. (Lin et al. 2003)
              | and Shu et al. (Shu et al. 1994), housing a composite Pd/PSS membrane in a MR,
              | achieved 34% and 19% conversion at a pressures of 910 kPa and 136 kPa,
              | respectively. Kikuchi et al. (Kikuchi et al. 1991) obtained a higher conversion due to a
              | thinner membrane thickness with respect to the other two studies (Lin et al. 2003) and
              | (Shu et al. 1994). Moreover, Lin et al. (Lin et al. 2003) applied both a higher reaction
              | pressure and sweep gas with respect to Shu et al. (Shu et al. 1994), which induced a
              | higher hydrogen driving force and greater shift effect resulting in improved MR
              | performance. In all of these studies, a hydrogen purity of nearly 100% was obtained.
              | As evident in these studies the membrane thickness, the reaction pressures, and the
              | sweep gas rate play an important role in the MR system.

text          | The aim of the current work is to investigate the effect of the reaction pressure and
              | sweep gas rate on the performance of a thin Pd/PSS membrane housed in a MR at a
              | low operating temperature of 400°C. Also, a low concentration of CO2 is added to the

              | investigate its influence on the MR performance. In addition, a comparison between

              | and a FBR working at the same operating conditions is given and discussed.
              | Furthermore, experimental data from the open literature are reported and compared

text          | The composite Pd-based membrane was characterized by a thin Pd layer deposited via
              | electroless plating on a PSS support. The Pd layer calculated gravimetrically was ~ 13
              | µm thick with a total active surface area of ~ 44 cm2.. The PSS support was furnished
              | by Mott Corporation (2300 series), with an active length of 15 cm and an outer
              | diameter of 1 cm. The membrane was fabricated in the Center for Inorganic
              | Membrane Studies at Worcester Polytechnic Institute by using a similar procedure to
              | Ma et al. (Ma et al. 2000, Ma et al. 2007, Ma et al. 2013). This procedure consists of
              | support polishing to reduce the surface roughness, its cleaning in an ultrasonic bath,
              | support oxidation in an oven to create an intermediate layer and avoid intermetallic
              | diffusion, support activation and successive deposition of the Pd-layer by electroless
              | plating. The membrane was welded on both sides to a stainless steel tube with one end
              | being welded closed.

text          | A commercial Ni-based SMR catalyst supplied by Johnson Matthey Inc. was used.
              | Before packing 3 g of catalyst in the annular region of the MR, it was crushed and
              | sieved to an approximate particle size of 200 – 400 µm, in order to increase the
              | available surface area for the SMR reaction and to avoid pressure drop in the catalytic
              | bed. The specified working temperature of the membrane, based on the experience of
              | the manufacturers (Yi Hua Ma 2014), was 400 – 500 °C. The MR schematic is shown
              | in Figure 7.1.

text          | A schematic showing the experimental setup used to carry out the SMR experiments is
              | shown Figure 7.2. The MR system was heated using heating tape controlled by a
              | voltage controller (Glas-Col) and the temperature was monitored via a K-type
              | thermocouple (Omega Engineering) housed in the permeate side of the MR. Pure
              | gases were regulated and supplied to the MR via Aalborg GFC17 thermal mass flow
              | controllers, distilled water was supplied through an Eldex 1LMP pump, which was
              | vaporized and mixed with gases prior to entering in the MR, a temperature-regulated
              | water bath (Julabo F25-EH) was used to condense water vapor from the retentate and
              | an Extrel Max-300LG Mass Spectrometer (MS) was utilized for analyzing the
              | composition of dry gas species coming from both retentate and permeate sides. Before
              | beginning experiments, the MS was calibrated using the standard addition method

text          | In order to evaluate the permeating characteristics of the membrane, permeation tests
              | of pure gases, namely H2, Ar and He were performed at 400 °C under varied trans-
              | membrane pressures. In particular, He and Ar permeation measurements were

              | used to calculate the ideal selectivities !!!   !"   and !!!   !"   (Eq. 7.1). In Table 7.2, the

text          | These results indicate that the composite Pd-based membrane was not defect-free and
              | not fully selective to hydrogen permeation with respect to all other gases at high
              | pressure, although the ideal selectivity was still high (i.e. 9,000 and 40,000 at trans-
              | membrane pressure of 200 kPa). In order to establish the membrane characteristics
              | toward hydrogen permeation, the parameters such as !! , !! and n (Eq. 7.2-3) need to
              | be estimated. Therefore, permeation measurements with pure hydrogen at different
              | temperatures and trans-membrane pressures were performed.

text          | Figure 7.4 shows the CH4 conversion vs. the reaction pressure at different sweep gas
              | flow rates. As displayed, the !!"! (Eq. 7.4) increases with increasing reaction pressure
              | as well as argon sweep rate. This increasing trend is caused by a growing shift effect
              | promoted by a higher hydrogen permeation driving force. In particular, Eq. 7.2 shows
              | that an increase in the reaction pressure results in an increased H2 partial pressure in
              | the retentate stream. This in turn causes a higher H2 permeation flux through the
              | membrane, thereby causing more hydrogen to be removed from the reaction zone,
              | driving the reactions (Eq. 2.1 – 2.3) towards further product formation and resulting in
              | an increase in !!"! . Furthermore, the H2 permeate partial pressure may be lowered by
              | introducing a sweep gas, which causes an increase in the hydrogen permeation driving
              | force and thus an increased shift effect. The maximum !!"! obtained was 84% at 400
              | °C with a sweep gas flow rate of 100 mL/min and a reaction pressure of 300 kPa. In
              | contrast, the minimum !!"! obtained was 68% using an argon sweep flow rate of 25
              | mL/min and 49% using no argon sweep under a reaction pressure of 100 kPa.
              | Additionally, by using the highest reaction pressure, i.e., 300 kPa and lowering the
              | argon sweep to 25% of the maximum rate, the !!"! decreases only to 73.6%.

title         | 7.2.2.3 Influence of CO2 in the feed
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
text          | To investigate the impact of the presence of CO2 in the feed, the SMR reaction was
              | performed by adding 6 vol.% CO2 into the feed stream to simulate a common impurity
              | contained within natural gas. Exact specifications for the CO2 content in natural gas
              | pipelines do not exist (Processing 2006); however, CO2 does not add heating value to
              | natural gas and thus is minimized below 3 vol.% for transportation via pipelines
              | within the U.S. (Rufford et al. 2012). For this set of experiments, CO2 was important
              | since it is a product of the SMR reaction (2.1 & 2.2) and, from a thermodynamic
              | perspective, an increase in product concentration leads to a decrease in conversion.
              | This negative effect is evident in Fig. 6 where !!"! (Figure 7.6A) as well as HR
              | (Figure 7.6B) versus different sweep gas flow rates are shown. In particular, !!"!
              | decreases from 67% to 61% and from 70% to 66% by using 25 mL/min and 50
              | mL/min as sweep flow rate, respectively. As a consequence, the HR decreases from
              | 46% to 41% and from 53% to 51% by using a rate of 25 mL/min and 50 mL/min.
              | Nevertheless, the negative effect of the presence of CO2 on !!"! and HR is partially
              | negated by using a higher sweep flow rate. The higher hydrogen permeation driving
              | force, caused by the higher sweep rate, leads to an increase in hydrogen collected in
              | the permeate stream. The increased sweep gas flow rate acts to remove more of the
              | hydrogen within the permeate and maintain the trans-membrane H2 partial pressure
              | differential, leading to an increase in !!"! . Thus, with an increase in the permeate
              | sweep rate (e.g., 50 mL/min), the negative effect due to the CO2 presence is reduced,
              | with a 3% difference in !!"! and 2% difference in HR.

              | It is clear that the ideal selectivity drops notably within the first 250 experimental
              | hours from nearly infinite to 600 and continues to slowly decrease over the course of
              | the remaining experiments. Although the precise mechanism of this decline is not fully

              | instability of the grains formed by the electroless plating process to abnormal grain
              | growth. Similarly Bryden et al. (Bryden et al. 1995) found that Pd grain growth can

              | al. (Mardilovich et al. 1998) found that large pores within the PSS support can create
              | pore gaps within the Pd layer upon heating, which were undiscovered during room
              | temperature permeation testing. Lastly, intermetallic diffusion may aid in the ideal

text          | The performance of a composite Pd-based PSS-supported membrane reactor (MR)
              | fabricated by electroless plating was investigated through a series of experiments via
              | performing SMR reaction. In particular, the effect of different reaction pressures, as
              | well as permeate sweep gas rates, on MR performance in terms of methane
              | conversion, hydrogen recovery and hydrogen permeate purity was studied. Moreover,
              | the effect of a common impurity, CO2, contained within natural gas has also been
              | analyzed. A methane conversion of 84% was reached using an Ar sweep rate of 100

text          | The pressure and temperature conditions are significantly lower than the current
              | industrial method for producing hydrogen via SMR. To further emphasize the
              | performance of the MR, the SMR reaction tests at 400 °C were also investigated in a
              | FBR configuration. The outcome shows that the methane conversion is higher by 57%
              | in the MR configuration compared to the FBR, and produced double the amount of
              | hydrogen. Initially, the membrane showed a near-infinite selectivity towards hydrogen
              | permeation at pressures less than 100 kPa. After 750 experimental hours, the ideal
              | selectivity of hydrogen with respect to Ar dropped to 30. Nevertheless, no CO was
              | detected in the permeate side for all the experimental campaigns, which shows that as
              | the membrane slowly degraded, it had the ability to still produce CO-free hydrogen for
              | feeding a fuel cell or for other hydrogen-sourced industrial applications.

text          | Another important parameter to be considered is the study of the performance of
              | Pd/PSS MR with varied sweep gas flow rate. Indeed, it has been shown that the higher
              | the sweep gas flow rate the higher the hydrogen recovery as well as the higher the
              | conversion So far in this work Ar was used for the simplicity in the management of
              | the experimental testing. However, the use of argon isn’t practical for obtaining pure
              | hydrogen from the MR, nor would it be convenient for on-board applications owing to
              | the necessity to obtain pure hydrogen stream. Therefore, the use of steam as a sweep

text          | The methane conversion, !!"! decreased by ~ 5% for all sweep rates when steam was
              | used as a permeate sweep instead of argon and, as a consequence, the HR decreased
              | by ~7% across all sweep rates investigated. In other words, the lowest sweep rate
              | value of argon produced the same results as the highest steam sweep rate value. In
              | particular, a methane conversion of ~ 72% and HR of ~73% are obtained by using a
              | steam sweep rate of 215 mL/min or argon sweep gas of 100 mL/min.

text          | Further testing was performed to check any long-term effect on the membrane after

              | steam sweep were carried out and it was found that there was no difference in
              | performance before or after the use of steam as a permeate sweep was detected.
              | Hence, no long-term effects on the membrane system were experienced.

text          | The conclusion of these results indicates that the performance of the MR system
              | decreased slightly when steam is used as a sweep gas instead of argon. The solution
              | for this slight decrease in performance would be due to an increase in the steam sweep
              | rate or, increase the membrane area to allow for more permeation of hydrogen. The
              | second solution may be more feasible since this would require more energy for heating

              | the Al2O3 particles worked well to prevent the intermetallic diffusion, thereby
              | avoiding the degradation of the Pd membrane (Rothenberger et al. 2004). The other
              | elemental plots of Fe, Ni, Ca, S, and Si are all associated with the supporting stainless
              | steel material and with the material used for polishing the area. The C, Al, and O
              | signals can come from some particles of catalyst being deposited on the membrane
              | (from the reaction) or when the membrane was polished even though it was cleaned,
              | which could have lead to some pieces of catalyst being spread across the surface of the

text          | During the course of the experimental tests, the membrane degraded to a !!!     !"   of 30.
              | SEM images concluded that the formation of holes within the Pd layer were prevalent,
              | which was the main reasoning for such a low ideal selectivity. Additional information
              | from SEM showed that the Pd layer was in good agreement with the gravimetrical
              | estimate of    ~ 13 µm. Further knowledge was obtained relating to the surface
              | morphology and possible carbon deposition along the Pd surface. The EMPA analysis
              | showed that even with carbon on the surface, the Pd signal was strong thus indicating
              | that the deposition of carbon was minimal on the membrane surface. Another take
              | away from this analysis was that intermetallic diffusion did not take place, reassuring
              | that the oxide layer and alumina fulfilled its requirement. Additionally, there was no
              | clear information as to the actual cause of membrane failure; just the holes within the
              | Pd surface were formed. Further information and other possible degradation pathways
              | can be found in the Chapter 8, Section 9.

              | 
text          | The fabrication of several hydrogen-selective membranes to be used for the SMR
              | reaction testing took place in professor Y.H. (Ed) Ma’s lab at Worcester Polytechnic
              | Institute’s Center for Inorganic Membranes. The electroless plating technique was
              | used for depositing a Pd layer on both PSS and ceramic (Al2O3) supports, whereas the
              | electro-plating technique was utilized for depositing the Au layer. The multistep
              | fabrication process, which is described in great detail in various patents by (Ma et al.
              | 2007, Ma et al. 2008) and in more detail in (Mardilovich et al. 1998) and (Ma et al.
              | 2003) was used to manufacture the membranes outlined in this chapter.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | All six of the produced membranes were named in the following way for ease in
              | referencing. The Pall PSS supports were named DR1, DR2, and DR3. The two
              | ceramic supports were named AlO1 and AlO2 and the GKN PSS support kept its
              | designation as GKN. Each membrane was prepared differently to highlight various
              | attributes of the fabrication process, which helped in gaining perspective and allowed
              | for a complete matrix of properties that influence reaction testing to be created, which
              | is beneficial when developing an overall system with a particular feedstock in mind.
              | The focus of this chapter is to describe the methodology of each of the fabrication
              | steps and to characterize the membrane by checking the leak rate using pure He.
              | Reaction testing data using the membranes outlined in this chapter can be found in
              | other experimental chapters of this PhD thesis.

title         | 8.2 Membrane Details - DR1
blank         | 
text          | The fabrication of DR1 started with a Pall AccuSep PSS support having a deposited
              | layer of zirconia with an approximate thickness of 10 µm on the outer surface. The
              | average pore size of the porous stainless steel as well as the zirconia was 3 µm and 0.1
              | µm, respectfully. An SEM image showing the cross section of the support is illustrated
              | in Figure 8.1. The outer diameter of the support was 1 cm (3/8”) and the total active
              | length of the porous support was 4 cm completely covered by ZrO2 with ~ 2 mm of
              | overlap on each side of the welded joint between porous and non-porous stainless
              | steel. The overlap is used to minimize leakage within the welded zone. The ZrO2 layer
              | reduces the pore size of the porous stainless steel (PSS) support and also serves as an
              | intermediate layer that prevents intermetallic diffusion between palladium and PSS.

              | The total length of the support was ~ 21 cm and was not enough to ensure complete
              | housing in the module; therefore, stainless steel (SS) tubes were welded on either end
              | of the support to obtain the required length of ~ 40 cm, as well as a metal plug welded

text          | Figure 8.5 – Close up photograph of the active layer of Zr on the Pall PSS support, a)
              | initial state b) after polishing with alumina paper.
              | After obtaining the initial permeation data, the support was polished with alumina
              | paper to increase the roughness of the surface, which subsequently increases the
              | adhesion of the palladium layer to be deposited. Notice in Figure 8.5a that the layer of
              | Zr on the support is shiny (reflected light is visible) and smooth, which may lead to
              | minimal adhesion of the plated Pd and, hence, may cause delamination. This negative
              | outcome needs to be avoided if adequate, long-term use of the membrane is desired. In
              | order to mitigate the chances of delamination, the active area was lightly sanded with
              | alumina-based 1500 grit sandpaper to ensure a certain roughness as is shown in Figure
              | 8.5b. After the sanding was complete the permeation process was repeated and the
              | weight was measured (39.895g). The resulting He flux versus trans-membrane
              | pressure graph was indistinguishable from Figure 8.4 leading to the conclusion that the
              | sanding of the Zr surface did not have a negative impact on the support and therefore
              | did not hinder He flux. Afterwards, the support was washed with deionized (DI) water
              | to ensure the removal of any loose partials left from sanding and then placed in the
              | oven at 140°C overnight. Once preparation was complete, the deposition of the Pd
              | layer could begin, which consists of two main steps, i.e., activation and plating. In the
              | first step, i.e., activation, Pd seeds are deposited on the surface whereas in the second

              | the old plating solution was replaced with new solution and placed in different
              | glassware. In particular, the glassware with the used solution was soaked in aqua regia
              | (HNO3+3HCl) for 90 minutes to ensure removal of metallic particles that could be
              | deposited on the glass surface during the plating cycle. After two cycles, i.e., a total of

text          | After the membrane was dried at 140 °C overnight, the weight was measured,

              | from the pre-activation preparation of the support and ZrO2 layer. Visual inspection
              | provided insight into the Pd layer thickness and adhesion integrity of the Pd layer to
              | the membrane PSS support. The Pd layer was calculated to be 7.45-µm thick based on
              | weight difference and Pd plating area, which was different from the PSS support
              | active area. Indeed, Figure 8.6 shows there was ~ 0.5 cm gap on each side of the
              | support area that needed to be accounted for. With a total surface area of 16.65 cm2,

text          | These He flow rates are not acceptable because the membrane in theory should be
              | selective to only H2. One idea behind why He permeates through the membrane is that
              | there may have been defects within the ZrO2 layer on the initial Pall PSS support thus
              | preventing an even distribution of Pd across the support. In order to fill these larger
              | pores, further Pd plating should take place with vacuum on the permeation side to
              | draw the Pd towards the larger pore sites.

text          | Based on the permeation tests, it could be determined that the ideal selectivity between
              | H2 and He in the membrane was not infinite. Therefore, the membrane, as it was
              | fabricated, was not suitable for SMR reaction testing. In order to further mitigate He
              | permeation, the activation and plating steps were repeated. In particular, after only two
              | cycles of activation (total of 40 min), the membrane was placed into the plating cycle
              | three times (total 270 min) with vacuum on the permeate side.

              | of SS welded on each end of the PSS support and one end capped with a metal plug.
              | The initial weight of DR2 was 40.542g. The initial He permeation data was collected
              | and the support was sanded to remove most of the ZrO2 layer, i.e., sanded until the
              | PSS under the ZrO2 layer was mostly exposed, which differed from DR1 (DR1’s ZrO2
              | layer was only lightly sanded). The weight after sanding was 40.509g and is shown in
              | Figure 8.17. The permeation data was performed again, which concluded that the He
              | flow through the support was indistinguishable from the testing prior to sanding. This
              | means that the remaining ZrO2 covers most of the larger defects of the membrane as

              | diffusion of Pd into the porous support. An activated slurry was prepared and used for
              | the purpose of an intermediate layer. The slurry mixture, as shown in Figure 8.16,
              | consisted of 2 wt.% Pd deposited on Al2O3 particles with an average diameter of 0.6
              | µm (obtained from Johnson Matthey) mixed by using a stirring plate for at least 2h in
              | DI H2O at a ratio of 1 g Pd active particles to 500 mL H2O. The Pd in the slurry was
              | used to deposit several Pd seeds on the membrane surface and to avoid the first Pd

text          | The procedure took place as follows: 1) the support was wrapped in PTFE, 2) vacuum
              | was applied to the permeation side and 3) the support was soaked in DI H2O for 5
              | minutes, then 4) it was placed in the slurry for 2 minutes and agitated creating a ‘soft’
              | active layer on the support, 5) the soft layer needed to be cemented, i.e., dried in air
              | for 1 minute, and 6) followed by 10 minutes of Pd plating without vacuum (same
              | method used for the previous DR1 support). After this initial plating was complete, the
              | vacuum was applied to ensure the Pd was drawn into the defects and pores and the
              | PTFE tape was removed with the SS area thoroughly cleaned. Following this, it was
              | placed one minute in air, five minutes in H2O and then another five more minutes in
              | the well-mixed slurry. Afterwards, the support was lightly rubbed to ensure that the
              | slurry found its way into the defects and pores. This mechanical pressure was key to
              | ensuring a worthy intermediate layer. After the non-permeable area was cleaned, the
              | support went back into the Pd plating process for another 90 minutes followed by heat
              | treatment at 140 °C overnight. This last cycle of Pd plating can be considered the

              | with the permeate side under vacuum. The thickness of the Pd layer was calculated to
              | be 6.76 µm and post permeation tests concluded that the membrane’s He flux had

              | and 3 cycles Pd plating with vacuum for a total of 4.5 h) the permeation test concluded
              | that the He flux through the membrane dropped by ~50%, with a calculated Pd layer

              | The initial weight of DR3 was 40.107g. Initial permeation data was conclusive with a
              | linear fitting of 0.998. The preparation of this membrane was based on the best
              | outcome of the previous two membranes prepared, i.e., DR1 and DR2. Therefore this
              | membrane followed the same preparation as DR2 with the slurry mixture owing to the
              | benefit for the synthesis of a thinner membrane. After the deposition of the
              | intermediate layer and drying the membrane thoroughly, the Pd layer did not adhere to
              | the surface well enough to move forward; therefore, it was sanded down to the PSS
              | and oxidized at 500 °C (further details about oxidization can be found in Section 8.5).

text          | The GKN PSS support was unlike the DR materials (Pall support) because it did not
              | have a ZrO2 layer on top of the PSS and the support’s active surface area was more
              | than double that of the Pall supports. The support has an OD of 1 cm, porous length of
              | ~ 10 cm and is characterized by a porosity grade of 0.2 – 0.5 µm. The support is
              | welded on both sides with SS for housing it within the module. The initial weight of
              | the support was 76.892g with a measured active length of 9.8 cm. After initial
              | permeation data was taken with He, the membrane was placed in an oven (Lindberg
              | Blue M 732) for 10 hours at 500 °C (rate up 3 °C/min and rate down 5 °C/min) in
              | order to oxidize the surface of the PSS. The initial support and the post oxidation
              | support are shown in Figure 8.19. The reason for oxidation was two-fold, the first was
              | to reduce the pore size of the support and the second was to limit the intermetallic
              | diffusion of PSS and Pd, which can take place at elevated temperatures. Further details
              | on this method can be found in the patent (Ma et al. 2013).

              | Unfortunately, the permeation set-up within WPI’s lab did not allow for initial testing
              | to be conducted on the Al2O3 supports and hence, the supports were directly prepared,

              | 120 min, 3rd – 90 min under perm vacuum). In order to handle the support in a safe
              | manner, a custom nylon holder was made, as shown in Figure 8.22.

text          | The initial weight of the first Al2O3 support, named AlO1, was 11.607 g and the
              | weight after the first Pd activation-plating session was 11.895 g, with the Pd thickness
              | gravimetrically calculated as 8.88 µm (using a plating length of 8.6 µm). Although
              | initial permeation testing could not be conducted, a quick check for any defects took
              | place with slight positive pressure applied on the permeate side of the membrane with
              | Snoop® sprayed on the Pd layer1. This quick check revealed that the membrane did
              | have some larger pores, but that they were uniform across the Pd layer. Furthermore,
              | visual inspection of the Pd layer showed some Pd flaking at one end of the membrane
              | that was initially thought to be delamination of the Pd layer. However, after rinsing the
              | membrane the flakes disappeared, which indicated that the membrane was not rinsed
              | thoroughly after the Pd plating session. Following this, the membrane was treated
              | again and was activated for two cycles (40 min total) followed by 3 Pd plating cycles
              | (4.5 h total) with a permeation-side vacuum applied and dried overnight. The

              | thickness of the Pd layer to 15.02 µm. However, the upper surface of the membrane
              | showed numerous crystallized hillocks, which could have been from contamination or
              | from an improperly completed step. Sanding the Pd layer down by about 2 µm
              | (thickness based on weight difference), provided a smoother surface (final weight of
              | 12.029). In order to seal any pores that were exposed, the membrane was activated

text          | Further investigation into the membrane’s rough surface appearance concluded that
              | the vacuum had a negative impact on the support. After this discovery, the permeate
              | side vacuum was no longer used during Pd plating. Furthermore, in order to better
              | characterize the membrane, hardware was fabricated that allowed for permeation
              | testing to be conducted on the Al2O3 membranes at low trans-membrane pressures (~
              | 0.35 bar). Moving forward, the permeation testing concluded that after each Pd-plating
              | cycle, the He flux was further diminished. Figure 8.23 shows AlO1 throughout the
              | fabrication process as well as the negative impact from the vacuum being applied to
              | the permeate side. The final Pd-layer thickness of the AlO1 membrane was estimated

              | throughout this chapter have Au as a layer on top or in between the Pd layers.
              | Experimental testing (Chen et al. 2010) has concluded that with a PSS supported Pd-

              | holding the Pd-Au membrane to 600 °C while conducting H2 permeation testing it was
              | possible to realize steady-state permeation. This study also concluded that although

              | now, the optimization of the material properties of alloying the Pd-Au membranes.
              | Therefore, the Pd-Au alloy membranes fabricated in this work will be heated up to 450

text          | As expressed in Eq. 8.3, the plating solution and hydrazine form the desired Pd0,
              | which will initially bond to the seeded nuclei and will grow forming a thin layer at a
              | rate of ~1.5 µm/h. Also during this plating process the N2 is given off in the form of
              | bubbles (Figure 8.10), which is a visual indication that the metallic plating process is
              | taking place. However, it does not indicate exactly where the Pd is being deposited,
              | i.e., the Pd can deposit onto the surface of the glassware housing the membrane and/or

              | visual inspection of the membrane is required by removing the beaker from the heated
              | bath. As a rule of thumb if the solution is dark grey in color before the allotted plating
              | time this indicates “crashing” and the plating solution needs replacement.
              | Furthermore, if the solution is light grey in color towards the end of the allotted Pd

              | dimension, as well as having mechanical, chemical and thermal durability. The

blank         | 
text          | The initial support of the metallic membrane has a specific average pore size that is
              | known at the end of its fabrication and is provided by the manufacturer. However, this
              | average only gives a statistical range of the pore sizes and fabrication of each support
              | can contain some defects. The defects can lead to several larger pores of several
              | micrometers in diameter within the supporting material. In particular, these initial
              | defects can become problematic if the deposition of the intermetallic layer and the
              | subsequent metallic layer do not bridge the gap across the larger pores. A cartoon of
              | an undesirable and desirable situation that can take place is shown in Figure 8.24.

              | Another possible way for leak formation to occur is during the electroless plating
              | process. In particular, during the electroless plating process, Pd is deposited grain by
              | grain. The compilation of these nano-scale grains could lead to an imperfect surface
              | containing grain boundaries. These grains boundaries can allow for gases, other than
              | hydrogen, to permeate through the membrane. Although the precise mechanism for
              | leak growth is not fully understood, Kumpmann et al. (Kumpmann et al. 1993)

text          | attribute the thermodynamic instability of the grains formed by the electroless plating
              | process to abnormal grain growth. Similarly, Bryden et al. (Bryden et al. 1995) found
              | that Pd grain growth can start as low as 200 °C. Furthermore, for thin Pd composite
              | membranes, Mardilovich et al. (Mardilovich et al. 1998) found that larger pores within
              | the PSS support can create gaps within the Pd layer during heating.

title         | 8.9.2 Leak mitigation
blank         | 
text          | Before a leak can be fixed its location needs to be known. Usually two different
              | methods can be used for locating leaks. The first consists of soaking the membrane
              | surface in DI water and feeding He by applying a fixed trans-membrane pressure with
              | a higher pressure on the permeate side and water on the retentate side. The second
              | method is to spray a liquid on the surface of the membrane and apply less than 1 bar of
              | trans-membrane pressure on the permeation side of the membrane. The pinholes and
              | other defects in the membrane will be in the region of the bubble formation from the
              | liquid on the outer surface of the membrane.

              | 
text          | During the fabrication process in order to mitigate the undesirable outcome shown in
              | Figure 8.24, localized metallic plating can take place and/or grading of the initial
              | support with Al2O3 particles. Sometimes the intermediate layer is on the order of a few
              | microns thick for covering most of the larger defects. Moreover, as a rule of thumb,
              | the minimal Pd thickness deposited on the support has to be 3 times larger than the
              | average diameter of the pores (Ma et al. 2001, Mardilovich et al. 2002). This empirical
              | data stems from Professor Ma’s extensive experimental membrane fabrication
              | experience spanning over several decades. Furthermore, if a leak is very bad, i.e., not
              | localized or very high in one area, then grading can be completed across the entire
              | membrane to plug these larger pores with Al2O3 particles. The grading procedure is
              | explained in greater detail in Sections 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 for DR2, DR3 and GKN.

              | which the plating solution could grow and become thicker. For example DR2 had gold
              | bands deposited on the area where the PSS and SS were welded together. The Au
              | plating time was 2.5 hours and the estimated thickness of Au was ~30.8 µm, which

              |                            2. Final session plating (after Au layer) 2.0 mL H2NNH2
              |                                for 75 mL Pd plating
              |            c. This step is more a work of art with the Pd solution turning
              |                black/brown after some time if too much H2NNH2 is added.
              |                    i. The first cycle with DR1, the Pd solution turned black after ~
              |                        20min. Replacing the solution with a little bit less H2NNH2
              |                        solved the issue. If the solution changes color, it doesn’t mean
              |                        the plating will not be as effective.

text          | The results of the work presented in this chapter took place at the Institute on
              | Membrane Technology of the National Research Council (ITM – CNR), Italy. This
              | institute is part of the national research efforts by the Italian government and the
              | collective abbreviation used in Italy is ITM-CNR to distinguish this lab from the other
              | Italian national labs. With the amount of knowledge and expertise of the personnel
              | along with the experimental setup(s), the ability to conduct work at such a facility like
              | ITM was second to none. The ongoing research at ITM-CNR extended far beyond my
              | research scope and allowed for constructive conversations that allowed me to take my
              | research into directions that otherwise would not have been possible. With the
              | experience gained using Pd/PSS membranes, research relating to Al2O3 supported
              | membranes was a natural next step to expand my personal knowledge and experience.
              | The research plan at ITM-CNR involved testing on the personally fabricated Al2O3
              | supported Pd membrane, AlO2, within the MR setup supplied by ITM. The Al2O3
              | supports have high mechanical, chemical and thermal stability with the main benefits
              | being the small uniform pore size, on the order of nanometers, and operational
              | temperatures in excess of 1000 °C (Jayaraman et al. 1995, Kikuchi 1995, Xomeritakis
              | et al. 1996). One potential downside to the use of ceramic supported membranes is the
              | difficulty in obtaining a leak-free seal between the ceramic and metal joints (Matsuoka
              | 1994, Zhang et al. 2006). Further fabrication details about the Al2O3 supported Pd
              | membrane used, AlO2, can be found in the Section 8.6 of Chapter 8.

              | simulated natural gas mixture of methane w 3 mol.% N2 (further details on the
              | composition of NG can be found in the introduction of Chapter 10). More specifically,
              | the effect of the GHSV on the MR performance was evaluated at 4,400 h-1, 5,650 h-1,
              | and 6,850 h-1. In addition, CO2 was added to the feed to investigate its effect on the
              | reaction by considering that it is a product of the SMR reaction.

text          | The composite Pd-based membrane with a final layer of ~ 11 µm was fabricated via
              | ELP on a ceramic support and had a total active surface area ~ 23 cm2. The ceramic
              | support was obtained from Fraunhofer IKTS and had an active length of 7.4 cm and an
              | outer diameter of 1 cm. Further details on the fabrication of the membrane can be
              | found in Section 8.6 of Chapter 8. Reaction testing took place with 0.5 grams of Ni-
              | based catalyst obtained from Catal International Ltd. with a nominal size of 1 to 2 mm
              | that was first crushed into a fine powder, which caused pressure drop in the module.
              | Therefore the catalyst was left in its original size and then followed by testing. The
              | activation of the catalyst as instructed by the manufacturer took place at a temperature
              | of 400 °C for 2 hours under pure H2. The module that housed the membrane as well as
              | the catalyst was custom built to support ceramic membranes and sealed with graphite
              | O-rings. The entire module was tightened from both ends to make a completely sealed
              | unit equipped with a preheating zone as well as sweep gas capabilities. The
              | combination of catalyst and membrane into one unit used at ITM-CNR is shown in

text          | Table 9.2 shows the two different mixtures used for simulating natural gas. In

              | based on the U.S. natural gas pipeline standards (Mokhatab et al. 2012). The effect of
              | CO2 on MR performance is an important study since it is a product of the SMR
              | reaction (Eq. 2.2 and 2.3) and from a thermodynamic perspective, an increase in
              | product concentration leads to a decrease in conversion.

text          | Figure 9.3 shows the methane conversion, !!"! , and hydrogen recovery, HR, obtained
              | by feeding the two different mixtures. As can be seen from Figure 9.3, the addition of
              | CO2 negatively affects the MR performance. In particular, the !!"! decreased from
              | 37% to 34% using Mix 1 and Mix 2, respectively. Moreover, the HR decreases also
              | from 87% to 85%. However, the negative effect of CO2 on the reaction is balanced by
              | the membrane presence. In particular, the ability of the membrane to selectively
              | separate hydrogen from the reaction zone allows for the shift effect, which helps the
              | conversion of CH4 and a difference in methane conversion of just 3% in the case of
              | Mix 2. The lower HR of Mix 2 compared to Mix 1 can be attributed to a lower
              | methane conversion, which produces a lower H2 partial pressure within the retentate
              | stream of the MR, thus providing a smaller driving force across the membrane.

              | 
text          | Another important parameter affecting the MR performance is the GHSV. Therefore,
              | three different GHSVs were used, i.e., 4,400 h-1, 5,650 h-1, and 6,850 h-1, for
              | evaluating the impact on the MR. Figure 9.4 shows !!"! , HR, and HPP at three
              | different GHSVs. It is evident that a decrease in GHSV enhances CH4 conversion. The
              | reduction of this parameter leads to a higher residence time and thus, a higher contact
              | time with the catalyst, thereby promoting the conversion. In addition, the decrease in
              | GHSV also enhances hydrogen recovery. In particular, CH4 conversion and HR are
              | around 55% and 93% with GHSV = 4,400 h−1, whereas they drop to 35% and 85% at
              | 6,850 h-1. Also, as shown in Figure 9.4, the best value of the hydrogen permeate purity

text          | These experimental tests showed the feasibility of using an Al2O3-supported palladium

              | impact on the system when the addition of a product of the reaction, CO2, was part of
              | the feed. Unfortunately, the ideal selectivity of the membrane was low, i.e., !!!   !!   =<

text          | The results of the experimental tests described previously showed the performance of
              | the Pd-based membrane reactor (MR) under steam methane reforming (SMR) reaction
              | conditions. These tests served as a reasonable proxy for natural gas, given the main
              | component is typically methane, with a concentration > 80 vol.%; however, in order to
              | evaluate how the other hydrocarbon components present in natural gas impact
              | performance, the results of the experimental testing discussed in this chapter were
              | conducted using a ‘simulated’ mixture of natural gas containing C1-C4 hydrocarbons
              | and carbon dioxide.

text          | Although natural gas (NG) consists mostly of methane, the composition can vary
              | widely depending on the geologic reservoir from which it is recovered. Well location,
              | geological conditions, and extraction method can dictate the level of impurities, e.g.,
              | water, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide and higher-order hydrocarbons contained within the
              | natural gas. Once raw natural gas is processed (e.g., sulfur removal, etc.), it can enter
              | the pipeline distribution system followed by the consumption of the end-use product.
              | The natural gas consumed in the U.S. has a standard heating value of approximately
              | 1,000 BTU/ft3 (1,000 kJ/28L) at STP (Administration 2016). Hence, given the
              | standardization is a heating value and not gas composition, a compositional range of
              | gases, largely determined from a safety prospective by the Pipeline and Hazardous
              | Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) part of the U.S. Department of
              | Transportation, can be found within natural gas (Wang et al. 2014). The maximum

              | other hydrocarbons (HC) C2-C4 were fed into a fluidized-bed membrane reformer

              | conversion of 81%, with a decreased of H2 purity of 99.988% (Mahecha-Botero et al.
              | 2008). De Falco et al. (2011) used four different composite Pd–based membranes
              | (pure Pd and Pd-Ag) module for separating hydrogen after the SMR units. In
              | particular, two separation modules were used in their work. The first one was situated

              | ranging between 3.9 – 10.2 µm, to obtain a hydrogen yield of ~ 80% (Uemiya et al.
              | 2004). The aim of that research was to characterize the membrane performance based
              | on thickness and therefore reaction details are limited. Relating to ethane SR, no
              | studies were found in the open literature using a Pd-based membrane; however,
              | several studies exist relating to the dehydrogenation of ethane by using a Pd-based
              | membrane (Gobina et al. 1995, Gobina et al. 1995, Wang et al. 2003). Furthermore,
              | several studies were reported in the literature dealing with C2 – C4 reactions in MRs,
              | but they are all related to the dehydrogenation reaction and specific end-use

text          | Additionally, a complex network of side reactions within the MR can take place to
              | form various HC species with one example being propylene, which could take place
              | by way of desorption of dehydrogenated C3 carbon species during the SR process
              | (Rostrup-Nielsen et al. 1999, Kolb et al. 2004). Furthermore under SR conditions,
              | propane dehydrogenation was shown to only occur at a temperature higher than ~ 530
              | °C (Resini et al. 2005). Although coke was not detected after reaction testing in this

              | on the catalyst and/or membrane surface (García 2015).

text          | Another possible, but not probable reaction, that could have taken place is dry
              | reforming of CH4, which usually takes place at temperatures > 450 °C with modest
              | conversions (Swaan et al. 1994, Kikuchi 1995, Galuszka et al. 1998, Wang et al. 1998,
              | Paturzo et al. 2003, Abashar 2004) . Also, with excess amount of steam along with a
              | high partial pressure of hydrogen, and low operating temperature, the likelihood that
              | this reaction contributing to the overall hydrogen production was thought to be
              | minimal (Galuszka et al. 1998, Pakhare et al. 2014). With limited literature describing

              | MR at STP and catalyst volume), as well as long-term reaction testing on the MR
              | performance were all analyzed. In particular, a feed of methane versus NG was
              | compared under different reaction pressures, which varied between 100 to 300 kPa.
              | After this initial testing, the NG SR reaction was carried out in the Pd-Au MR to
              | investigate the effect of temperature (e.g., 350, 400 and 450 °C) along with varied
              | GHSV (e.g., 1,300, 2,600, 4,000, and 7,800 h-1) on the MR performance. In addition,
              | long-term reaction testing under fixed conditions was conducted for 10 days straight
              | (240 hours) to analyze if and how the MR performance changed. An argon sweep gas

              | Following this, hydrogen was supplied to the membrane and continuous permeation
              | flux measurements were taken. Once a steady hydrogen flux was achieved at 350 °C,
              | the temperature was increased to 400 °C and the permeation tests were repeated. This
              | procedure was carried out until a working temperature of 450 °C was reached. The
              | membrane was kept under 450 °C for 100 hours to ensure a steady state of the H2
              | permeating flux. Figure 10.3 shows the initial H2 permeate flow rate of DR1 as a

              | As can be seen, the initial H2 flow rate of the permeate stream at 450 °C was 100
              | mL/min and after 35 hours it increased to 136 mL/min. This increase in the hydrogen

text          | At 350 and 400 °C, the hydrogen permeation flux as a function of the difference in
              | partial pressure of hydrogen to the power of n is plotted and a linear regression
              | equation with associated R2 was used to calculate the value of n. The highest R2 was
              | found at an n value of 0.5 indicating that the diffusion of atomic hydrogen through the
              | dense metal layer is the rate-limiting step. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 10.4, at
              | 450 °C the best linear fit corresponding to the highest coefficient of determination, R2,
              | was found for n = 0.53. Therefore, at this temperature, the transport of hydrogen

              | mechanism through the bulk palladium phase.

text          | The higher conversion achieved by using pure methane probably is due to the presence
              | of other HC components. In particular, C2-C4 hydrocarbons can react to produce
              | methane (based upon Eq. 10.6, 10.7, 10.13, 10.16) and thus, modify its content in the
              | outlet stream of the MR. This leads to a lower estimate of the methane conversion
              | from the original feed when natural gas is fed into the MR. Moreover, as was shown in
              | Chapter 7 and Chapter 9, the presence of CO2 can affect the system by slightly
              | decreasing the conversion. Although the conversion of methane was lower at all tested
              | pressures, the amount of hydrogen produced was greater. Figure 10.7 and Figure 10.8
              | show the hydrogen recovery as well as the pure hydrogen flow rate coming from the
              | permeate stream.

text          | The higher hydrogen production can be attributed to the high conversion of propane,
              | butane and ethane at all pressures tested. Moreover, more hydrogen can be produced
              | per mole of hydrocarbon, C2-C4, than C1, i.e., methane. The conversion of each HC
              | can be found in Figure 10.9. As can be seen, the conversion of each HC increases with
              | increasing pressure. By considering that the increasing pressure produces two opposite
              | effects with the first one being negative and impacts the thermodynamics of the
              | reaction in that the complete HC reactions proceed with an increase in mole number.
              | Also, the second effect is positive and is due to the Pd–Au membrane resulting in a
              | higher hydrogen permeating flux. The overall increasing trend of the HC conversion
              | likely occurs because the membrane effect is greater than the thermodynamic effect.
              | The lowest and highest values of the conversion for each HC were: ethane, 89.5 –
              | 93%, propane, 88.5 – 92%, and butane, 76 – 83%.

text          | These high conversions suggest that more hydrogen is produced within the reactor,
              | thereby producing a higher hydrogen flux across the membrane, which increases the

text          | As the reaction pressure is increased, i.e., from 100 to 300 kPa, an increasing trend in
              | the formation of CO2 and a decreasing trend in formation of CO are found for both
              | methane and NG feeds. This is due to the increased hydrogen flux, as pressure is
              | increased, thus shifting the reactions towards their products that mostly consist of CO2
              | and H2. Also, NG SR compared to pure methane formed a higher amount of CO2 and a
              | lower amount of CO. This is due to the higher hydrogen production and its higher
              | permeation for the NG feed, thereby further shifting the reactions, in particular the
              | WGS, as compared to methane.

text          | These results indicate that by increasing temperature, the conversion of all the
              | hydrocarbons increases, due to the positive effect of a higher temperature on the MR
              | reaction system. More specifically, a higher temperature allows for a higher hydrogen
              | permeating flux (based upon Eq. 6.4), which enhances the HC conversion due to the
              | hydrogen removal through the Pd–Au membrane. This affects the HC reactions,
              | shifting the reactants toward further product formation thereby increasing HC
              | consumption. Moreover, the reactions are endothermic (Eq. 10.4, Eq. 10.9, Eq. 10.11,
              | and Eq. 10.17), and are favored at higher temperatures. More specifically, the increase
              | in conversion for methane was 19 %, while for ethane, propane, and butane the
              | conversions were 61 %, 55 %, and 13 %, respectively. Figure 10.13 shows the CO2
              | and CO flow rate of the NG SR reaction versus reaction temperature. As shown, the
              | production of both products increases with increasing temperature due to the higher

text          | increase with increasing temperature as demonstrated in Figure 10.14. This increase
              | can be attributed to the higher temperature, which results in a higher hydrogen
              | permeating flux (calculated from Eq 6.4) and a higher hydrogen stream recovered on
              | the permeate side. The HPP was calculated to be 100% at all the temperatures
              | considered, indicating that the H2 recovered from the permeate side can be feed
              | directly to a PEMFC or used for other applications in which high-purity H2 is required.

text          | Another important operating parameter studied was the GHSV. The experimental
              | testing conditions chosen and the subsequent results discussed in this section were
              | motivated by the best MR performances reported previously, i.e., reaction pressure of
              | 300 kPa, permeate pressure of 100 kPa, and T = 450 °C. Figure 10.15 shows the HC
              | conversion versus the GHSV. As can be seen, by increasing GHSV, the conversion of
              | each HC is decreased. This occurs since the higher GHSV leads to a lower residence
              | time, which subsequently leads to lower conversion.

text          | The decrease in methane conversion was 22.5%, while the decrease in ethane,
              | propane, and butane conversion was 78%, 73%, and 26%, respectively. In addition to
              | the HC conversions, Figure 10.18 and Figure 10.19 show the products of the reaction
              | as well as the HR and HPP versus GHSV. As can be seen from Figure 10.16, by
              | increasing the GHSV, the total hydrogen production is increased, whereas the HR
              | decreased. This is due to higher GHSVs corresponding to a higher reactant flow rate,
              | thereby leading to higher hydrogen production at a higher GHSV, despite the low HC
              | conversion. Moreover, the space velocity is too high and the surface area too low to
              | allow for the H2 permeation, which results in a hydrogen permeate flow rate almost
              | constant at each GHSV investigated. As a result, the HR decreases by increasing the
              | space velocity. In addition, the HPP was 100% throughout all of the experimental tests
              | performed with no detection of other species in the permeate stream.

text          | The hydrogen permeate flow rate through the Pd-Au membrane nearly doubled at 350

              | specifically, the permeate flow rate initially was 51 mL/min and after experimental
              | testing increased to 110 mL/min. This shows that the annealing of the initial bi-layer
              | alloy was not complete within the first 100 hours as originally hypothesized. This was
              | probably due to the low temperature since all of annealing temperatures are above 450
              | °C as reported in the literature. For example, Shi et al. (2010) showed that the
              | annealing of the Pd-Au membrane was mostly complete after 1 week at 600 °C under
              | hydrogen permeation, while Chen et al. (2010) confirmed that Pd-Au annealing was

              | found that after ~ 100 hours at 500 °C, the annealing of the top Pd-Au layer was
              | sufficient to warrant the added benefits of alloying with Au, i.e., higher permeability
              | and sulfur resistance (Gryaznov 2000). A photo showing DR1 before and after

blank         | 
              | 
text          | The results of this study have shown that the use of natural gas directly from the
              | pipeline for the purpose of producing pure hydrogen is attainable. Although the
              | conversion of methane was lower when using real natural gas as compared to pure
              | methane, the production of hydrogen was greater due to the high conversions of
              | ethane (93 %), propane (92%) and butane (83%). These results suggest that by using
              | the MR technology with a real natural gas mixture, high conversions and high
              | hydrogen recovery can be achieved at low operating temperatures (450 °C) and
              | pressures (300 kPa). This highlights the ability of the MR to produce hydrogen at mild
              | conditions with respect to a commercial hydrogen production process.
              | Further studies at 450 °C showed that the total production of hydrogen could be as
              | high as 185 mL/min for a GHSV of 7,800h-1 while obtaining an HPP of 100%. Further
              | testing showed an HR of 64% under a low operating temperature of 350 °C and a

text          | reaction pressure of 300 kPa. Long-term natural gas steam reforming reaction testing
              | concluded that the performance of the MR in terms of hydrocarbon conversion as well
              | as hydrogen recovery was stable for 240 hours. Throughout these experiments, the
              | total hydrogen produced was 75 mL/min, and a steady HR of 55% was obtained with
              | an HPP of 100%.

              | 
text          | Furthermore, the Pd-Au membrane showed stability in terms of ideal selectivity,
              | which was infinite at 350 and 400 °C, with an HPP of 100% for over long periods of
              | time, i.e., > 1,000 hours. This shows that by producing a bi-layer metallic membrane
              | through electroless plating of Pd and electroplating of Au, an established alloy is
              | achievable for its use under steam reforming reactions.

text          | One common impurity contained in natural gas (NG) is hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which
              | is commonly found in concentrations on the order of single percentages with some
              | wells producing greater than 10% (Ghosh et al. 1986, Hammer et al. 2006). Natural
              | gas containing greater than ~ 4 ppm of H2S by volume at STP is considered a sour gas
              | and less than 4 ppm is referred to as a sweet gas (Katz 1959). Sorbents (e.g., zinc
              | oxide) are a robust technology for NG desulfurization; however, some traces of H2S
              | on the order of a few ppm can still exit from the treatment unit (Rosso et al. 2003,

text          | The Environmental Pretention Agency’s (EPA) acceptable levels for total sulfur
              | contained in the pipeline, as found in the U.S. Federal Regulation 40CFR72.2, is 0.5
              | grain/100 ft3 or approximately 8 ppm. This total sulfur limit may be easily surpassed
              | with the addition of ~ 8 ppm mercaptan, a common odorizing compound added to
              | natural gas,] that contains sulfur, giving it its distinct smell (Jacobus et al. 1996,
              | Kidnay et al. 2011). One such example where the total sulfur content can exceed the
              | federal levels is under National Standard IEEE 1547 and the CA commission Rule 21,
              | which states that local utilities can supersede the federal ruling on the basis of bi-
              | directional power flow equipped with smart monitoring technologies (Basso et al.

              | within northern California, has the ability to set the total sulfur content to 1.0 grain/
              | 100 ft3 or 17 ppm, which is double that of the federal limit (Pacific Gas and Electic

              | Although it has been shown that if the ratio of H2S-to-H2 is lower than ~ 0.0011
              | (~1000ppm H2S-to-H2), pure Pd membranes show some resistance to H2S (Iyoha et al.
              | 2007), and so Pd alloys have been developed for further H2S resistance (Iyoha 2007).
              | In particular, the development of palladium membranes alloyed with, Cu, Ag, Au, Pt,
              | and Group III-V metals have allowed for membranes to be able to resist H2S
              | poisoning. However, although the H2S poisoning is mostly reversible and the original
              | H2 flux can be completely restored, the hydrogen flux through the membrane can
              | decrease by > 90% (Musket 1976, Sholl et al. 2006, Roa et al. 2009, Way et al. 2015).

text          | Additional concern for using pure Pd membranes is hydrogen embrittlement, which is
              | caused by the large distortion in the lattice structure due to the α−β phase
              | transformation at operating temperatures below ~ 300 °C (Hunter 1960, Grashoff et al.
              | 1983). When the cyclic stress is present by adsorption and desorption of hydrogen, the
              | palladium becomes very brittle. This mechanical instability is somewhat decreased by
              | making alloys with other metals such as Ag, Ru, Rh or other rare-earth elements. In
              | particular, the addition of Ag to Pd gives a high stabilizing effect thereby mitigating
              | the embrittlement phenomenon. Moreover, it has been shown that Pd/Ag with 20 to 25
              | wt.% silver allowed for achieving up to two times the hydrogen permeating flux
              | through the membrane when compared to pure Pd (Holleck 1970, Hwang et al. 1975,

text          | There are few studies that have tested and demonstrated the sulfur resistance of Pd/Ag

text          | Over the past few decades, different alloys such as Pd/Pt, Pd/Au, and Pd/Cu have been
              | studied for analyzing their resistance to H2S poisoning. Several studies have shown
              | that the addition of platinum to palladium improves the chemical stability in the
              | presence of sulfur compounds, i.e., H2S (Lewis et al. 2013). The ability for platinum to
              | resist sulfur poisoning has been shown with mixed results. For example, in order to
              | show the ability of platinum to resist H2S poisoning, some studies have used a Pt
              | membrane for the purpose of producing hydrogen and sulfur from H2S via thermolysis
              | (Raymont 1975, Chivers et al. 1980, Edlund et al. 1994). Edlund et. al. showed that a
              | platinum composite membrane can completely convert H2S into hydrogen and sulfur
              | while operating for more than eight hours (Edlund et al. 1993). Nevertheless, other
              | studies have shown that by using a flow containing 6,200 ppm of H2S, at T = 400 °C
              | for 60 minutes, that the hydrogen permeating flux through Pd-Pt membranes
              | decreased sharply followed by a slow recovery under hydrogen to the original
              | performance. (Yoshida et al. 1985, Kajiwara et al. 1999, Howard et al. 2008).

text          | Two other important Pd-based alloys that have shown to be resistant to H2S poisoning
              | are Pd/Au and Pd/Cu. Gade et al. have shown that by increasing the wt.% of Au in the
              | Pd alloy, the resistance to sulfur and carbon is improved (Gade et al. 2011). This
              | analysis showed that with 20 wt.% of Au, the flux of hydrogen through the membrane
              | decreases by only 40% under 20 ppm of H2S at a temperature of 400 °C. The Pd-Cu
              | membrane has shown to have strong resistance to H2S poisoning while being cheaper
              | than those previously discussed, i.e., Pt, Au and Ag (Kamakoti et al. 2005, Gharibi et
              | al. 2013). Significant literature has shown that a 40 wt.% alloy with Cu has the highest
              | hydrogen permeability of the Pd/Cu alloys (Kulprathipanja et al. 2005, Pomerantz
              | 2010). The ability for Pd/Cu to completely resist H2S up to 1,000 ppm for hundreds of

text          | The H2S interaction on the surface of a Pd-based membrane has been studied since the
              | 1960s with Hurlbert et al. who found a grey surface film on a dense pure Pd
              | membrane disk after H2S exposure, which was believed to be palladium sulfide
              | (Hurlbert et al. 1961). Building off of this work, Kajwara et al. found that pure Pd
              | exposed to H2S resulted in surface cracks, which were probably produced by the
              | structural stress due to the increased lattice constant of PdS (Kajiwara et al. 1999).
              | They repeated these tests using a pure Pt composite membrane and found that no
              | deformation occurred possibly relating to the similar lattice constant of Pt and PdS.
              | Further studies by Kulprathipanja et al. showed the effect of H2S on Pd and Pd-Cu and
              | concluded that the pitting and cracking of the membrane surface was due to the
              | growth of PdS, which lead to lattice expansion (Kulprathipanja et al. 2005).

              | permeability of palladium sulfide that grows on the Pd surface (O’Brien et al. 2011).
              | The formation of palladium sulfide is thought to take place as follows (Zubkov et al.

              | binding strength of H2S was found for Cu when compared to Pd and Nb. From the
              | previous work, there is a strong correlation between the inhibition of the hydrogen

text          | Prior to H2S exposure, the membrane was characterized by permeation measurements
              | using pure gases, such as H2 and N2 under a constant temperature of 400 °C. The
              | dense Pd/Ag membrane used within this work differs from the composite membranes
              | used prior as described in Chapters 6 – 10 in that it is completely self-supporting. For
              | the purpose of checking if the membrane is defect free and/or to ensure the silver
              | brazing allowed for a perfect seal between the permeate and retentate, a leak test using
              | pure gas was carried out. This took place by flowing pure nitrogen into the retentate
              | stream of the module under an elevated constant pressure 300 kPa while closing off
              | the permeate side. A pressure gauge installed on the permeate side of the membrane
              | allowed for the evaluation of the presence of leaks.

              | hours, 200 ppm of H2S was fed to the membrane module for 33 minutes to simulate a
              | high exposure event. It can be seen from Figure 11.5, during the time that the

              | increase after having stopped the H2S supply.

text          | In particular, the introduction to 200 ppm of H2S decreased the H2 flux instantly to
              | 70% of its initial value. After 33 minutes, the H2 flux was just 9.5% of the initial flux
              | and continued to decrease, reaching 5.4% after the H2S was turned off and only H2
              | was fed into the reactor before slowly increasing. As discussed in Section 11.1, one
              | possible mechanism for the decrease in the H2 flux could be related to the adsorption
              | of sulfur on the surface of the membrane thereby reducing the hydrogen permeating

text          | The increase in the H2 flux was fast during the first ~ 14 hours, with an increase in the
              | H2 flux to 50% of its original value in just 10 hours after the H2S exposure.
              | Nevertheless, the H2 permeating flux took another 250 h to reach its original value, as
              | illustrated in Figure 11.6, and the membrane is completely restored showing that the
              | negative effect of H2S on H2 permeating flux through Pd/Ag membrane is reversible.
              | This can be explained by the desorption of adsorbed sulfur on the membrane surface.
              | In particular, the gas-solid equilibrium was shifted once the H2S exposure stopped and
              | only H2 was supplied, inducing the full recovery of the hydrogen flux (Chen et al.
              | 2010). The varied desorption shown by the asymptotic trend, suggests that the
              | desorption rate of sulfur varied, possibly related to the different binding energies of
              | sulfur with Pd/Ag (Alfonso 2005). This similar trend in recovery was found in
              | previous studies for other Pd alloys as well (Pomerantz et al. 2009).

text          | After the H2 flux through the membrane reached steady state under a H2 flow rate of
              | 250 mL/min at the operating conditions of Δp = 200 kPa and T = 400 °C, another
              | exposure test of H2S took place for a total of 6 hours. This experiment was carried out
              | for the purpose of evaluating the long-term ability of the Pd/Ag membrane under 40
              | ppm H2S, which is approximately double the total allowable sulfur contained in
              | pipeline quality natural gas, i.e., ~17ppm, in northern California. Figure 11.7 shows
              | the exposure with 40 ppm H2S.

text          | Even though natural gas desulfurization technology is mature the total sulfur contained
              | within pipeline quality natural gas can still be on the order of ppm levels. By using
              | sulfur-resistant membranes for the purpose of hydrogen production from natural gas,
              | MR technology may be fully realized. This chapter showed the ability of a dense 150-
              | µm thick Pd/Ag membrane to completely recover from the exposure of hydrogen
              | sulfide at two different concentrations, i.e., 200 ppm and 40 ppm. These results allow
              | for an alternative use of pure Pd membranes, which are irreversibly poisoned by H2S.
              | Although the hydrogen flux decreased during exposure to H2S, its complete recovery
              | makes the use of Pd/Ag membranes feasible for the purpose of hydrogen production
              | from natural gas.

text          | Transportation is a vital component for maintaining a healthy economy. As nations are
              | becoming more developed, the wealth of the population increases, translating into
              | more miles traveled per person. Given the current infrastructure, the more miles that
              | are traveled, the more fossil fuels are consumed with subsequent GHG emissions. As
              | an example a simple calculation is reported in the following. Currently in the U.S.
              | there are 800 cars per 1000 people, which accounts for the largest fleet of automobiles
              | in the world (Cheah et al. 2008, Ramey et al. 2010). Now, take for example the two
              | most populated countries in the world, i.e., India and China. In India there are 20 cars
              | per 1000 people and in China 58 cars per 1000 people. If these countries were to
              | increase this ratio to half that of the U.S. per capita demand (i.e., 400 cars per 1000
              | people), this would increase the number of cars on the planet to two billion, doubling
              | the current estimate. In fact, this estimation is close to the projected amount of new
              | vehicles that will be on the roads by 2050 (Sperling et al. 2009). Furthermore, the
              | World Energy Council believes that along with a 51% growth in the number of
              | automobiles on the planet, the CO2 emissions will grow by 36% due to fuel switching
              | primarily from gasoline to biofuels and compressed natural gas. Mitigation of
              | emissions further requires a built infrastructure surrounding CO2 mitigating
              | technology, which on-board reforming via Pd-based MRs could have a part in.

text          | The newest addition to the fleet of hydrogen vehicles is the Toyota Mirai, which is
              | currently available for purchase within the U.S. and Japan. The fuel economy is ~ 67
              | miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe), taking into account that 1 kg of
              | hydrogen is approximately equal to 1 gallon of gasoline in terms of energy content.
              | The total range upon fueling with 5 kg of hydrogen is 312 miles with hydrogen being

text          | Using the values from the Toyota Mirai, ~ 1 kg of hydrogen is consumed for every 60

text          | Using the fuel economy of the Miari, ~ 1 kg/60 miles, and an average speed of 60
              | miles/hour, the required flow rate of hydrogen would be 1 kg/hour or 8.33 mol/min.
              | Using this flow rate, a total reactor volume along with the number of Ma-173 Pd
              | membranes needed can be estimated. The amount of hydrogen that can be produced
              | by the membrane at a constant temperature is related to the partial pressure of
              | hydrogen across the membrane, which can be calculated using Eq. 2.4. Therefore, as
              | the reaction pressure increases, so will the hydrogen permeate flow rate of the
              | membrane, as shown in Figure 12.2.

text          | The data points shown in Figure 12.3 are experimental values where the line

text          | Therefore, the total amount of space needed on-board the vehicle for the MR
              | technology is estimated to be ~ 0.12 m3, or about the same space required for
              | hydrogen storage on-board the Mirai. Additionally, 120 liters is about 30 gallons,
              | which is double the average gasoline fuel tank of a standard midsize vehicle.
              | These estimates indicate that the space needed on-board a vehicle to produce pure
              | hydrogen in real time for feeding a fuel cell are minimal. Further estimates on the

text          | Steam methane reforming (SMR) normally takes place in large processing plants with
              | high thermal efficiencies, as explained in Section 2.2 of Chapter 2. Several studies
              | have indicated that the energy efficiency of large-scale SMR plants is 80 – 85% based
              | on the higher heating value (HHV) of hydrogen produced divided by the HHV of
              | methane required as an input in addition to auxiliaries, i.e., pumping, processing, etc.
              | (Rase et al. 1977, Molburg et al. 2003, Simpson et al. 2007). The outlet of the
              | hydrogen from the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit is ~ 2 – 5 psig (Ruthven et al.
              | 1994), and therefore compression work is not part of the energy efficiency value cited.

text          | conversion efficiency of water to hydrogen (99.9- 99.9998%) is high, i.e., > 80% for

              | 73% (Ursua et al. 2012). The large spread in efficiencies can be attributed to system
              | design and final hydrogen pressure, which varies between ~ 5 bar to ~ 690 bar for
              | various commercial vendors (Ivy 2004).

              | 
text          | The ability of the MR to produce pure hydrogen from methane or natural gas has been
              | discussed in previous chapters, specifically Chapters 7, 9, and 10. Largely left out of
              | the conversion was MR technology energy efficiency and how it compares to
              | commercial hydrogen production operations. Only a few literature sources exist
              | showing the energy analysis of the MR technology (Shirasaki et al. 2009, Roses et al.
              | 2013). Roses et al. showed that for a pure hydrogen production rate of 50 m3/h (~
              | 4.5kg/h) within a MR system with a membrane area of 0.308 m2 operating at 600 °C,
              | S/C = 3.0/1, and reaction pressure of 25 bar, a total system efficiency of 80% was
              | obtained. This value also takes into account the compression energy needed to
              | compress the pure hydrogen within the permeate side from ~ 2 bar to 24 bar, which
              | matches the commercial PSA outlet pressure used for this study. Comparatively the
              | commercial SMR system modeled in this same study obtained a total efficiency of ~
              | 76%. Interestingly, the cost of hydrogen for the commercial SMR plant is less than the
              | MR case, $1.33/kg compared to $1.41kg, due to higher electrical consumption relating
              | to the compression of hydrogen to match the PSA outlet conditions. Further related to
              | the 10-year cost of the produced hydrogen, the MR compared to the commercial SMR
              | is estimated to be about $.10/kg cheaper related to the exclusion of the PSA system.
              | Total system efficiencies for both the commercial and MR systems have an outlet of >
              | 99.999% purity of hydrogen with a pressure of 24 bar; therefore, the compression
              | work for increasing the hydrogen pressure to 70 MPa, which is the typical pressure of

              | (Shirasaki et al. 1997, Shirasaki et al. 2009). Also shown for this technology was that

text          | The main aim of this work was to produce high-purity hydrogen, i.e., > 99.999%, for
              | fuel cell use on-board vehicles using natural gas steam reforming in Pd-based MRs.
              | The work involved tubular inorganic Pd-based composite MRs, personally fabricated,
              | in which steam reforming of methane and natural gas were carried out. The influence
              | of such operating conditions as reaction temperature and pressure, feed molar ratio,
              | space velocity, sweep gas flow rate on the MR performance was analyzed. Also, the
              | effect of different impurities commonly found within natural gas, i.e., nitrogen, carbon
              | dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide, on the performance of the MR system were also
              | investigated.

              | 
text          | Throughout the MR studies, it was shown that by using Pd-based MRs it was possible
              | to obtain higher hydrocarbon conversions than those obtained in FBR experiments,
              | while collecting a pure stream of hydrogen. As a first case study, the performance of a
              | composite Pd-based PSS-supported MR fabricated by electroless plating was
              | investigated through a series of experiments by performing the SMR reaction. In
              | particular, as a best result, the Pd/PSS MR was able to reach 84% of methane
              | conversion at preaction = 300 kPa, T = 400 °C, S/C = 3.5/1, GHSV = 2,600 h-1,pperm =
              | 100 kPa, and Ar sweep rate of 100 mL/min. This high conversion allowed for a
              | maximum hydrogen recovery of 82%, while maintaining a permeate hydrogen purity
              | of 100%.

text          | The operating pressure and temperature conditions used in this case study are
              | significantly lower than the current industrial processes, i.e., 1.5 – 2.0 MPa and > 800
              | °C, for producing hydrogen via SMR. To further emphasize the performance of the
              | MR, the SMR reaction tests at 400 °C were also investigated in an FBR configuration.
              | The outcome shows that the methane conversion is higher by 57% in the MR

              | Initially, the membrane showed a near-infinite selectivity towards hydrogen
              | permeation at pressures less than 100 kPa. After 750 experimental hours, the ideal
              | selectivity of hydrogen with respect to Ar dropped to 30. Nevertheless, no CO was
              | detected in the permeate stream for all of the experimental campaigns, which shows
              | that as the membrane slowly degraded, it had the ability to still produce CO-free
              | hydrogen for feeding a fuel cell or for other hydrogen-sourced applications. Moreover,
              | the use of steam as a permeate sweep gas has shown the ability of the MR system to
              | produce 100%-pure hydrogen stream. In addition, it was also shown that increasing
              | the sweep gas flow rate negated the effect of impurities such as nitrogen and CO2 on
              | the conversion and hydrogen production.

text          | As a second case study, real natural gas mixtures along with a Pd-Au/PSS MR were
              | investigated. During the testing the MR showed stable performance for over 240 hours
              | indicating that the Pd membrane and the catalyst could work for extended periods of
              | time. Over this time, > 90% conversion was experienced by propane, ethane, and
              | butane without noticeable decreases in performance and the Pd membrane showed
              | complete ideal selectivity of hydrogen with respect to the other gases. This indicates
              | that pure hydrogen can be constantly produced on-board a vehicle and can be fed
              | directly into a fuel cell without the use of hydrogen storage while obtaining a mostly
              | pure carbon dioxide by-product.

              | 
text          | As a third study, a commercial unsupported Pd/Ag membrane was used for analyzing
              | the effect of H2S on hydrogen permeation.         It was shown that by exposing the
              | membrane to H2S, the hydrogen permeation flux decreased. However, this decrease
              | was temporary and complete recovery was realized at 200 ppm and 40 ppm H2S
              | exposure tests showing no long-term effects on the membrane. In addition to the
              | analysis of the MR performance during the reaction and permeation testing, the
              | parameters of the catalyst were investigated to illustrate the potential use of the
              | commercial catalyst as a methane storage material. This work showed that the surface

text          | In summary, this work has dealt with the combination of two distinct areas of
              | engineering, i.e., catalysis and membrane technology. At a scientific level, it is
              | difficult to consider which of them is more prevailing in MR development.
              | Nevertheless, it is clear that natural gas may represent a key factor for hydrogen
              | production via the reforming reaction by MR technology, particularly to improve
              | hydrogen production. Rarely, in the open literature is this concept emphasized: while
              | natural gas is preferentially used for stationary applications, it is expected that it could
              | play a more important role in the future for non-stationary applications.

              | 
text          | Concerning the reforming reaction performed in MRs, a problem that affects several
              | studies present in the literature is the difficulty of directly comparing performance in
              | terms of conversion, hydrogen yield and hydrogen recovery since the experiments are
              | often carried out under differing conditions. Furthermore, there is a lack of
              | information regarding the cost analysis for MRs. This is because MR technology has
              | limitations to be overcome before application at larger scales.

              | 
text          | Future efforts should include the preparation of defect-free inorganic membranes that
              | work for long periods and under harsh operating conditions as well as to develop
              | membrane systems not based on palladium or with low palladium content. By solving
              | these problems (i.e., synthesis of defect-free, stable and impurity-resistant membranes,
              | no- and/or low-palladium-based membranes), the benefits resulting from the use of
              | MRs on an industrial scale rather than FBRs for performing reforming reactions to
              | produce hydrogen could become realistic.

text          | Although a significant amount of work was carried out throughout this study, which
              | answered several questions about natural gas steam reforming in membrane reactors
              | further questions arose throughout. In order to paint a complete picture of this project,
              | some shortcomings and future directions should be addressed. A complete list of
              | possible future directions associated with this work include:
              |    1) Relating to the MR system, several opportunities exist for further work in
              |        terms of packaging the overall system for more efficient conversion and
              |        hydrogen permeation. This can take place via catalyst placement with respect
              |        to the membrane surface to ensure that as the feed, i.e., natural gas, converts to
              |        hydrogen, the hydrogen is able to easily permeate through the membrane
              |        surface. Another opportunity is related to the geometry of the membrane, i.e.
              |        flat, which may provide added benefits to the overall system by way of
              |        increased hydrogen permeation.
              |    2) Reaction testing within the MR can be taken to another level by way of using a
              |        feed with real natural gas that includes hydrogen sulfide. This kind of work
              |        could be the first of its kind in the open literature and interesting results would
              |        come by way of understanding the conversion and hydrogen permeation
              |        dynamics of the system under various H2S concentrations.
              |    3) Continued research on the catalyst that can be used as both a methane storage
              |        material as well as a catalyst would provide the opportunity for a compact
              |        design for the on-board application. Catalyst characterization data during this
              |        work took place through the use of nitrogen and argon as probe gases for
              |        adsorption, but the potential for acquiring data relating to methane and carbon
              |        dioxide would provide further in-depth knowledge. Specifically, using carbon
              |        dioxide as an adsorptive gas would provide details about the pore sizes below 2
              |        nm.

text          |    4) Developing techniques for the fabrication of membranes for the specific end
              |        use of steam reforming could provide a more secure Pd layer, i.e., having
              |        chemical, mechanical and long-term stability. This would minimize the use of
              |        Pd while providing a membrane that could be used for long-term operation.
              |        Furthering this point, the fabrication of metallic alloys for enhanced hydrogen
              |        permeation and chemical resistance through improved material properties, such
              |        as higher permeability.
              |    5) Research into new materials selective to hydrogen permeation could lead to
              |        lower cost membranes while improving their hydrogen flux, sulfur resistance,
              |        and lifetime.
              |    6) Optimization modeling of the MR system as it relates to minimizing the energy
              |        and subsequent conversion efficiency of natural gas to hydrogen for
              |        transportation applications. In addition, determining the CO2 intensity of

              |        conventional methods, followed by compression and transportation to an
              |        energy station, from which the H2 would be sourced for on-board use.
