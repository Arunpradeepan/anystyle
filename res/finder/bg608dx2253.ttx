text          | Consumption of naturally occurring arsenic (As) in groundwater likely poses the greatest
              | threat to the most number of humans around the world today. Exposure to high As
              | concentrations, occasionally up to three orders of magnitude higher than the
              | recommended limit of 10 µg L-1 set by the World Health Organization, has lead to the
              | chronic poisoning of millions in South and Southeast Asia.
              |          Within soil environments, reducing conditions generally promote release of As
              | into the aqueous phase, while oxidizing conditions favor As immobilization. While many
              | past studies have examined and illustrated the role of reduction and oxidation processes
              | individually, there is currently a lack of information on competitive redox or coupled
              | processes that may occur within soils.      Furthermore, the combined effects of these
              | chemical processes in soils is complicated by the complex physical structure within
              | which these reactions take place. Accordingly, this dissertation focuses on defining the
              | competitive reactions controlling As transformation and partitioning within the physically
              | and chemically heterogeneous structure of soils.
              |          Within soils and sediments, redox gradients resulting from mass transfer
              | limitations lead to competitive reduction-oxidation reactions that drive the fate of As. In
              | Chapter 2, I investigated As reduction-oxidation dynamics in a diffusively-controlled
              | system using a Donnan reactor where birnessite and Shewanella sp. ANA-3 are isolated
              | by a semi-permeable membrane through which As migrates. Initially, As(III) is rapidly
              | oxidized to As(V) by birnessite; however, a rapid decline in the rate of As(III) oxidation
              | was observed owing to passivation of the birnessite surface. Modeling and experimental
              | results show that high [Mn(II)] combined with increasing [CO32-] from microbial
              | respiration leads to the precipitation of rhodochrosite, which eventually passivates the Mn
              | oxide surface, inhibiting further As(III) oxidation. These findings show that despite the
              | initial capacity of birnessite to rapidly oxidize As(III), the synergistic effect of intense
              | As(V) reduction by microorganisms and the buildup of reactive metabolites capable of

              | those based on thermodynamic predictions.
              |          Mass transfer limitations within soils also promote the formation of competitive
              | sorption interfaces, where As mobility can be affected by multiple sorbents. Manganese
              | and Fe oxides are ubiquitous solids in terrestrial systems that have high sorptive
              | capacities for As. Although numerous studies have characterized the effects of As
              | adsorption onto Fe and Mn oxides individually, the fate of As within mixed systems
              | representative of natural environments is unresolved. In Chapter 3, I examined As(III)
              | oxidation and competitive retention of As on goethite and birnessite by employing the
              | Donnan reactor. It was found that As(V) is preferentially partitioned onto goethite due to
              | higher sorption affinity compared to birnessite. Furthermore, reactive transport modeling
              | demonstrates that the amount of aqueous As available is controlled by the sorption
              | capacity of the goethite surface, which when saturated, leads to increased aqueous As
              | concentrations. These findings show that Mn oxides in soils act as a temporary sorbent
              | of As, but operate primarily as strong oxidants responsible for transformation of As(III)
              | to As(V), which can then strongly adsorb on, and is ultimately immobilized by, the
              | surrounding Fe oxide matrix.
              |          The aggregate-based structure of soils imparts physical heterogeneity that gives
              | rise to variation in microbial and chemical processes that may influence the speciation
              | and retention of As. To examine the impact of distributed redox conditions on the fate of
              | As in aggregated soils, I imposed various redox treatments upon constructed soil
              | aggregates composed of ferrihydrite- and birnessite-coated sands presorbed with As(V)
              | and inoculation with Shewanella sp. ANA-3. In Chapter 4, I reveal that diffusion-limited
              | transport allows reducing conditions to persist in the interior of the aggregate when
              | aerated treatments are imposed, causing As, Mn, and Fe to migrate from the reduced
              | aggregate interiors and become immobilized at the aerated exterior region.          Upon
              | transition to anoxic conditions, pulses of As, Mn and Fe are released into the advecting
              | solution outside of the aggregate.      These results demonstrate the importance of

              | dynamics, where redox transitions can either enhance or inhibit As release due to
              | speciation shifts in both sorbents and sorbates.
              |          The physical and chemical heterogeneity of soils is accompanied by the great
              | biological diversity that influences many of the chemical reactions controlling As
              | transformation. Extensive flooding during monsoon seasons in many regions of South
              | and Southeast Asia, such as Cambodia, creates anoxic soil conditions that favor anaerobic
              | microbial metabolic processes, including microbial As(V) respiration. Few studies have
              | successfully amplified arrA without prior enrichment and factors influencing sequence
              | diversity are currently unknown. In Chapter 5, amplification of a highly conserved
              | functional gene encoding dissimilatory As(V) reductase, arrA, was used as a molecular
              | marker to detect the genetic potential for As(V) respiration in environmental samples. I
              | demonstrated successful amplification, cloning, and sequencing of 223 novel arrA gene
              | sequences from Cambodia soils without prior enrichment/stimulation, collectively
              | forming a clade that is phylogenetically distinct from existing sequences available.
              | Application of permutational MANOVA demonstrates that As and depth variables are
              | most strongly associated with variations in arrA sequences. These findings demonstrate
              | the potential for using biogeochemically and ecologically relevant functional genes to
              | understand operative geochemical processes.
              |          In sum, strong oxidants of As, such as Mn oxides, may impede As transport by
              | transforming As(III) to the less mobile As(V) form; however, aqueous As concentrations
              | are ultimately controlled by the availability of Fe oxide sorption sites. Furthermore,
              | diffusion limited transport induces the formation of reducing centers within soil
              | aggregates even in the presence of oxygen. Reduced Fe that diffuses from the aggregate
              | interior forms a protective Fe oxide barrier upon contact with oxygenated advective flow
              | exterior of the aggregate, which adsorbs As from the interior, inhibiting its release to the
              | advecting solution. However, elimination of oxygen from the advecting solution causes a
              | pulse of As to be released upon reductive dissolution of the Fe oxide rind. Overall, the

text          | First and foremost I must thank Scott, who has not only been an exceptional PhD advisor,
              | but also an amazing mentor for many things in life. I always appreciated how Scott
              | placed so much of his effort into making our lives whole, recognizing that a student’s
              | productivity directly linked with our overall happiness. Whenever I doubted my own
              | abilities, Scott always had the right words to say and always went far and beyond to make
              | things work. Raising a baby during grad school can really turn your life upside down and
              | test all your limits, but Scott aided me in figuring out a brand new schedule to my day
              | along with revamping my emotional approach to life in general, which taught me how to
              | enjoy every moment with a perpetually positive attitude. I couldn’t be more grateful for
              | all the opportunities Scott has provided me over these phenomenally long seven years of
              | growth--he is a true inspiration.
              |          I must also thank my co-advisor Chris Francis and committee members Ali
              | Boehm and Chad Saltikov for their encouraging attitudes and continuous support. I also
              | thank my undergraduate advisor, Mike Goodchild for providing me guidance through
              | numerous internship opportunities, fostering my love for research, and eventually guiding
              | me toward my Stanford career.

title         | 1.1 History of Arsenic Exposure
text          |          Exposure to arsenic (As), a naturally occurring toxic metalloid, has lead to the
              | illness and death of millions of people over many centuries. Scheele’s green, a greenish
              | yellow pigment composed of cupric hydrogen arsenite, was invented in 1775 by Swedish
              | pharmaceutical chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and was used to pigment many everyday
              | household items including paints, food-dye, candle-wax, and fabric (1). Illness caused by
              | exposure to Scheele’s green through consumption or inhalation (as arsine gas, AsH3) and
              | its blackening when subjected to hydrogen sulfide eventually lead to its replacement with
              | cobalt green (1). Similarly, many other anthropogenic applications and activities have
              | lead to human exposure to toxic concentrations of As, including its use as an additive in
              | pesticides, herbicides, and feedstock (2), and its release during mining (3), metal smelting
              | (4), and coal combustion (5).      According to the Total Diet Market Basket Study
              | conducted by the FDA for the years 1991-1997, total daily intake of As in the U.S, is less
              | than 20 µg assuming consumption of 2000 mL of drinking water containing a maximum
              | of 5 µg L-1 of As and approximately 10 µg from food intake (6).
              |          Consumption of naturally occurring As in groundwater likely poses the greatest
              | threat to the most number of humans around the world today. Exposure to high As
              | concentrations, occasionally up to three orders of magnitude higher than the
              | recommended limit of 10 µg L-1 set by the World Health Organization (7), has lead to the
              | chronic poisoning of millions in South and Southeast Asia (8, 9), many of whom are
              | exhibiting a wide range of health problems including skin lesions due to
              | hyperpigmentation and hyperkertosis (10, 11) and terminal cancers (8, 12, 13).
title         | 1.2 Mechanisms of Arsenic Toxicity
text          |          Arsenic exists in both inorganic and organic forms with varying oxidation states
              | (-3, 0, +3, and +5), where As(III) compounds have more potent toxic properties than
              | those of As(V) compounds as determined by LD50 values of arsenicals in laboratory
              | animals (14). The lethal range of inorganic As for a human adult is estimated to be 1 to3
              | mg As kg-1 (15). In humans and many other mammals, As(V) is rapidly reduced to
              | As(III) in the liver by glutathione-S-transferase (16), which can occur non-enzymatically
              | in the presence of glutathione (GSH), followed by oxidative methylation to monomethyl
              | arsenic (MMA) or dimethyl arsenic (DMA) (17).
              |          Arsenic(III)   readily    reacts   with   thiol-containing    molecules     including
              | multifunctional enzymes which leads to the inhibition of key cellular functions.
              | Arsenic(III) has a high affinity for dithiols, such as lipoic acid, a cofactor required for the
              | enzymatic functioning of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDH is responsible for the
              | oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, the activated precursor for the citric acid cycle
              | where reducing equivalents (e.g. NADH) are produced to fuel the production of ATP
              | through electron transport.
              |          Arsenic(V) is a chemical analog of phosphate, having similar structure and
              | chemical properties, allowing As(V) to replace phosphate in many cellular processes.
              | For example, reaction of As(V) with glucose can form glucose-6-arsenate, in replacement
              | of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), as a substrate for G6P dehydrogenase which inhibits
              | hexokinase activity (required to direct glucose toward glycolysis or glycogenesis
              | pathways).    Aside from uncoupling glycolytic pathways, As(V) can also replace
              | phosphate during substrate level phosphorylation. ATP is formed during glycolysis in
              | the presence of phosphate, but not in the presence of arsenate (18).

title         | 1.3 Impact of Redox Processes on As mobility
text          |          The degree of As mobility in soils and sediments is governed, in large part, by
              | redox transformations of As and Fe species as seen in soils and sediments of South and
              | Southeast Asia. Cyclic redox conditions in Bangladesh and Cambodia have resulted in
meta          |                                                                                   2
text          | the release of As from surface sediments followed by eventual transport into aquifers
              | below (19, 20). Arsenic release from As-bearing sulfur minerals during rock weathering
              | leads to their repartitioning on Fe and Mn oxides.        After sediment transport and
              | deposition, the onset of reducing conditions with burial results in As release from the
              | oxides, with As, Fe, and Mn entering the aqueous phase. Once As partitions into the
              | aqueous, it is transported through sediments by a combination of advective flow paths
              | between aggregates and diffusion-dominated flow within aggregates. The remainder of
              | this chapter serves as an introduction to many biogeochemical mechanisms controlling
              | As mobilization in soils and sediments; in particular, oxidation and reduction processes
              | driven by biotic and abiotic forces, sorption mechanisms, and the physical heterogeneity
              | of soil.

title         | 1.4 Impact of As(V) and Fe(III) Reduction on Fate of As
text          |            Arsenic(III) and As(V) are the dominant As oxidation states in soils and
              | sediments, where As(V), typically present as HxAsO4x-3, adsorbs to a wide-range of
              | minerals including iron and aluminum (hydr)oxides and aluminosilicates minerals;
              | As(III), by contrast, is usually present as the neutral H3AsO3 species in non-sulfidic
              | environments and preferentially adsorbs to iron (hydr)oxides (21).
              |            Both As(V) and As(III) are able to adsorb strongly onto Fe oxides (here
              | collectively referring to oxyhydroxides, hydroxides, and oxides), forming bidentate-
              | binuclear, inner-sphere complexes (22). Sorption processes of As on Fe oxides control
              | the availability of As in many environments including acid mine drainage, marine
              | systems, and sediments (2). The effectiveness of Fe oxides for As sorption has been
              | applied in adsorptive treatment and development of other As remediation technologies
              | used in water treatment processes (23-25). Although Fe oxides are effective adsorbents
              | of As, labile, outer-sphere complexes may comprise a large portion of surface population
              | (26-28), which can be mobilized under flow conditions.          Arsenic(III) binds more
              | extensively on Fe oxide surfaces than As(V), but is more weakly bound compared to

              | 31).
              |          Reduction of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides can also lead to As mobilization through
              | reductive dissolution and mineral transformation. Transformation of ferrihydrite, a poorly
              | crystalline Fe(III) oxide with high surface area and sorption capacity for both As(V) and
              | As(III), to secondary minerals with lower surface area, such as magnetite and goethite
              | (32), can lead to desorption (33). However, the effects of Fe oxide transformation under
              | reducing conditions is complex and does not result in As release exclusively.
              | Interestingly, secondary precipitation of magnetite during microbial respiration of
              | ferrihydrite has been shown to temporarily sequester As(III) (29), followed by gradual
              | release as Fe oxide transformation ceases and reductive dissolution proceeds (34).
              |          To elucidate the mechanisms involved in this dual stage process the relative role
              | of As(V) and Fe(III) oxide reduction in As desorption under hydrodynamic conditions
              | was characterized by inoculating Shewanella sp. ANA-3, a well-characterized model
              | As(V)-respiring bacterium isolated from Eel Pond in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, (8)
              | capable of Fe(III) and As(V) reduction, in columns containing ferrihydrite- or hematite-
              | coated sands presorbed with As(V). Furthermore, mutant strains of Shewanella sp.
              | ANA-3 incapable of As(V) reduction or Fe(III) reduction were used to isolate the relative
              | effect of the two processes. The greatest amount of As was desorbed in the absence of
              | Fe(III) reduction, where formation of magnetite was inhibited, preventing sequestration
              | of As(III), while both Fe(III) reduction only and Fe(III)/As(V) reduction treatments
              | resulted in temporary As immobilization. Masue-Slowey et al. (35) observed similar As
              | sequestration effects within the anaerobic center of synthetic aggregates composed of
              | As(V)-sorbed ferrihydrite coated sands and As(V)-reducing bacteria under aerated
              | treatment.

              | or As(V) respiration under anaerobic conditions. Arsenic detoxification in bacteria is
              | mediated by the ars system, which has been thoroughly characterized in E. coli.
              | Arsenic(V) is taken up through phosphate transporters (e.g. Pit system) (37) while As(III)
              | uptake is likely mediated by GlpF, a glycerol facilitator in the aquaporin superfamily (38)
              | which may mistake As(OH)3 as an inorganic equivalent of glycerol. Arsenic(V) uptake is
              | followed by reduction to As(III) by arsenate reductase, ArsC, encoded by arsC gene, the
              | homolog of which is found in many bacteria. Arsenic(V) is reduced in a two-step process
              | by glutaredoxin and GSH, producing an As(III) intermediate bound to a cysteine residue
              | that is hydrolyzed to release As(III). Arsenic(III) produced from the reduction of As(V)
              | by ArsC or by uptake through aquaporins is removed from the cytosol through either an
              | arsenite carrier protein or an arsenite-translocation ATPase (39). In most bacteria, an
              | ATPase encoded by arsA is coupled with a cytoplasmic membrane efflux pump, ArsB.
              | Regulation of the ars operon is facilitated by ArsR and ArsD, which controls the basal
              | level (Kd of 0.33 µM As(III)) and the maximal level (Kd of 60 µM As(III)) of operon
              | expression, respectively (40), to prevent overexpression of ArsB.
              |          Under anaerobic conditions, microorganisms can couple the oxidation of a wide-
              | range of organic compounds (e.g. H2, lactate, acetate), to the reduction of As(V) during
              | respiration. Dissimilatory As(V)-reducing prokaryotes (DARPs) have been isolated from
              | a wide-range of environments (41) and are physiologically and phylogenetically diverse
              | with representatives from !-, "-, and #-Proteobacteria, low G+C gram positive bacteria
              | (Firmicutes), Eubacteria, and Crenarchaea (41)
              |          Although the ability to respire upon As(V) is wide-spread among many phyla,
              | no obligate As(V)-reducing microorganisms have been isolated, and instead, many are
              | capable of respiring upon a large spectrum of terminal electron acceptors such as Mn(IV),
              | Fe(III), Se(V), SO42-, and NO3-. Whereas the ars system is expressed under both aerobic
              | and anaerobic conditions, the arr operon that encodes proteins necessary for As(V)
              | respiration is expressed only under anaerobic conditions (42). Both systems are induced
              | by As(III); however, the arr system is activated at much lower concentrations (>100 nM)
              | than ars system (>100 µM) (42). The arr operon encodes for ArrA, a molybdenum-

text          | containing enzyme and ArrB, an enzyme containing Fe-S clusters, both resembling
              | proteins within the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase family (43). Arsenic(V) first
              | binds to ArrA in the periplasm, and is then reduced to As(III) with electrons delivered by
              | ArrB provided by c-type cytochromes during electron transport (43).
              |          The arrA gene is well conserved among phylogenetically diverse As(V)-
              | respiring bacterial isolates, making it possible to design primers to probe for arrA
              | presence using PCR methods (44-49). Divergences in the arrA sequences from different
              | locations may be inferred as variations in functionality between environments; hence,
              | specific environmental conditions may house a distinct clade of As(V)-respiring microbes

              | between the two environments or the existence of unique populations of dissimilatory

title         | 1.6 Arsenic(III) oxidation
text          |          While reductive processes promote As desorption, oxidative processes can
              | immobilize As correspondingly through sorption on oxide surfaces formed via oxidative
              | precipitation of Fe(II) and Mn(II), and oxidation of As(III) to the more strongly sorbing,
              | less toxic As(V) form. Arsenic(III) oxidation can be catalyzed enzymatically by both
              | heterotrophic and chemoautotrophic microbes as a detoxification mechanism (50) and for
              | growth, (51), respectively. Additionally, As oxidation can also proceed chemically
              | through electron transfer to Mn oxides (52-55). Oxidation of Mn(II) released from the
              | weathering of igneous and metamorphic rocks produces a variety of Mn(III), Mn(IV),
              | and mixed valence Mn oxides in the environment that thus may contribute to the abiotic
              | oxidation of As in soils and sediments.
              |          Whereas abiotic oxidation of Fe(II) is rapid in the presence of oxygen at pH $ 4,
              | Mn(II) is kinetically stabilized toward oxidation at circumneutral pH, and oxidation by
              | molecular oxygen requires mineral surface or bacterial catalysis (56). Phylogenetically
              | diverse Mn(II)-oxidizing microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, have been
              | cultured from a wide-range of environments (57). Although this metabolic capability
              | appears to be widespread, its function is currently unknown. Direct bacterial Mn(II)
              | oxidation is catalyzed enzymatically, while indirect biological oxidation is driven by non-
              | enzymatic processes (for example, the oxidation of Mn(II) by metabolic by-products). A
              | large body of information available regarding biological Mn(II) oxidation is based on

              |          Synthetic and bacterially produced Mn oxides have been used as effective
              | oxidants and sorbents in water treatment (59). Manganese oxides are strong oxidants of

              | molecules.    Many studies examining As cycling and sorption processes in soils have
              | focused primarily on interactions with Fe(III) oxides because of their greater abundance
              | (63) and high affinity for As; however, Fe(III) oxides cannot readily oxidize As(III) (53).
              | Removal of Mn oxides from lake sediments using hydroxylamine hydrochloride or
              | sodium acetate has been shown to decrease As(III) oxidation appreciably (53, 54, 64)
              | demonstrating their role as a primary oxidant in a range of natural systems.

title         | 1.7 Arsenic sorption dynamics in soil environments
text          |          Within soils and sediments, various sorbents of As coexist, leading to
              | competitive adsorption reactions. Application of extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS)
              | spectroscopy revealed that As(V) forms bidentate-binuclear complexes on both goethite
              | and birnessite (22, 52), providing evidence that the two oxides may have competing roles
              | for As retention in soils. Although numerous past studies have characterized the effects
              | of As adsorption onto Fe and Mn oxides individually (33-35, 52, 67, 68), whether
              | preferential adsorption of As onto one oxide over another will occur remains unclear.
              |          Aqueous As concentrations are often correlated with Fe(II) rather than Mn(II)
              | (69-71), suggesting that Fe oxides are the primary adsorbent of As. However, there is
              | evidence that As uptake by soils and sediments is enhanced in the presence of Mn oxides
              | (72-74). Also, removal of Mn oxides within an Fe-Mn binary-oxide adsorbent developed
              | for remediation of As lead to appreciably lower As(III) uptake by the adsorbent (75).
              | Sun et al. (76) examined As adsorption in soils containing ferromanganese nodules/Fe-
              | Mn oxide mixtures reporting As(III) was oxidized and then adsorbed onto the Fe-Mn
              | mixed oxide; however, it was not possible to quantify and compare the amount of As
              | adsorbed on the individual oxide phases. Futhermore, the extent and magnitude of
              | adsorption can vary depending on oxide type, and the variation in surface coverage will
              | lead to varying desorption rates.     Tufano and Fendorf (77) demonstrated that the
              | magnitude of As desorbed from iron (hydr)oxide coated sands varied over time and initial
              | As loading, providing evidence for the existence of multiple adsorption sites of varying

              | organic matter into macroaggregates (78, 79), which form a complex matrix of transport
              | mechanisms comprised of advective flow channels between aggregates combined with
              | diffusion-controlled intra-aggregate transport (80-82).    The rate of intra-aggregate
              | transport of chemical species such as oxygen from the aggregate exterior decreases
              | toward the aggregate center due to diminishing pore size, increased tortuosity, and
              | discontinuities (82).
              |             Oxygen is further limited within aggregates through microbial respiration,
              | becoming depleted within millimeters of the aggregate exterior (35, 83). Depletion of
              | oxygen initiates microbial anaerobic respiration alternative terminal electron acceptors,
              | including As(V) and Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides common to soil aggregates (84). In
              | many environments, including seasonally saturated soils (85), bioturbated sediments (86),
              | and forest soils (87), temporary O2 depletion within soil aggregates results from redox
              | fluctuations (83, 88), where rapid switches in dominant metabolic processes may occur
              | (86).
              |             The overall rate of reaction within a wide range of physical system depends
              | upon the competition between chemical reactivity and diffusive transport of reactants.
              | Reaction-diffusion processes have been examined for many decades in a wide-range of
              | disciplines from chemical engineering (89, 90) to medical sciences (91), where accurate
              | depiction of overall reaction rate requires a comparison of chemical kinetics and mass-
              | transfer limitations. Similarly, the rate of chemical reactions within soils is greatly
              | influenced by the availability of reactants within a physically heterogeneous matrix
              | containing diffusion-controlled transport of species into soil aggregates. Thus, accurate
              | characterization and quantification of overall chemical transformations within soils

text          |          Although past studies have examined and illustrated the role of reduction and
              | oxidation processes individually, there is currently a lack of information on competitive
              | redox or coupled processes that may occur within soils. Similarly, the retention of As in
              | soil matrices is affected by competitive adsorption reactions onto multiple sorption
              | surfaces. Furthermore, the combined effects of these chemical processes in soils is
              | complicated by the complex physical structure within which these reactions take place.
              | In addition, the microbial community responsible for As(V) reduction, a driving factor of
              | As release in soil environments, has only been briefly explored in disparate locations, and
              | is currently unknown in many parts of south and southeast Asia. Accordingly, this
              | dissertation aims to decipher the competitive reactions controlling As transformation and
              | partitioning within the physically and chemically heterogeneous structure of soils.

text          |          In Chapter 2, I investigate the competitive redox processes controlling As
              | oxidation and reduction at the interface of Mn oxides and dissimilatory As(V)-reducing
              | bacteria (DARB); in Chapter 3 I then examine the competitive retention and oxidation of
              | As(III) on Mn and Fe oxides under anoxic conditions. In Chapter 4, I examine the
              | combined As redox and sorption processes explored in Chapter 2 and 3 in a single,
              | physically heterogeneous context of a soil aggregate under various aeration treatments.
              | Finally, in Chapter 5, I survey the diversity and community structure of dissimilatory
              | As(V)-reducing bacteria in near-surface sediments of the Mekong Delta in Cambodia,
              | where porewater and groundwater concentrations of As can be orders of magnitude
              | greater than the suggested limit for drinking water. Furthermore, I determined whether
              | porewater concentrations of chemical constituents, including As, Fe, and Mn, directly
              | impact the community structure of As(V)-reducing bacteria.

text          | Within soils and sediments, redox gradients resulting from mass transfer limitations lead
              | to competitive reduction-oxidation reactions that drive the fate of As. Accordingly, the
              | objective of this study was to determine the redox cycling of As at the interface of
              | birnessite (a strong oxidant in soil with a nominal formula of MnOx, where x % 2) and
              | dissimilatory As(V)-reducing bacteria (strong reductant). Here, we investigate As
              | reduction-oxidation dynamics in a diffusively controlled system using a Donnan reactor
              | where birnessite and Shewanella sp. ANA-3 are isolated by a semi- permeable membrane
              | through which As migrates. Arsenic(III) injected into the reaction cell containing
              | birnessite is rapidly oxidized to As(V). Arsenic(V) diffusing into the Shewanella chamber
              | is then reduced to As(III), which subsequently diffuses back to the birnessite chamber,
              | undergoing oxidation, and establishing a continuous cycling of As. However, we observe
              | a rapid decline in the rate of As(III) oxidation owing to passivation of the birnessite
              | surface. Modeling and experimental results show that high [Mn(II)] combined with
              | increasing [CO32-] from microbial respiration leads to the precipitation of rhodochrosite,
              | which eventually passivates the Mn oxide surface, inhibiting further As(III) oxidation.
              | Our results show that despite the initial capacity of birnessite to rapidly oxidize As(III),
              | the synergistic effect of intense As(V) reduction by microorganisms and the buildup of
              | reactive metabolites capable of passivating reactive mineral surfaces—here, birnessite—

text          | Manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) oxides are ubiquitous solids in terrestrial systems that
              | have high sorptive capacities for many trace metals, including arsenic (As). Although
              | numerous studies have characterized the effects of As adsorption onto Fe and Mn oxides
              | individually, the fate of arsenic within mixed systems representative of natural
              | environments is unresolved.      Here, we examine As(III) oxidation and competitive
              | retention of As on goethite and birnessite using a Donnan reactor, where each oxide is
              | isolated by a semi-permeable membrane through which arsenic can migrate. To initiate
              | the Donnan reactor experiments, As(III) is simultaneously added to both chambers.
              | Arsenic(III) injected into the birnessite chamber is rapidly oxidized to As(V) and then
              | slowly redistributes across both chambers, while that added to the goethite chamber
              | undergoes rapid adsorption; As(III) on goethite undergoes desorption and diffusion into
              | the birnessite chamber and subsequent oxidation to As(V). With increased reaction time,
              | As(V) is generated and preferentially partitioned onto goethite due to higher sorption
              | affinity compared to birnessite. Furthermore, reactive transport modeling demonstrates
              | that the amount of aqueous As available is controlled by the sorption capacity of the
              | goethite surface, which when saturated, leads to increased aqueous As concentrations.
              | Our findings show that Mn oxides in soils act as a temporary sorbent of As, but operate
              | primarily as strong oxidants responsible for transformation of As(III) to As(V), which
              | can then strongly adsorb on, and is ultimately immobilized by, the surrounding Fe oxide

              | conditions on the fate of As in soils systems, we imposed various redox treatments upon
              | constructed soil aggregates composed of ferrihydrite- and birnessite-coated sands
              | presorbed with As(V) and inoculation with the dissimilatory metal reducing bacterium
              | Shewanella sp. ANA-3. Aeration of the advecting solution surrounding the aggregates
              | was varied to simulate environmental conditions. We find that diffusion-limited transport
              | allows reducing conditions to persist in the interior of the aggregate when aerated
              | treatments are imposed, causing As, Mn, and Fe to migrate from the reduced aggregate
              | interiors and become immobilized at the aerated exterior region. Upon transition to
              | anoxic conditions, pulses of As, Mn and Fe are released into the advecting solution
              | outside of the aggregate in order of energetic yield coupled with lactate oxidation during
              | microbial respiration. Inversely, release of reduced species from the aggregate into the
              | advecting solution is inhibited upon transition from aerated to anoxic conditions, where
              | the oxidized exterior acts as an oxidizing adsorbent barrier. Importantly, we find that
              | As(III) oxidation by birnessite is appreciable only in the presence of O2, where reductive
              | dissolution of Mn oxides inhibits oxidation under anaerobic conditions. Our results
              | demonstrate the importance of considering redox conditions and the physical complexity
              | of soils in determining the As dynamics, where redox transitions can either enhance or
              | inhibit As release due to speciation shifts in both sorbents (solubilization versus
              | precipitation of Fe and Mn oxides) and sorbates.

text          | Arsenic (As) cycling within soils and sediments of the Mekong Delta of Cambodia is
              | strongly affected by drastic redox fluctuations caused by seasonal monsoons. Repeated
              | oxidation and reduction of soils, which contain 10-40 mg kg-1 As, lead to the eventual

text          | monsoon seasons creates anoxic soil conditions that favor anaerobic microbial metabolic
              | processes, including arsenate (As(V)) respiration–a process contributing to the
              | mobilization of As.   Amplification of a highly conserved functional gene encoding
              | dissimilatory As(V) reductase, arrA, can be used as a molecular marker to detect the
              | genetic potential for As(V) respiration in environmental samples. However, few studies
              | have successfully amplified arrA without prior enrichment, and factors influencing
              | sequence diversity are currently unknown.       In the present study, we examine the
              | distribution and diversity of arrA genes amplified from multiple study sites within the
              | Mekong Delta at various soil depths (10, 50, 100, 200, and 400 cm). Additionally, results
              | from geochemical analysis of soil porewater collected using lysimeters at the
              | corresponding depths were applied in multivariate analysis to determine whether
              | variations in arrA sequence could be explained by environmental factors. Here we report
              | successful amplification, cloning, and sequencing of 223 novel arrA gene sequences from
              | Cambodia soils without prior enrichment/stimulation, collectively forming a clade that is
              | phylogenetically distinct from existing sequences in the database.       Application of
              | permutational MANOVA demonstrates that As and depth variables are most strongly
              | associated with variations in arrA sequences, whereas a number of other porewater
              | constituents (including Fe) appeared insignificant.      Our findings demonstrate the
              | potential for using biogeochemically and ecologically relevant functional genes to
              | understand operative geochemical processes and, in particular, conditions promoting the
              | mobilization of arsenic within flooded, tropical soils—systems where arsenic is having a
              | devastating impact on human health by contaminating regional aquifers.

title         | 2.1 Abstract
text          | The speciation and partitioning of arsenic (As) in surface and subsurface environments is
              | controlled, in part, by redox processes. Within soils and sediments, redox gradients
              | resulting from mass transfer limitations lead to competitive reduction-oxidation reactions
              | that drive the fate of As. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to determine the
              | fate and redox cycling of As at the interface of birnessite (a strong oxidant in soil with a
              | nominal formula of MnOx, where x % 2) and dissimilatory As(V)-reducing bacteria
              | (strong reductant).    Here, we investigate As reduction-oxidation dynamics in a
              | diffusively-controlled system using a Donnan reactor where birnessite and Shewanella
              | sp. ANA-3, are isolated by a semi-permeable membrane through which As migrates.
              | Arsenic(III) injected into the reaction cell containing birnessite is rapidly oxidized to
              | As(V). Arsenic(V) diffusing into the Shewanella chamber is then reduced to As(III),
              | which subsequently diffuses back to the birnessite chamber, undergoing oxidation, and
              | establishing a continuous cycling of As. However, we observe a rapid decline in the rate
              | of As(III) oxidation owing to passivation of the birnessite surface.        Modeling and
              | experimental results show that high [Mn(II)] combined with increasing [CO32-] from
              | microbial respiration leads to the precipitation of rhodochrosite, which eventually
              | passivates the Mn oxide surface, inhibiting further As(III) oxidation. Our results show

title         | 2.2 Introduction
text          |          Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid that can cause human health problems such as
              | cancer, and eventually death, when consumed chronically. The risk of As exposure,
              | along with its transport, is highly dependent on its oxidation state. Within soils and
              | sediments, As typically resides in the trivalent state as the arsenite oxyanion (HxAsO3x-3),
              | which is more common in reducing environments, or the pentavalent state as the arsenate
              | oxyanion (HxAsO4x-3) which typically dominates under oxidizing conditions. Arsenic(V)
              | adsorbs on a range of soil/sediment minerals, with a particular affinity for oxides (used
              | here to collectively refer to hydroxides, oxyhydroxides, and oxides) of iron, aluminum,
              | and manganese (1, 2). In contrast, As(III) binds preferentially to iron oxides (3) and,
              | despite having a greater adsorption maxima at neutral to high pH values (1) it is generally
              | more mobile than As(V) (4).
              |          Arsenic(V) retained on the solid phase may be desorbed through biological
              | reduction of the adsorbing material, such as microbial respiration on iron (5) or
              | manganese oxides (6), or through direct As(V) reduction (5)–the latter resulting from
              | microbial respiration or metal detoxification (7). Microbes capable of respiring As(V)
              | are phylogenically diverse, including members of Proteobacteria and Crenarcheota, and
              | have been cultured from a diverse range of environments (8); they couple the oxidation of
              | organic compounds (e.g. acetate, lactate, and formate), or inorganic compounds (e.g. H2,
              | sulfide), with the reduction of As(V) (8). Detoxification of As is also widespread among
              | many microbial phyla and has been studied in great detail (see (7) and references
              | therein), where As(V) is reduced to As(III) by the protein ArsC in the cytoplasm and the
              | reduced product is then expelled out of the cell through an efflux pump composed of
              | proteins ArsA and ArsB. The oxidation of As(III) to As(V) can occur in soils under
meta          | 24
text          | aerobic conditions, decreasing the concentration of dissolved As(III) and increasing the
              | extent of adsorption. Furthermore, As oxidation by oxygen is kinetically slow with a
              | reported half-life of one year (9), and no As(III) oxidation was observed even after 37
              | days of incubation in demineralized water (10). Arsenic(III) oxidation can be catalyzed
              | enzymatically by both heterotrophic and chemoautotrophic microbes as a detoxification
              | mechanism (11) and for growth (12), respectively. Additionally, As oxidation can also
              | proceed chemically through electron transfer to Mn oxides (2, 13, 14). In terrestrial
              | environments, Mn oxides compose a smaller fraction of total mass than Fe oxides (15),
              | but have the capacity to oxidize As(III) to the less toxic and less mobile As(V) state (13,
              | 16), as shown by studies using natural samples containing Mn oxides from lakes (13),
              | soils (17), and aquifer materials (18).
              |          Soils and sediments are composed of a complex network of pores, which often
              | lead to diffusion-limited mass transport into soil aggregates and large variation in redox
              | conditions resulting from differing microbial respiration processes; anaerobic processes
              | may occur within microns of aerobic zones within soils and sediments (19-21) (Figure
              | 2.1A). As a consequence, oxidants of As(III) such as Mn oxides may reside in close
              | proximity to reductants, produced microbially or chemically, leading to a tight redox
              | cycle that will control the fate and transport of As.

text          |          Although past studies have illustrated the processes involved in As oxidation
              | and reduction individually, there is currently a lack of information on competitive or
              | coupled redox processes that may occur within soils.             Furthermore, the impact of
              | microbial metabolic products on birnessite reactivity has not been well described. Fischer
              | et al. (22) demonstrated rhodochrosite precipitation can occur during microbial reduction
              | of birnessite when coupled with the oxidation of formate. Additionally, rhodochrosite
              | formation has also been speculated as the reason for the poor correlation of As and Mn in
              | various environments (23, 24), However, the impact of potential metabolic (or reaction)
meta          | 26
text          | products such rhodochrosite formation on arsenic cycling remains unresolved,
              | particularly within complex physical assemblages such as soils and sediments.
              | Accordingly, the objective of this study was to determine the fate and redox cycling of As
              | at the interface of Mn oxides and dissimilatory As(V)-reducing bacteria. To meet this
              | objective, we employed a modified Donnan reactor which allows the oxidative power of
              | a Mn oxide, birnessite, to be proximal to As(V)-reducing bacteria, Shewanella sp. ANA-
              | 3. Arsenic(III) was injected into the reactor, where Shewanella sp. ANA-3 and birnessite
              | were placed in neighboring reaction chambers separated by a permeable membrane. We
              | then followed the changes in dissolved As and Mn species as a function of reaction time.
              | Arsenic(III) within the birnessite chamber is rapidly oxidized to As(V) during the initial
              | phase of the experiment while the rate of reduction within the Shewanella sp. ANA-3 cell
              | always exceeds the rate of As(V) diffusion, resulting in As(III) being the sole form of As
              | in the reduction chamber. As the reaction progresses, the oxidative capacity of the
              | birnessite diminishes as a consequence of MnCO3 heterogeneous precipitation, resulting

              | Shewanella sp. ANA-3 (SHEW chamber) or the As(III) oxidizing mineral, birnessite
              | (BIRN chamber), which were separated by a semi-permeable membrane. Within the
              | BIRN chamber, As(III) was quickly oxidized to As(V), with As(V)aq concentrations
              | increasing to 207 µM at 0.7 h and reaching a maximum concentration of 310 µM at 16 h

              | rapidly to 100 µM by 0.7 h. In contrast, As(III) dominates the aqueous speciation
              | throughout the experiment within the Shewanella chamber, with As(V) concentrations
              | remaining nearly undetectable (Figure 2.3B).      Total aqueous As in both chambers
              | decreased over time reflecting an increase in As sorption within the BIRN chamber
              | (Figure 2.3A and 2.3B). Acid digestion of Shewanella sp. ANA-3 slurries showed no
              | significant adsorption of As onto the bacteria at any time during the experiment (data not
              | shown). XANES spectroscopic analysis showed that all of the adsorbed As on birnessite

text          |          The rate of As oxidation and reduction within the BIRN chamber appears to
              | have 3 dominant temporal phases (Figure 2.3A); all three periods are reasonably
              | described with first-order kinetics. From 0 to 0.7 h, [As(III)]aq decreases rapidly, with
              | commensurate increases in [As(V)]aq, yielding a first-order As(III) oxidation rate constant
              | of 3.9 h-1. The oxidation rate decreases by 65-fold during the second phase of 1 to 8 h of
              | reaction, with a rate constant of 0.06 h-1, resulting from the onset of birnessite
              | transformation and an apparent surface passivation. In the final phase (16 to 132 h),
              | [As(III)]aq concentrations increase (rather than decrease), albeit at a slow rate, giving a
              | first-order rate constant of -0.02 h-1. During this reaction period, As(V) reduction rate by
              | Shewanella sp. ANA-3 dominates over the rate of As(III) oxidation by birnessite.
              | Manganese(II) concentrations did not follow the three temporal phases shown for As, and
              | instead total aqueous Mn gradually increased over the course of the experiment in both
              | reaction chambers, reaching a maximum of 389 µM in the BIRN and 322 µM in the
              | Shewanella chamber (Figure 2.4A).
              |          Arsenic uptake on birnessite showed a rapid, linear increase over the first 0.7 h
              | (Figure 2.3C), with a sorption rate of 0.11 mol As kg-1 h-1. The sorption rate decreased
              | abruptly as the maximum [As]solid is reached, indicating an apparent cessation in As(III)
              | oxidation by birnessite.   To investigate the source of oxidation inhibition, we compared

text          |          The formation of rhodochrosite on birnessite after reaction with As(III) has not
              | been observed in previous studies.      A unique feature of the present experiment is
              | microbial respiration (on lactate), which results in increasing (bi)carbonate concentrations
              | that when combined with Mn(II) generation can lead to precipitation of MnCO3. The
              | saturation index of rhodochrosite calculated across the experimental timeframe (Figure
              | 2.4A) illustrates that precipitation becomes favorable. Reactive transport modeling was
              | used to simulate As(III) oxidation and adsorption dynamics within the Donnan reactor in
              | order to deconvolute the aqueous and solid phase reactions (reactions considered in the
              | model are presented in Table 2.1).
              |          The reaction network used to simulate As reactions within the Donnan cell
              | (described in detail within the supporting information) capture the change in
              | concentration of both oxidation states (Figure 2.3).    Both the rapid increase in As(V)
              | resulting from reaction with birnessite and the cessation of oxidation induced by MnCO3
              | surface precipitation are well described (Figure 2.3A). Further, the model reasonably
              | describes the decrease in aqueous As due to adsorption of As(V) on birnessite (Figure
              | 2.3C) and the production of As(III) by Shewanella (Figure 2.3B). The rate limiting
              | process throughout the reaction sequence is mass transfer between the reaction cell
              | induced by diffusion across the semi-permeable membrane—also well represented within

              | sediments. Previous studies have shown that reaction product formation and distribution

              | can be released into the aqueous phase. Subsequently, Mn(II) produced through the
              | oxidation of As(III) can re-adsorb onto the birnessite surface, which may progressively
              | decrease oxidation rates of As(III) (32-34). High concentration of reaction products,
              | Mn(II) and As(V), have been postulated to result in the formation of manganese(II)-
              | arsenate precipitates (14, 26, 35). However, manganese arsenate precipitates are unlikely
              | to be a major product in our experiments given the unperturbed increase in soluble Mn
              | concentrations within both chambers (Figure 2.4A) and the absence of an As signal in
              | energy dispersive spectra of the birnessite (data not shown). Instead, XRD data and
              | saturation indices are consistent with rhodochrosite formation on birnessite, which
              | subsequently limits its reactivity and leads to a decreased rate of As(III) oxidation (Figure
              | 2.1B).
              |          The formation of rhodochrosite is an unexpected product resulting from the
              | combined redox cycle. Carbonate (inclusive of bicarbonate) is generated from microbial
              | oxidation of lactate coupled to As(V) reduction while Mn(II) results from As(III)
              | oxidation by birnessite. As a consequence of these redox products, the saturation index
              | for rhodochrosite increases rapidly and becomes favorable for precipitation within 10 h of
              | reaction (Figure 2.4A). The consequence of rhodochrosite formation is an apparent
              | inhibition of the oxidative capacity of birnessite. By including an inhibition term in the
              | oxidation rate resulting from MnCO3 formation, the full time-series of the experiment is
              | well captured by the reactive transport model (Table 2.1, Eqn. 9 and Table A.1, Eqn. 3).
              |          Interestingly, removal of the rhodochrosite inhibition term from the reaction
              | network leads to a predicted maintenance of pseudo-steady state conditions within the
              | two chambers (Figure 2.5).        Arsenic(V) is rapidly formed by birnessite and then
              | continually reduced to As(III) by Shewanella sp. ANA-3; each reaction chamber reaches
              | a pseudo-steady state owing to the chemical (oxidation and reduction) rates exceeding
              | that of diffusion between the cells, and the reactions are perpetuated until either birnessite
              | or lactate are exhausted. A key factor in the reaction sequence is thus the microbial
              | generation of (bi)carbonate, along with As(III), which we can further assess through

              | concentration from 3 mM to 1 mM has little impact on the reaction sequence or resulting
              | As species concentration (Figure 2.6). However, further decreasing lactate to 0.3 mM
              | and 0.03 mM has the dual-impact of diminishing As(III) production and the extent of
              | rhodochrosite-induced inhibition of As(V) oxidation by birnessite (Figure 2.6); at 0.03

title         | 3.1 Abstract
text          | Manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) oxides are ubiquitous solids in terrestrial systems that
              | have high sorptive capacities for many trace metals, including arsenic (As). Although
              | numerous studies have characterized the effects of As adsorption onto Fe and Mn oxides
              | individually, the fate of arsenic within mixed systems representative of natural
              | environments is unresolved.     Here, we examine As(III) oxidation and competitive
              | retention of As on goethite and birnessite using a Donnan reactor, where each oxide is
              | isolated by a semi-permeable membrane through which arsenic can migrate. To initiate
              | the Donnan reactor experiments, As(III) is simultaneously added to both chambers.
              | Arsenic(III) injected into the birnessite chamber is rapidly oxidized to As(V) and then
              | slowly redistributes across both chambers, while that added to the goethite chamber
              | undergoes rapid adsorption; As(III) on goethite undergoes desorption and diffusion into
              | the birnessite chamber and subsequent oxidation to As(V). With increased reaction time,
              | As(V) is generated and preferentially partitioned onto goethite due to higher sorption
              | affinity compared to birnessite. Furthermore, reactive transport modeling demonstrates
              | that the amount of aqueous As available is controlled by the sorption capacity of the
              | goethite surface, which when saturated, leads to increased aqueous As concentrations.
              | Our findings show that Mn oxides in soils act as a temporary sorbent of As, but operate
              | primarily as strong oxidants responsible for transformation of As(III) to As(V), which
              | can then strongly adsorb on, and is ultimately immobilized by, the surrounding Fe oxide
              | matrix.

title         | 3.2 Introduction
text          |          Arsenic (As) is a naturally occurring toxic metalloid that is found at hazardous
              | concentrations in drinking water of many countries within South and Southeast Asia (1-
              | 3). Long-term consumption of arsenic-containing groundwater within these regions has
              | lead to chronic poisoning of millions of people who are now manifesting a wide-range of
              | human health problems including arsenicosis and various types of cancers (4, 5).
              |          The degree of As mobility in soils and sediments is, in part, governed by the
              | type of minerals present in the system and the oxidation state of As. Arsenic(III) and
              | As(V) are the dominant As oxidation states in soils and sediments, where As(V),
              | typically present as HxAsO4x-3, adsorbs to a wide-range of minerals including iron and
              | aluminum (hydr)oxides and aluminosilicates minerals; As(III), by contrast, is usually
              | present as the neutral H3AsO3 species in non-sulfidic environments and preferentially
              | adsorbs to iron (hydr)oxides (6, 7). Though it has been shown that As(III) can adsorb to
              | a greater extent on iron oxide surfaces than As(V) (8-10), a substantial portion of As(III)
              | is bound via weaker complexes (11-13) leading to extensive desorption in the presence of
              | advective flow (14) Tufano and Fendorf (14) demonstrated that the magnitude of As
              | desorbed from iron (hydr)oxide coated sands varied over time and initial As loading,
              | providing further evidence for the existence of multiple adsorption sites of varying
              | strengths.   These studies show the extent and magnitude of adsorption can vary
              | depending on oxide type, and the variation in surface coverage will lead to varying
              | desorption rates.
              |          Because As(V) and As(III) adsorb to differing extents, redox reactions of As
              | will have appreciable impacts on adsorption.      Minerals that can oxidize As, such as
              | manganese (Mn) oxides, will thus alter the extent of As retention. Manganese(III/IV)
              | oxides are strong oxidants that can oxidize and sequester many trace metals found in
              | nature (15-17). Arsenic(III) oxidation by Mn oxides leads to reductive alteration of the
              | surface, leading to enhanced As(V) retention compared to As(V)-treated birnessite (18).
              | The oxidation reaction of As(III) by birnessite proceeds via two dominant steps where 1)

              | by 2) the reaction of As(III) with MnOOH producing Mn2+ and As(V) (19).
              |          Within soils and sediments, various sorbents of As (such as Fe- and Mn-oxides)
              | coexist, leading to competitive adsorption reactions. Although numerous past studies
              | have characterized the effects of As adsorption onto Fe and Mn oxides individually (8,
              | 14, 18, 20-22), whether preferential adsorption of As onto one oxide over another will
              | occur remains unclear. Sun et al. (23) examined As adsorption in soils containing
              | ferromanganese nodules/Fe-Mn oxide mixtures reporting As(III) was oxidized and then
              | adsorbed onto the Fe-Mn mixed oxide; however, it was not possible to quantify and
              | compare the amount of As adsorbed on the individual oxide phases.
              |          The overall rate of reaction within soils and sediments depends upon the relative
              | rates of chemical reaction as compared to those of mass transfer (24).           For soils and
              | sediments, structural complexity gives rise to large pores through which solutes flow via
              | advection intersecting small pores of the bulk matrix in which mass transfer is dominated
              | by diffusion. Thus, accurate characterization and quantification of overall chemical
              | transformation within soils require an experimental context that allows for simultaneous
              | consideration of chemical reaction kinetics and diffusion-limited transport. Herein we
              | examine reactions controlled by competitive chemical reaction and diffusion processes
              | using a Donnan reactor composed of reaction cells separated by a semi-permeable
              | membrane. Diffusive transport controls the exchange of chemical species between the
              | neighboring cells, while chemical reaction controls the rate within the cells.
              |          Using the Donnan cell, we examine competitive retention and oxidation of As
              | on goethite ('-FeOOH) and birnessite under anoxic conditions, where each oxide is
              | isolated by a semi-permeable membrane through which As can migrate. Using a reactive
              | transport model (RTM), we are able to determine changes in adsorption dynamics at
              | environmentally relevant As(III) concentrations and alternate birnessite:goethite ratios.
              | Our results show that As(III) injected into both chambers is quickly oxidized by
              | birnessite, with As(V) then diffusing across the semi-permeable membrane where upon it
              | can adsorb on the goethite surface. Arsenic(III) initially adsorbed on goethite desorbs
              | and diffuses into the birnessite chamber in response to the concentration gradient
meta          | 50
text          | established as a result of As(III) oxidation. Therefore, the speciation of As on goethite
              | slowly shifts from As(III) to As(V), where the As(III) concentration changes in the
              | goethite chamber are essentially dependent on the rate of diffusion.       Although the
              | sorption capacity of birnessite is increased during As(III) oxidation due to surface
              | alterations, aqueous As(V) concentrations increase when the sorption capacity of goethite
              | has been exceeded. Our findings show that birnessite acts primarily as an oxidizing agent
              | to transform the more mobile As(III) to As(V), while goethite acts as the dominant
              | adsorbent after oxidation.

text          |          Birnessite was synthesized by dissolving 63 g of KMnO4 in one liter of doubly
              | deionized (DDI) water. The solution was heated to 90˚C and combined with 66 mL
              | concentrated HCl in a separate 4 L flask while being vigorously stirred. The reaction
              | continued at 90˚C for ten minutes, then cooled for 30 min before filtering through a
              | vacuum filtration system. Oxides captured by the filter were resuspended in DDI water
              | and filtered repeated to remove entrained KMnO4. The birnessite was then dried and
              | crushed using a mortar and pestle.

              | (composed of 10 mM PIPES, and 0.1 M NaCl), which was then sonicated for 60 minutes.
              | Arsenic(III) or As(V) was added to the oxide suspensions to achieve final concentrations
              | of 10, 20, 50, 100, 205, 400, 480, 600, 800, 1000, 1300, or 1600 µM. The reaction

              | removed, filtered through a 0.2 µm membrane, and acidified. The aqueous phase As
              | concentration was then measured using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission
              | spectrometry (ICP-OES). All experiments were conducted in triplicate. Adsorption data

              | the two oxides were placed in chambers separated by a semi-permeable membrane. At
              | both 480 and 40 µM As(III), As was rapidly oxidized by birnessite to As(V), which then

              | reaction, and As(III) decreased at the same rate. Similarly, when 40 µM As(III) is

title         | 3.4.2 Arsenic sorption onto goethite and birnessite.
text          |          At the higher As(III) concentration (480 µM As), on a mass basis of the solid, a
              | higher concentration of As was associated with birnessite than goethite throughout the
              | experiment–an average concentration of 110 µmol g-1 sorbed on birnessite and 21.6 µmol
              | g-1As on goethite after (pseudo) steady state is reached at approximately 52 h (Figure
              | 3.3). Conversely, at the lower As(III) concentration (40 µM As), a greater concentration
              | of As is initially (from 0 to 2.2 h) associated with birnessite, but then progressively
              | transfers (desorption, transport, re-adsorption) onto to goethite until a steady-state
              | concentration of 13.35 µmol g-1 is reached after 52 h of reaction (Figure 3.3).

text          |          At both concentrations examined, the proportion of As(III) and As(V) on the
              | goethite changed during reaction progression—As(III) concentration decreased while,
              | concomitantly, As(V) increased at a rate-dependent on diffusional transport across the
              | semi-permeable membrane separating the reaction cells. Therefore, As(III) and As(V)
              | ligand exchange on the goethite surface is more rapid than the rate of mass transfer that is
              | controlled by diffusion across the semi-permeable membrane. XANES spectroscopic
              | analysis of birnessite solids illustrated that all of the As was present in the pentavalent
              | state (data not shown).
              |          Oxidation of As(III) by birnessite leads to the reductive dissolution/
              | transformation of birnessite via Mn(IV) reduction to Mn(II), which can subsequently be
              | adsorbed by the remaining birnessite or released into the aqueous phase. The Mn(II) that
              | is released into the aqueous phase can diffuse from the birnessite chamber into the
              | goethite chamber and absorb on the iron oxide. Although limited within the 40 µM
              | As(III) system, reaction with 480 µM As(III) resulted in a progressive increase in Mn(II)
              | concentration on goethite (Figure 3.4B), with the rate of accumulation being, again,
              | diffusion controlled across the semi-permeable membrane.

text          |          We use reactive transport modeling to discern the influence of specific reactions
              | within a multi-process system and to expand the experimental condition through
              | predictive modeling. In order to calibrate the reactive transport model, a set of diffusion
              | and adsorption reactions were executed to acquire reaction rates and to constrain the
              | probable mechanisms in the system. To determine the diffusion rate of As(V) and
              | As(III), 480 µM As was injected into one chamber of the Donnan reactor and allowed to
              | diffuse into the neighboring chamber in the absence of Fe or Mn solids (Figure B.1). The
              | diffusion rate of As(V) and As(III) were nearly identical and thus no differences in
              | diffusion rates were applied in the RTM.

              | the sorptive capacity of the Mn solid. Our experiments are consistent with this finding,

              | greater when it is reacted with As(III) than with As(V) (Figure B.2). The difference in

title         | 3.5 Discussion
text          |          Iron and manganese oxides are ubiquitous solids found in terrestrial
              | environments that can act as sorbents for trace metals.         Our results illustrate the
              | concentration dependence of competitive sorption for As on multiple sorbents along with
              | the compounding impacts of As(III) oxidation and associated changes to the Mn-oxide
              | solid. Owing to the rapid oxidation of As(III) by birnessite, the final distribution of As
              | results from the competing affinities of goethite and reductively modified birnessite
              | surfaces for As(V); despite having a non-oxidizing sorbent separated by a semi-
              | permeable membrane, As(III) is fully oxidized to As(V). The resulting As(V) sorbed to a
              | greater extent on birnessite than goethite in the presence of high As concentration, while,
              | in contrast, goethite is the dominant adsorbent at lower concentrations (Figure 3.3).
              | Treatment of Fe-Mn binary oxide sorbent with a strong reductant was shown to increase
              | As(V) sorption, while decreasing sorption of As(III) (26).         Similarly, our results
              | demonstrate the alteration of the birnessite surface upon As(III) oxidation promotes
              | As(V) sorption–consistent with the findings of Manning et al. (2002)—with the increase
              | in sorption being proportional to the amount of As(III) reacted with the birnessite (Figure
              | 3.5).
              |          Although mechanistically unfounded, we are able to describe competitive
              | sorption between the two oxides with the RTM using two site types, weak and strong, on

              | 1. In the presence of low As concentrations, goethite sorbs greater concentration of As
              | than birnessite; however, at high As concentrations, adsorption sites on goethite surface
              | become saturated while a higher concentration of As is achieved on birnessite due to
              | reductive alteration (induced by reaction with As(III) and creation of high-energy sites).

              | birnessite and rapid adsorption/desorption, relative to the rate of mass transfer, of both As
              | species (Figure 3.2). Our findings are in agreement with past findings that As(III)
              | oxidation is exclusively controlled by Mn oxides under anoxic conditions and proceeds
              | rapidly (27), greatly exceeding the rate of diffusive transport. Arsenic sorption on both
              | birnessite and goethite were also well described at both concentrations using sorption
              | constants listed in Table 1. (Figure 3.3).
              |          Using RTM simulations we are able to provide an expansive prediction of
              | arsenic behavior for variations in arsenic concentration or mass ratios of competitive
              | sorbents. For As concentrations ranging from 20 to 0.4 µM, As(III) is rapidly oxidized
              | by birnessite, with the rate of oxidation increasing with As concentration in agreement
              | with the findings of Oscarson et al. (27). Depletion of As(III) within the birnessite
              | chamber establishes a concentration gradient that leads to As(III) migration from the
              | goethite chamber into the birnessite chamber where it is rapidly oxidized. By contrast,
              | within the concentrations explored here (20 to 0.4 uM), As(V) retention is dominated by
              | goethite, with As(V) generated in the birnessite chamber diffusing into the goethite
              | chamber and adsorbed (Figure 3.6); sorption is dominated by goethite across this
              | concentration range. Arsenic(III) sorption by Fe oxides is enhanced in the presence of
              | Mn oxides predominantly due to transformation to As(V), while also benefiting from the
              | creation of sorption sites (26, 28)
              |          Aqueous concentrations of As appear to be controlled by the combined
              | oxidation of As(III) by birnessite and subsequent adsorption of As(V) on goethite.
              | Although As(V) is retained on/in birnessite at the highest As concentration explored (480
              | mM), regulation of dissolved concentrations are limited (Figure 3.2). To further test the
              | premise that goethite dominates the retention of As, but is dependent on As(III) oxidation
              | by birnessite, we conducted a series of RTM simulations at varying birnessite to goethite
              | mass ratios with initial As(III) concentrations at 40 mM. When the mass of birnessite is
              | decreased relative to goethite, greater aqueous concentrations of As result (Figure 3.7).
              | Aqueous As(III) concentrations are negligible at all ratios, but as birnessite decreases the
              | rate of oxidation concomitantly decreases and results in proportionally higher total

              | Fe oxides), As(III) oxidation is restricted and a resulting increase in aqueous arsenic is
              | expected.

title         | 3.6 Conclusions
text          |          Arsenic migration through soil is determined, in part, by the oxidation state of
              | arsenic, sorption capacity of the matrix, and transport mechanisms. Our experimental
              | results combined with reactive transport modeling demonstrate that the rate of mass
              | transfer dominates adsorption/desorption and oxidation, of which both processes are
              | rapid relative to diffusion limited transport. Further, As(V) production is decreased as
              | the mass of birnessite available decreases, consistent with previous findings (18, 29).
              | Scott and Morgan (29) demonstrated As(V) is quickly desorbed after rapid oxidation by
              | birnessite resulting in high aqueous As concentrations. Due to the relatively rapid rate of
              | As(III) oxidation by birnessite, strong diffusional gradients are produced leading to
              | desorption and transport of As(III) that is initially sorbed on goethite. Arsenic(III) that is
              | removed from the surface of goethite is diffusionally transported and then rapidly
              | oxidized by Mn oxides. The resulting As(V) then diffuses back toward the goethite and
              | undergoes adsorption, consistent with previous findings that Mn oxides enhance the
              | uptake of As by Fe oxides through the conversion of As(III) to As(V) (28, 31, 32).
              | Although Mn-oxides exhibit an increase retention capacity for As(III) owing to surface
              | alteration upon oxidation to As(V), the aqueous concentrations of As increase
              | appreciably when the sorption capacity of goethite is exceeded, indicative of a lower
              | affinity for Mn oxides, even after reductive modification, for As(V) relative to Fe oxides

title         | 4.1 Abstract
text          |         The aggregate-based structure of soils imparts physical heterogeneity that that
              | gives rise to variation in microbial and chemical processes that may influence the
              | speciation and retention of trace elements such as As.      To examine the impact of
              | distributed redox conditions on the fate of As in soils systems, we imposed various redox
              | treatments upon constructed soil aggregates composed of ferrihydrite- and birnessite-
              | coated sands presorbed with As(V) and inoculation with the dissimilatory metal reducing
              | bacterium Shewanella sp. ANA-3. Aeration of the advecting solution surrounding the
              | aggregates was varied to simulate environmental conditions. We find that diffusion-
              | limited transport allows reducing conditions to persist in the interior of the aggregate
              | when aerated treatments are imposed, causing As, Mn, and Fe to migrate from the
              | reduced aggregate interiors and become immobilized at the aerated exterior region. Upon
              | transition to anoxic conditions, pulses of As, Mn and Fe are released into the advecting
              | solution outside of the aggregate in order of energetic yield coupled with lactate
              | oxidation during microbial respiration. Inversely, release of reduced species from the
              | aggregate into the advecting solution is inhibited upon transition from aerated to anoxic
              | conditions, where the oxidized exterior acts as an oxidizing adsorbent barrier.
              | Importantly, we find that As(III) oxidation by birnessite is appreciable only in the
              | presence of O2, where reductive dissolution of Mn oxides inhibits oxidation under
              | anaerobic conditions.   Our results demonstrate the importance of considering redox
              | conditions and the physical complexity of soils in determining the As dynamics, where
              | redox transitions can either enhance or inhibit As release due to speciation shifts in both
              | sorbents (solubilization versus precipitation of Fe and Mn oxides) and sorbates.

title         | 4.2 Introduction
text          |          Arsenic is a ubiquitous contaminant that jeopardizes water quality as a result of
              | both natural and anthropogenic sources (1). The mobility of As through soils, and
              | eventual contribution to surface or groundwater, is controlled by biological, chemical,
              | and physical processes (most notably that influence the oxidation state of As) that are
              | heterogeneously distributed within surface and subsurface environments. Within soil and
              | water systems at circumneutral pH, As(V) predominates under aerated, oxidizing
              | conditions as the oxyanion HxAsO4x-1, while arsenite, as H3AsO30, typically dominates
              | under anaerobic, reducing conditions. Arsenic(III), though binding extensively to iron
              | oxides, is generally considered the more mobile species of As (2), while As(V) is less
              | selective and adsorbs appreciably onto a variety of metal oxyhydroxides, hydroxides, and
              | oxides (here collectively referred to as oxides) including Fe, Al, and Mn oxides (3-5).
              |          In many environments, including seasonally saturated soils (6), bioturbated
              | sediments (7), and forest soils (8), temporary O2 depletion within soil aggregates results
              | from redox fluctuations (9, 10), where rapid switches in dominant metabolic processes
              | may occur (7). Iron and Mn oxides are produced by oxidative precipitation under aerated
              | conditions, while reductive dissolution reproduces Fe(II) and Mn(II) under anaerobic
              | conditions. The relative flux of Mn and Fe out of soils and sediments as a consequence
              | of reductive dissolution varies depending on biogeochemical pathways active in a certain
              | environment (11). Hence, microbial respiration upon Fe and Mn oxides may greatly
              | impact the transport of adsorbed trace metals including arsenic.
              |          Physical heterogeneity influences the extent and spatial distribution of oxidative
              | and reductive processes within soils and sediments.                Soils are composed of
              | microaggregates fused together by labile organic matter into macroaggregates (12, 13),
blank         | 
meta          | 70
text          | which form a complex matrix of transport mechanisms comprised of advective flow
              | channels between aggregates combined with diffusion-controlled intra-aggregate
              | transport (14-16). The rate of intra-aggregate transport of chemical species such as
              | oxygen from the aggregate exterior decreases toward the aggregate center due to
              | diminishing pore size, increased tortuosity, and discontinuities (16). Oxygen is further
              | limited within aggregates through microbial respiration, becoming depleted within
              | millimeters of the aggregate exterior (10, 17). Depletion of oxygen initiates microbial
              | anaerobic respiration alternative terminal electron acceptors, including As(V) and Fe(III)
              | and Mn(IV) oxides common to soil aggregates (18).
              |          Reductive dissolution and transformation of Fe and Mn oxides and As(V) have
              | been identified as the primary mechanisms controlling As mobilization within soils (1).
              | Anaerobic conditions in subsurface soils induce respiration of metal oxides and As(V),
              | ultimately leading to the release of arsenic into the aqueous phase as the surface area of
              | the Fe(III) oxides decreases during reductive transformation (3). Microbial reduction of
              | ferrihydrite initially results in sequestration of As concomitant with transformation to
              | magnetite; however, continued Fe reduction eventually prompts Fe oxide dissolution and
              | As release (3, 19).
              |          Manganese is a highly redox active element in natural systems. In its oxidized
              | forms (MnIII/IV) is serves as one of nature’s strongest oxidants and a potent adsorbent of
              | many trace metals (20). Higher valent forms of manganese can undergo dissimilatory
              | reduction to Mn(II) under anaerobic conditions, while Mn(II), which is kinetically
              | stabilized towards oxidation at circumneutral pH, is oxidized by molecular oxygen via
              | mineral surface or bacterial catalysis (21).
              |          Here, we examine the combined effects of redox oscillations and physical
              | heterogeneity on transport and transformation of As.         Using synthetic aggregates
              | composed of birnessite- and ferrihydrite-coated quartz sands presorbed with As(V), we
              | examined the effects of redox fluctuations on the mobilization and speciation of As
              | within a chemically and physically complex system. The aggregates were inoculated
              | with dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria Shewanella sp. ANA-3, capable of respiring
              | upon As(V), Fe(III), and Mn(IV) and placed in aerated, anoxic, and redox transitioning

              | highly similar even under different aeration/redox treatments, where As, Fe, and Mn
              | redox cycling is only active within the outer 3 millimeters of the aggregate exterior.
              | Under aerated conditions, the exterior of the aggregate remains oxic, forming an Fe(III)

              | aggregate. In the presence of aeration of advective flow path external of the aggregate,
              | Fe migrates from the interior and accumulates at the exterior relative to initial
              | concentrations. However, Mn(II) elution occurs independent of aeration status, albeit to
              | a lesser extent in the presence of oxygen. Manganese(II) released from the aggregate
              | occurs prior to Fe(II) release, following thermodynamic favorability of microbial electron

              | mm), ‘M’ for midsection (3.5 to 7.5 mm), and ‘I’ for interior (7.5 to 12.5 mm). Sands

              | 1000 eV above the Fe K-edge at 7111 eV. Fe solid-phase speciation was quantified by
              | performing linear combination fitting on Fe EXAFS collected on bulk samples with k3-
              | weighted EXAFS spectra of Fe standard compounds using the SIXPACK interface to
              | IFFEFIT (Webb, 2005). Iron fluorescence spectra were normalized and backscattering
              | contribution isolated by spline function subtraction.      Normalized data (eV) were
              | converted to k-space (Å-1), and k3 weighted. Linear-combination fitting was performed
              | from 3 to 14 Å-1 and results were evaluated based on reduced X2 values. Ferrihydrite,
              | magnetite, and goethite were chosen as reference compounds for fittings based on
              | reaction products reported in similar past studies (19), and phases identified using
              | scanning electron microscopy (SEM).         Arsenic speciation of bulk samples were
              | determined by analyzing the near-edge portion of the As spectra collected from 240 eV
              | below to 430 eV above the As(V) K-edge at 11874 eV. Ratio of As(III) and As(V)
              | adsorbed to solid phase samples were determined with linear-combination fitting of
              | normalized XANES spectra with spectra collected for As(III) and As(V)-sorbed
              | ferrihydrite as fitting standards.
              |          Micro-X-ray fluorescence (µ-XRF) analysis of radial slices of each aggregate
              | was carried out at beamline 2-3 at SSRL and beamline 10.3.2 at ALS to map the spatial
              | distribution of As(III), As(V), Fe, and Mn from the exterior to interior of aggregates.
              | Aggregate slices were dried in anaerobic glove-bag, embedded in EPOTEK301-2FL
              | epoxy, thin-sectioned to 30 µm thickness and mounted on a quartz slide. Maps were
              | taken at three energies (11871, 11874, and 11880 eV) at 6 to 10 µm step size for low-
              | resolution maps and 2 to 5 µm step size for high-resolution maps. Arsenic µ-XANES
              | points were chosen using µ-XRF maps and analyzed for As(V)/As(III) ratio at each
              | location using the same analysis technique described for As speciation on bulk samples.

title         | 4.4.1 Aqueous phase results from aggregate reactors.
text          |          Under aerated conditions, effluent As(V) is an initial concentration >50 µM but
              | undergoes rapid decay to a pseudo-steady-state concentration of ~2 µM decreased below
              | As(III) concentration after 2 d of reaction (Figure 4.1A). Arsenic(III) concentration is
              | initially lower than that of As(V), but over the first ~25 d undergoes a more gradual
              | decrease then becoming the dominant form of As in the effluent from 2 to 23 d of
              | reaction; after 25 d of elution, its concentration decreases below our level of detection
              | (Figure 4.1A). Overall, a greater mass of As(III) was eluted from the reactor than As(V),
              | with a total of 8.26 and 4.57 µmol removed, respectively. Effluent Mn(II) concentrations
              | increase from 2.7 to 130 µM after 6 d of reaction followed by gradual decreased to 40
              | µM over the remainder of the reaction period (Figure 4.1B). Aqueous Fe(II) remained at
              | or below the detection limit in the presence of oxygen (Figure 4.1B).
              |          Under anoxic advecting solute conditions, As(III) was the dominant As species
              | from the first sampling, with As(V) near or below detection limit throughout the
              | experiment (Figure 4.2A). Manganese(II) concentrations peaked after 6 d of reaction, as
              | seen under aerated treatment; however, the maximum concentration of Mn(II) measured
              | was nearly three folds greater (372 µM) than the maximum under aerated conditions (126
              | µM) (Figure 4.2B). Effluent Mn(II) concentrations began to decrease after 7 d, with

              |          When anoxic reactors are transitioned to oxic conditions in the advecting
              | solution after a 20 d reaction period, As(III) concentrations dominated over As(V) in the
              | effluent throughout the experimental period (Figure 4.3A). Total As concentrations
              | gradually decreased from 54 µM to 18 µM over the first 17 d of anoxic solution addition;
              | upon switching to aerated conditions, a decrease in total effluent As concentration from
              | 18 µM to 13 µM (Figure 4.3A) results. Response to the aeration transition was also
              | reflected in Fe(II) concentrations, where effluent Fe(II) concentrations peaked just before
              | the switch to aerated conditions, where upon Fe decreased rapidly to our level of
              | detection.   Manganese(II) concentrations are less affected by transition to aerated
              | conditions owing to effective depletion of Mn in the eluting solution over the first 20 d—
              | a maximum concentration occurs after 6 d of reaction (consistent under all aeration
              | treatments) and then undergoes progressive decay for the next 14 d.
              |          For aggregates first subjected to aerated advecting solutions, a switch to
              | anaerobic conditions after 20 d leads to a nearly immediate pulse (2 d) of As(III), a
              | rebound in Mn(II) concentration, and a progressive increase in Fe(II) within effluent
              | solutions. Similar to results from the continually aerated aggregate reactor, during the
              | aeration period As(III) concentrations increase to a maximum of %30 uM within the first
              | 5 d and then progressively decreases until the cessation of aeration at day 20. A pulse of
              | As(III) (increase from 10 to 16 µmol L-1) occurred 2 d after the transition to anoxic
              | advecting solution conditions. Similarly, Mn(II) concentrations decrease from 200 µM
              | on day 6 to 107 µM over 11 d under aerated advecting solution conditions; upon the
              | transition to anoxic exterior conditions, a second pulse of Mn(II) was released, reaching a
              | comparable magnitude (210 µM) as the first concentration peak and then decaying to 40
              | µM over the following 11 d. Iron(II) concentrations were below detection limit under
              | aerated conditions (20 d), and then increased rapidly to 201 µM 5 d after the transition to
              | anoxic exterior conditions, reaching a maximum concentration of 225 µM.

title         | 4.5 Discussion
text          |          Reduction-oxidation (redox) transitions in soils lead to the redistribution of
              | metal oxides and sorbed trace metals. We examined the effects of prolonged aerated and
              | anoxic conditions on synthetic aggregates composed of As(V) presorbed ferrihydrite- and
              | birnessite coated sands inoculated with dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria, Shewanella
              | sp. ANA-3, which are capable of respiring upon all three metals and oxygen while
              | utilizing lactate as a carbon and electron source. Furthermore, a comparison is made
              | between aggregates that undergo single aeration treatment (i.e. continuously anoxic or
              | aerated conditions) and aeration status transitioned aggregates, which were maintained
              | under aerated or anoxic conditions for 20 days then switched to anoxic or aerated
              | environments for another 30 days.
              |          Spatial redistribution and speciation of As, Fe, and Mn within the aggregates are
              | controlled by redox gradients resulting from progressively decreasing oxygen
              | concentrations as one approaches the aggregate interior. As was clearly illustrated by
              | Masue-Slowey et al. (17), that despite having ample oxygen supplied at the aggregate
              | exterior under aerated conditions, anaerobic conditions arise within millimeters of the
              | exterior due to greater rate of oxygen respiration by Shewanella than rate of oxygen
              | diffusion into the aggregate. Hence, for elements such as Fe and Mn that have more
              | mobile reduced, biogeochemical conditions of aggregate interior leads to mobilization
              | and diffusion toward the exterior.     When the advecting solution is aerated, Fe(II)
              | produced within the aggregate interior diffuses toward the exterior where upon it
              | undergoes oxidation.     Subsequent precipitation of Fe(III) oxide results in the co-
              | association of As, which also diffuses from the reducing aggregate interior toward the
              | exterior. Upon reaching the metal oxide rind, As(III) is oxidized to As(V) by residual

              | aggregate exterior (Figures 4.6 and 4.7). Interestingly, As redistribution within the
              | aggregates was highly similar between all aeration treatments (Figure 4.5), with
              | increasing As/Fe ratios approaching the interior indicative of As retention concomitant
              | with release of Fe. Microbial respiration of ferrihydrite is active in the anaerobic center of
              | the aggregate to comparable levels to those exposed to anoxic advecting solutes, leading
              | to production of Fe(II). These results demonstrate that influence of oxygen (or aeration
              | status) on As dynamics is most pronounced in the exterior section, whereas reducing
              | conditions in the interior are similar across various aeration conditions.
              |          Arsenic that is accumulated in the Fe oxide exterior under aerated conditions
              | was predicted to mobilize under anaerobic conditions (18). Our results support this
              | hypothesis, where As concentrations in the effluent of aerated-to-anoxic aggregate
              | gradually decreased over the first 20 days of aeration being composed of a mixture of
              | As(V) and As(III). When anoxic conditions were imposed upon the aerated aggregate on
              | day 20, a pulse of As was released and As(V) concentrations in the effluent decreased
              | (Figure 4.4B). Manganese and Fe were also measured in the effluent, though their peak
              | concentrations were delayed by 4 and 13 d, respectively, compared to peak As
              | concentration. Therefore, as the redox status of the exterior environment (advecting
              | solution) shifts from aerobic to anaerobic, an immediate pulse of As release occurs which
              | is then followed by Mn and Fe.      Multiple studies support the release of As independent
              | of Fe reduction, consistent with our finding that Fe elution is not a prerequisite for As
              | release from the constructed aggregates (17, 19, 24). Reverting to aerated conditions
              | after anoxic treatment slowly decreases the rate of As release, as demonstrated by the
              | decrease in total As eluted after aeration onset, and As(V) re-appears in the effluent
              | concomitant with Fe oxidation and removal from effluent (Figure 4.2A and 4.4A).
              |          Regardless of aeration status, As(III) composes approximately 80 mol-% of the
              | total solid phase As within the aggregate at distances greater than ~3 mm from the
              | advective flow channel.      Therefore, As redox cycling occurs predominantly in the
              | exterior region of the aggregate, while mid and interior sections are highly reducing. The
              | predominantly As(III)-containing interior shows that As(III) oxidation by Mn oxides is
meta          | 88
text          | minimal and likely only occurs transiently prior to anoxic onset within the aggregate
              | interior. Conditions that promote Mn reduction inhibits appreciable As(III) oxidation due
              | to reductive dissolution of Mn oxides; our results demonstrate that the presence of O2 is
              | required for Mn oxides to be an effective oxidant of As(III) under conditions operative
              | for dissimilatory reduction of Mn. Similarly, Tokunaga et al. (14) demonstrated that
              | immediately following carbon amendment to sediments containing U(VI) and Fe and Mn
              | oxides, rapid and complete reduction of Mn(III,IV) oxides to Mn(II) was observed
              | indicating Mn oxides were not involved in U(IV) oxidation after dissolution. Instead,
              | As(III) oxidation by Mn oxides likely takes place in the aggregate exterior regions, where
              | As(III) diffused from the interior can be rapidly oxidized by Mn oxides and subsequently
              | adsorbed to the surrounding Fe oxide matrix.
              |          Our results illustrate that oxic and anoxic cycling of soils will alter the retention
              | and distribution of trace elements such as arsenic. Owing to mass transfer limited O2
              | supply and sustained microbial activity, only the exterior region (outer few millimeters)
              | of soil aggregates may be aerobic even under seemingly well aerated conditions. Owing
              | the diffusive gradients established from the anaerobic aggregate interior and aerobic
              | exterior, redox active elements such as Fe, Mn, and As, all having generally more
              | soluble/mobile species under reducing conditions, will migrated and build in
              | concentration at aggregate exteriors.      Upon a transition from aerobic to anaerobic
              | conditions, the accumulated elements will be released to the aqueous phase and result in a
              | concentration pulse within advecting waters. However, the effluent profiles for Mn and
              | Fe differ considerably. Respiration on Mn oxides is thermodynamically more favorable
              | than reduction of Fe oxides when coupled with most carbon sources (18).               Hence,
              | sediment profiles containing both Mn and Fe oxides generally exhibit clearly stratified
              | redox layers where Mn reduction occurs at shallower depths than Fe reduction (25).
              | Similarly, Mn(II) elution from aggregates under anoxic conditions occurred prior to
              | Fe(II) elution. Manganese flux from the aggregates occurred under both aerated and
              | anoxic conditions due to the large activation energy required to oxidize Mn(II) and the
              | requirement for a microbial or mineral catalyst (21, 26, 27); in contrast, abiotic Fe(II)
              | oxidation by molecular oxygen is rapid (28), making Fe flux out of aggregates much

              | aggregate exteriors and limited release to groundwater. Certain trace metals have been
              | found to be more strictly associated with Mn oxides versus Fe oxides; temporal variations
              | in trace metal efflux from soils and sediments may, therefore, be caused by the

title         | 4.6 Conclusions
text          |          Fate and transport of As, Fe, and Mn is influenced by both redox transitions and
              | the physical heterogeneity inherent to soils that results in a distribution of biogeochemical
              | conditions. The structure of soil aggregates allows reductive processes to persist within
              | the aggregate interiors even under seemingly aerated conditions, with oxidizing processes
              | being restricted to only a few millimeters of aggregate exteriors. Therefore, reductive
              | dissolution of As, Mn, and Fe (and reduction of a large suite of constituents) actively
              | occur regardless of oxygenation within advective flow channels surrounding soil
              | aggregate. However, release of reduced species from aggregates is highly dependent
              | upon the metal and aeration status; Mn elution occurs prior to the release of Fe and can
              | be operative under aerated or anoxic conditions, while Fe is only released out of the
              | aggregate when the Fe oxide rind is reduced. However, rapid Mn(II) oxidation by
              | Mn(II)-oxidizing microorganisms has been observed in many oxic environments (29), a
              | process that can inhibit Mn elution from aggregates in a similar fashion to abiotic
              | oxidation of Fe(II). Interestingly, As elution from the aggregate is continuous and
              | comparable under aerated and anoxic conditions; however, As accumulated on the
              | aggregate exterior (due to adsorption onto Fe oxides formed the oxidation from Fe(II)
              | diffused from aggregate interior), is released when aerated flow channels transition to
              | anoxic conditions, producing a sudden high concentration discharge of As into the
              | advective flow channel. Collectively, our results demonstrate the importance of soil
              | structure and redox transitions when assessing the mobilization, speciation, and flux of
              | metal species from soils and sediments.

text          |          Arsenic (As) cycling within soils and sediments of the Mekong Delta of
              | Cambodia is strongly affected by drastic redox fluctuations caused by seasonal
              | monsoons. Repeated oxidation and reduction of soils, which contain 10-40 mg kg-1 As,
              | lead to the eventual downward movement of As to the underlying aquifer. Extensive
              | flooding during monsoon seasons creates anoxic soil conditions that favor anaerobic
              | microbial metabolic processes, including arsenate (As(V)) respiration–a process
              | contributing to the mobilization of As. Amplification of a highly conserved functional
              | gene encoding dissimilatory As(V) reductase, arrA, can be used as a molecular marker to
              | detect the genetic potential for As(V) respiration in environmental samples. However,
              | few studies have successfully amplified arrA without prior enrichment, and factors
              | influencing sequence diversity are currently unknown. In the present study, we examine
              | the distribution and diversity of arrA genes amplified from multiple study sites within the
              | Mekong Delta at various soil depths (10, 50, 100, 200, and 400 cm). Additionally, results
              | from geochemical analysis of soil porewater collected using lysimeters at the
              | corresponding depths were applied in multivariate analysis to determine whether
              | variations in arrA sequence could be explained by environmental factors. Here we report
              | successful amplification, cloning, and sequencing of 223 novel arrA gene sequences from
              | Cambodia soils without prior enrichment/stimulation, collectively forming a clade that is

              | permutational MANOVA demonstrates that As and depth variables are most strongly
              | associated with variations in arrA sequences, whereas a number of other porewater
              | constituents (including Fe) appeared insignificant.      Our findings demonstrate the
              | potential for using biogeochemically and ecologically relevant functional genes to
              | understand operative geochemical processes and, in particular, conditions promoting the
              | mobilization of arsenic within flooded, tropical soils—systems where arsenic is having a

title         | 5.2 Introduction
text          |         Millions in south and southeast Asia are currently exposed to arsenic (As)
              | concentrations as high as three orders of magnitude greater than the WHO suggested
              | limit of 10 µg L-1. Arsenic-bearing minerals derived from the Himalayas is transported
              | down river channels and deposited into deltas below including the Ganges–Brahmaputra–
              | Meghna (1, 2), Red River (3), and Mekong River deltas (2, 4, 5). Whereas groundwater
              | irrigation has been employed for many decades within the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna
              | basin, groundwater pumping is limited within the Mekong Delta, providing a less
              | perturbed representation of the As release within southeast Asia. Studies have reported
              | that, even with relatively minimal groundwater extraction, aquifer As concentrations in
              | one of the most densely populated area of the Mekong Delta (between the Mekong and
              | Basaac Rivers) range from 100 to >1000 )g L-1, with an average of ~ 500 )g L-1 (2, 4).
              | Redox processes within near-surface sediments are responsible for the supply and release
              | of As into groundwater (2, 4).     Oxidation of Himalayan-derived As-bearing sulfur
              | minerals deposited in the surface sediments releases As, which is temporarily
              | immobilized through adsorption onto Fe(III) oxides, hydroxides, and oxyhydroxides
              | (collectively referred to as oxides) in surrounding sediment matrix. Subsequent reductive
              | dissolution of Fe(III) oxides and As(V) reduction under reducing conditions during the
              | wet season leads to desorption and partitioning of As into the aqueous phase.
              | Arsenic(V), the predominant oxidation state under oxic conditions, is generally

meta          | 96
text          | considered the less mobile species; in contrast, As(III) dominates under reducing
              | conditions and, although adsorbs more extensively onto Fe oxides, is loosely bound and
              | thus more mobile under flow conditions. Therefore, characterization of factors and
              | processes responsible for the reduction of As(V) is crucial toward understanding As
              | transport.
              |          Under anaerobic conditions, a major pathway contributing to the transformation
              | of As(V) is microbial respiration of As(V), which has been shown to provide greater
              | energetic yield than respiration on goethite and hematite under environmental conditions
              | in Cambodian sediments (6). Dissimilatory As(V)-reducing bacteria (DARB) have been
              | isolated from a wide range of environments and are phylogenetically and physiologically
              | diverse (7). A number of studies have identified and characterized enzymes that catalyze
              | As(V) respiration (8-11). The reductase is a periplasmic heterodimer composed of the
              | terminal reductase, ArrA (87-110 kDa), and ArrB (25.7-34 kDa), which provides
              | electrons to ArrA from c-type cytochromes (9-11).
              |          Model organisms are invaluable for deciphering biochemical mechanisms
              | responsible for As transformation under constrained laboratory conditions; however,
              | these organisms and their functional genes may not be representative of those found in
              | the environment. To this end, the diversity of arrA has only been explored in a limited
              | number of environments, namely estuarine sediments of Chesapeake bay (12), aquifer
              | sediments from West Bengal (13), and As-rich soda lakes (14, 15). Previously, Lear et
              | al. (16) examined arrA genes in acetate-amended Cambodian sediments collected from 9
              | m depth after 16 and 30 days of incubations, but were unable to amplify any products

              | been thoroughly discussed previously (2, 4, 19). Near surface intact cores were sampled
              | using the procedure described in (4). Briefly, intact core samples were collected by hand-
              | augering to 10, 50, 100, 200, and 400 cm depth with a soil sampling device fitted with a

              | (Mitsubishi) to maintain anaerobic conditions.        Core samples were homogenized
              | aseptically using mortar and pestal in an anaerobic chamber, and triplicate subcores were
              | taken with sterile 5-mL syringes and sealed in anaerobic containers stored at -80 ˚C prior

              | length greater than 570 bp were exported to FASTA format and processed/trimmed to the
              | appropriate arrA open-reading frame using a custom script written with Biostings/R (21).
              | Trimmed arrA sequences that were still larger than 570 bp and had unambiguous
              | similarity with known arrA were translated and imported back into Geneious as amino

text          |          In order to assess differences in the arrA ecotypes present in a particular sample,
              | we calculated the weighted-UniFrac distance metric for all pair-wise combinations of

              | table, which by implication requires a species definition for arrA. We took a somewhat
              | strict 98% amino acid similarity cutoff (as measured in branch-length on the phylogenetic
              | tree) as the species definition to build the abundance table, using the tipglom function
              | in the phyloseq package.          The subsequent arrA species abundance matrix and
              | phylogenetic tree were provided as input to weighted-UniFrac, as implemented in
              | phyloseq/R. The resulting weighted-UniFrac distance matrix was used in PERMANOVA

              | sequences were included in a maximum likelihood estimate of the ArrA phylogeny
              | (Figure 5.1).   We arbitrarily defined 0.02 average amino acid substitutions per site
              | (branch length) as a cutoff for a stringent definition of an operational taxonomic unit
              | (OTU), calculated by the tipglom function in phyloseq, resulting in a total of 173 ArrA
              | phylotypes. In general, putative ArrA sequences obtained from Cambodia sediment
              | formed a separate monocladistic group that is most closely related to the arrA gene in
              | Geobacter uranireducens and Geobacter lovleyii (Figure 1).
              |          Sequences acquired in the present study were compared phylogenetically to
              | environmental predicted ArrA sequences from Chesapeake Bay (12) and West Bengal
              | (13), made possible by the application of the same nested PCR method and primer set in
              | all three studies, which provided highly comparable product length and arrA region
              | amplified. A great majority (>90%) of sequences acquired from near-surface Cambodian
              | sediments form a distinct cluster from the Chesapeake Bay and West Bengal ArrA
              | sequences. The remaining sequences fell within the DARB isolate cluster, with closest
              | neighbor sequences from Chesapeake Bay. Previously, sequences from Chesapeake Bay
              | were reported to form distinct phylogenetic clusters from DARB isolates; however,
              | application of maximum likelihood rather than neighbor-joining method for tree
              | construction placed 51 (70%) sequences from Chesapeake Bay within the DARB isolate
              | cluster. Although neighbor-joining method is computationally efficient, it has several
              | well-understood weaknesses that make it a poor choice for estimating complex
              | phylogenies, whereas estimating phylogeny using maximum likelihood is demonstrably
              | more robust and consistent when encountering assumption violations (25). The ArrA
              | phylogenetic trees presented here are the first to be constructed with maximum likelihood
              | method and may provide a more accurate estimate of the relationship between clones
              | from various sites.   Hery et al. (13) states that 10 arrA sequences acquired from
              | Cambodian sediments after enrichment/stimulation with As(V) and acetate amendments
              | (16) cluster separately from West Bengal sequences; however, sequences from that study
              | are unavailable and thus we are unable to make comparisons to those obtained within our
              | current study. Nevertheless, our current dataset supports the conclusion that clones from

title         | 5.4.2 Permutational MANOVA analysis.
text          |           To determine whether variations in environmental factors can explain variations
              | observed in arrA sequence data, we applied permutational multivariate analysis of
              | variance (PERMANOVA) using distance matrix calculated by weighted UniFrac method
              | (26). PERMANOVA is a non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance
              | that is less stringent than traditional multivariate analyses and is, therefore, more
              | appropriate for ecological data (27). We were able to determine whether variation in
              | porewater chemistry (provided in Table 5.1) explained variations in As(V)-reducing
              | microbial community structure.           Results indicate that variation in depth and As
              | concentrations in porewater are weakly associated (P = 0.06 and 0.07, respectively) with
              | variations in arrA sequences between samples, while other pore-water aqueous
              | constituents do not appear significant (Table 5.3).
              |           Variations in As(V)-reducing microbial communities associated with depth and
              | As concentrations can be explained by shifts in active redox processes with increasing

              | cracks, due to the great shrink-swell capacity of clays, leading to aeration and adsorption
              | of As on Fe(III) oxides at shallow depths (< 1 m) (4). However, deeper depths (>1 cm)
              | are highly reducing throughout both the dry and wet seasons, where sediment color
              | transitions to gray and As concentrations are no longer strongly correlated with Fe and
              | alkalinity (4). Arsenic(V)-respiring microorganisms are most likely active in the near
              | surface sediments where fresh carbon sources are deposited annually (e.g. detritus from
              | plants and animals) and As(V) is available. At depths >1 m, As is present mostly in the
              | reduced form and, therefore, As(V)-respiration likely plays a minor role in As cycling.

text          |          The fate and transport of As in soils and sediments is determined by a complex
              | interplay of chemical, biological, and physical factors. To this end, this thesis aimed to
              | decipher the combined effects of biotic and abiotic reactions controlling As redox,
              | sorption, and transport processes within systems that simulate the physical complexity of
              | soil systems.
              |          Mass transfer limitations within soil systems causes steep concentration
              | gradients that form redox interfaces. Competitive reduction and oxidation reactions may
              | take place at such boundaries, altering the fate of As due to fluctuations in As speciation.
              | In Chapter 2, I show that at the interface of a strong oxidant, birnessite, and reductant,
              | As(V)-reducing bacteria, As can be cycled between oxidized and reduced forms.
              | Arsenic(III) is rapidly oxidized by birnessite, producing As(V) which can then be
              | reduced back to As(III).     The oxidation of As(III) reductively dissolves birnessite,
              | releasing Mn(II) into solution. During dissimilatory As(V) reduction, lactate oxidation
              | also results in the production of (bi)-carbonate. Initially, I hypothesized that the final
              | ratio of As(V) to As(III) would be determined by the ratio of birnessite relative to the
              | electron donor used for microbial respiration. Theoretically, As(V) would continue to be
              | generated until the exhaustion of the oxidant (birnessite) and, conversely, As(III)
              | concentrations would be expected to diminish only after lactate source is depleted.
              | However, I discovered that the redox cycle becomes short-circuited in the presence of
              | chemically and biologically produced reaction products: the products of the As oxidation
              | and reduction reactions combine to precipitate rhodochrosite (MnCO3), which
              | subsequently inhibits As(III) oxidation through birnessite surface passivation. Reactive
              | transport modeling predictions demonstrated that decreased supply of lactate decreases
              | the extent of As(III) production due to limiting carbon source for As(V) respiration,

              | diffusion limited mass transport of solutes. This finding has important implications on
              | the speciation of As in soils where physical complexity can induce separated
              | biogeochemical islands that interact through diffusion controlled mass transfer. My
              | results demonstrate that products from biologically driven reaction products can alter the
              | expected rates and extent of redox processes taking place at redox interfaces within
              | diffusion limited systems like soils.
              |          Although Chapter 2 explored the role of Mn oxides as an oxidant of As(III) that
              | is reductively dissolved during the oxidation process, Mn oxides can be regenerated by
              | Mn(II) oxidation pathways in soil systems, controlling the concentration of Mn(II) in
              | solution. A majority of Mn oxides in the environment are biogenically produced (1),
              | where the oxidative and sorptive properties of biogenic manganese oxides differ from
              | those of synthetic Mn oxides. The presence of Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria may maintain a
              | lower aqueous concentration of Mn(II) through precipitation of Mn oxides, preventing
              | the formation of rhodochrosite, and thus allowing rapid redox cycling of As to be
              | maintained. Further exploration is needed to determine the role of biological processes in
              | Mn oxidation and its influence on As redox cycling.
              |          The combined effects of oxidation and competitive adsorption of As onto
              | multiple sorbents available in soils can greatly impact the release of As from the solid
              | phase. In Chapter 3, I demonstrate that in the presence of both birnessite and goethite,
              | As(III) is rapidly oxidized to As(V) by birnessite, and oxidation rate is dependent upon
              | birnessite mass and As(III) concentrations, consistent with previous findings (2, 3).
              | Arsenic(V)    then   preferentially     partitions   onto   goethite   with   aqueous   As(V)
              | concentrations determined by the degree of surface coverage; saturation of the goethite
              | surface leads to a proportional increase in the aqueous concentration. My findings show
              | that within soil matrices composed of a mixture of Mn and Fe oxides, Mn oxides operate
              | primarily as oxidants of As(III) to form the more strongly sorbing As(V); ultimately, Fe
              | oxides are the primary adsorbents immobilizing As(V) within soil systems.
              |          I examine the combined effects of competitive reduction-oxidation reactions

              | Accordingly, in Chapter 4, I reveal the mechanisms involved in As cycling within
              | synthetic aggregates composed of Mn and Fe oxide coated sands inoculated with As(V)-
              | reducing bacteria.    The release and speciation of dissolved As, Mn, and Fe from
              | aggregates is highly dependent upon redox status.        Even as the advecting solution
              | surrounding the aggregate is aerated, a reducing interior is formed where As, Mn, and Fe
              | are desorbed and mobilized to the oxygenated exterior realm of the aggregate. Reduced
              | species of As, Mn, and Fe are transported from the aggregate center and accumulate on
              | the exterior rind of the aggregate. Upon transition to anaerobic conditions in advecting
              | solution, a pulse of all three constituents is released into the advecting solution.
              | Conversely, transition from anaerobic to aerated conditions leads to decrease in release of
              | reduced species into the advecting channel because of oxidation precipitation of Fe and
              | Mn oxides. Additionally, As(III) oxidation by Mn oxides is only appreciable in the
              | presence of O2; the rapid dissimilatory reduction of Mn oxides after the onset of anoxic
              | conditions inhibits further oxidation. Collectively, these results show that As retention is
              | dependent upon redox conditions within soil, where retention and release can be highly
              | variable, spatially and temporally.
              |          In addition to chemical and physical heterogeneity, biological diversity
              | contributes to the complexity of operative processes within soil systems. Accordingly, I
              | surveyed the microbial ecology of As(V) reduction in soils of the Mekong Delta, where
              | As cycling plays a crucial role in the health and safety of millions. Dissimilatory As(V)-
              | respiring bacteria (DARBs) have been shown to catalyze the reduction of As in many
              | environments (5). However, the community structure of DARBs, which can reflect local
              | chemical conditions, has not been thoroughly explored in the environment. In Chapter 5,
              | I discovered that sequences encoding functional gene arrA amplified from the Mekong
              | Delta of Cambodia composed a novel, phylogenetically distinct clade. Furthermore,
              | application of permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrix
              | calculated from the constructed phylogenetic tree demonstrates that variations in
              | community structure can be explained by variations in porewater As concentration and
              | soil depth. However, changes in community structure of As(V)-reducing bacteria is

text          |         The framework of our simulation is divided into a finite difference matrix
              | consisting of three cells representing two chambers separated by a permeable membrane
              | (representing the third cell). Dirichlet (fixed head) boundaries are set at both ends of the
              | three-cell domain to simulate a closed system. The heads within both chambers remain
              | identical at all times; therefore, there is no hydraulic gradient. Hence, hydraulic
              | conductivities are not applicable in this system, and transport is solely governed by
              | diffusion.
              |         The biogeochemical conceptual model of our system is summarized in Table 2.1
              | in Chapter 2, and can be divided into the following processes: 1) abiotic oxidation of
              | As(III) by birnessite (eq. 1-3), 2) reductive dissolution of birnessite (eq. 4), 3) microbial
              | reduction of As(V) with lactate oxidation to acetate (eq. 5), 4) adsorption/desorption of
              | As(V) and As(III) from birnessite (eq. 6-8), and 5) precipitation of rhodochrosite (eq. 9).
              |         Rhodochrosite precipitation is allowed upon Mn2+/CO32- reaching saturation, the
              | formation of which inhibits As(III) oxidation by birnessite (eq. 1) by defining
              | rhodochrosite species as an inhibition term with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 1.5x10-10.
              | Arsenic adsorption/desorption is described using a simple reversible equilibrium
              | expression formulated by Dzombeck and Morel (38) as described by Mayer et al. (36,
              | 39). The diffusion coefficient was calibrated to As concentrations measured in chambers
              | over time when As was injected in the absence of bacteria and birnessite.
              |         Within the chamber cells, rates of inter-aqueous and heterogeneous reactions were
              | described according to the general formulation:

text          |     For every 1 mol of lactate oxidized via reduction of arsenate, 1 mol of carbonate and 1
              |     mol of acetate are produced. pH of the solutions remained constant owing to the addition
              |     of high concentration of PIPES buffer; therefore, the concentration of carbonate within
              |     the system was equivalent to the concentration of acetate measured. The carbonate
              |     concentrations calculated from these measurements were then used to calculate the
              |     saturation index of rhodochrosite.

text          |         The framework of our simulation is divided into a finite difference matrix
              | consisting of three cells representing two chambers separated by a permeable membrane
              | (representing the third cell). Dirichlet (fixed head) boundaries are set at both ends of the
              | three-cell domain to simulate a closed system. The heads within both chambers remain
              | identical at all times, therefore, there is no hydraulic gradient. Hence, hydraulic
              | conductivities are not applicable in this system, and transport is solely governed by
              | diffusion.
              |         The biogeochemical conceptual model of our system is summarized in Table 1 of
              | the main text, and can be divided into the following processes: 1) abiotic oxidation of
              | As(III) by birnessite (eq. 1-3), 2) reductive dissolution of birnessite (eq. 4), 3)
              | adsorption/desorption of As(V) and As(III) from goethite and birnessite (eq. 5-9).
              | Arsenic adsorption/desorption is described using a simple reversible equilibrium
              | expression formulated by Dzombeck and Morel (1) as described by Mayer et al. (2, 3).
              | The diffusion coefficient was calibrated to As concentrations measured in chambers over
              | time when As was injected in the absence of bacteria and birnessite.
              |         Within the birnessite chamber cell, abiotic As(III) oxidation was described
              | according to the general formulation:
