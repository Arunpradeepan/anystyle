title         | Abstract
text          |        Musculoskeletal models allow us to study muscle coordination and joint injuries
              | in ways that in vivo experiments cannot. Models and simulations can compute internal
              | joint contact forces, explore unsafe conditions, and simulate injuries without risk of
              | harming experimental subjects. Models also enable systematic variation of muscle
              | activity to evaluate its effect on joint loading and injury. The goals of this dissertation
              | were to systematically quantify the effects of varied muscle activity in three applications:
              | (1) to decrease knee forces during walking, (2) to estimate increased knee forces due to
              | crouch gait in subjects with cerebral palsy, and (3) to prevent ankle sprains during
              | landing.
              |        Muscles induce large forces in the tibiofemoral joint during walking and thereby
              | influence the health or degradation of tissues like articular cartilage and menisci. It is
              | possible to walk with a wide variety of muscle coordination patterns, but the effect of
              | varied muscle coordination on tibiofemoral contact forces remains unclear. The first goal
              | of this dissertation was to determine the effect of varied muscle coordination on
              | tibiofemoral contact forces. We developed a musculoskeletal model of a subject walking
              | with an instrumented knee implant. Using an optimization framework, we calculated the
              | tibiofemoral forces resulting from muscle coordination that reproduced the subject’s
              | walking dynamics. We performed a large set of optimizations in which we systematically
              | varied the coordination of muscles to determine the influence on tibiofemoral force. Peak
              | tibiofemoral forces during late stance could be reduced by increasing the activation of the
              | gluteus medius, uniarticular hip flexors, and soleus and by decreasing the activation of
              | the gastrocnemius and rectus femoris. These results suggest that retraining of muscle
              | coordination could substantially reduce tibiofemoral forces during late stance.
              |        Muscle coordination and the resulting tibiofemoral forces may vary dramatically
              | due to changes in walking kinematics, especially for individuals with gait pathologies.
              | Crouch gait, a common walking pattern in individuals with cerebral palsy, is
              | characterized by excessive flexion of the hip and knee. Many subjects with crouch gait
              | experience knee pain, perhaps because of elevated muscle forces and joint loading. The
              | second goal of this dissertation was to examine how compressive tibiofemoral force
              | change with the increasing knee flexion associated with crouch gait. Using our

meta          |                                                                                               v
text          | musculoskeletal model, muscle forces and tibiofemoral force were computed for three
              | unimpaired children and nine children with cerebral palsy who walked with varying
              | degrees of knee flexion. Compressive tibiofemoral force increased quadratically with
              | average stance phase knee flexion (i.e., crouch severity) during the stance phase of
              | walking, primarily due to concomitant increases in quadriceps forces. These results
              | revealed that walking in crouch generates increased knee loading which may contribute
              | to knee pain in individuals with crouch gait.
              |        Muscle coordination and pose are suspected causes and predictors of ankle
              | inversion sprains. Interventions that retrain muscle coordination have helped rehabilitate
              | injured ankles, but it is unclear which muscle coordination strategies, if any, can prevent
              | ankle sprains. The third goal of this dissertation was to determine whether coordinated
              | activity of the ankle muscles could prevent excessive ankle inversion during a simulated
              | landing on a 30–degree incline. We used musculoskeletal simulations to evaluate two
              | strategies for coordinating the ankle evertor and invertor muscles during simulated
              | landing scenarios: planned co-activation and stretch reflex activation with physiologic
              | latency (60-millisecond delay). Our simulations revealed that strong preparatory co-
              | activation of the ankle evertors and invertors prior to ground contact prevented ankle
              | inversion from exceeding injury thresholds by rapidly generating eversion moments after
              | initial contact. Conversely, stretch reflexes were too slow to generate eversion moments
              | before the simulations reached the threshold for inversion injury. These results suggest
              | that training interventions to protect the ankle should focus on stiffening the ankle with
              | muscle co-activation instead of increasing the speed or intensity of the evertor reflexes.
              |        This dissertation examines the effects of varied muscle coordination on two of the
              | most common musculoskeletal injuries: chronic degradation of the knee and acute ankle
              | inversion sprains. Our results revealed key connections between specific changes in
              | muscle coordination and improved function of the knee and ankle, suggesting exciting
              | future research areas for designing and testing interventions that protect knee and ankle
              | function. Additionally, this dissertation provides a computational foundation for
              | systematically exploring muscle coordination in musculoskeletal models, and provides
              | them, free and open source, to the broader research community.

text          |        Chronic knee degradation and acute ankle sprains occur at epidemic rates in
              | humans and result in permanent deficits in function and health. Approximately 14% of
              | Americans develop symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) at the knee (Losina et al., 2013) and
              | 12% experience ankle sprains during their lifetime (Doherty et al., 2014). These epidemic
              | injuries are heavily influence by the loads in joint tissues and the muscle forces which
              | generate them. For example, knee OA and pain have been linked to high tibiofemoral
              | loads during walking (Baliunas, 2002; Schnitzer et al., 1993; Sharma et al., 1998),
              | suggesting that changing the activity of muscles crossing the knee could decrease
              | tibiofemoral loads and delay the onset and progression of OA. Similarly, ankle instability
              | has been linked to slow or inactive ankle musculature, suggesting that increasing ankle
              | muscle activity may prevent many ankle sprains (Delahunt, 2007; Konradsen and Bohsen
              | Ravn, 1991; Löfvenberg et al., 1995). Therefor, delaying or even preventing chronic knee
              | degradation, acute ankle sprains, and potentially many more joint tissue injuries require
              | strategies for changing and optimizing muscle coordination to protect these tissues.
              | Discovering these coordination strategies is only possible if we can safely and
              | systematically control coordination and test the effect on the joints.
              |        In vivo measurement of muscle coordination and the resulting joint function is
              | difficult, invasive, and rarely done. Directly measuring muscle tensions requires invasive
              | procedures, such as severing tendons to install buckle transducers in living subjects
              | (Fukashiro et al., 1993; Gregor et al., 1991). Direct measurement of joint loads requires
              | implanting instrumented joint prostheses which measure the loads near the articulating
              | surfaces (Graichen et al., 2007; Kirking et al., 2006). While these techniques provide
              | valuable data, their invasiveness makes experiments on healthy individuals unethical,
              | limiting the size and diversity of subject cohorts. For example, in vivo knee loads have
              | been measured in fewer than 20 subjects, all of whom were middle aged or older and
              | already experienced joint degradation and surgery (Fregly et al., 2012; Kutzner et al.,
              | 2010). Similarly, systematic testing of in vivo ankle sprain mechanics is not possible
              | because inducing or risking injuries in healthy subjects would be unethical. To date,
              | experimental measurements of ankle mechanics are either restricted to conditions that are
              | far from the thresholds of injury (Chan et al., 2008; Gutierrez et al., 2012) or are

              | 1990). Therefore, systematic and comprehensive exploration of coordination strategies to
              | protect joints is impractical in vivo.
              |         Conversely, musculoskeletal models can quantify internal muscle and joint loads
              | (Delp et al., 2007; Sasaki and Neptune, 2010; Shelburne et al., 2005) and serve as a non-
              | invasive environment for inducing or mitigating joint injuries. Unlike in vivo
              | measurement of human subjects, computational models and simulations can explore
              | unsafe conditions and experience injury without risk. Musculoskeletal models can define
              | individual muscle activations and how they change throughout an activity, enabling fine
              | and systematic variation of muscle coordination. Therefore, it is feasible and practical to
              | use musculoskeletal models to experiment with coordination strategies and quantify the
              | effect on knee and ankle function. In the work presented in this dissertation, we
              | developed and used musculoskeletal models to propose and explore variations in
              | coordination that might improve the function and health of the knee and ankle joints.
              |         Musculoskeletal models for simulating full-body motion typically capture rigid
              | bone segments, joint kinematics, muscle geometry, and muscle dynamics. Researchers
              | often obtain skeletal geometry by dissecting and digitizing cadavers to yield bone
              | geometry (Delp et al., 1990) and the kinematics of articulating joints like the knee (Grood
              | et al., 1984; Walker et al., 1988) and ankle (Isman and Inman, 1969; Siegler et al., 1988).
              | Digitized cadaver geometry is also the most common source for muscle attachment
              | points, moment arms, and fiber architecture (Klein Horsman et al., 2007; Ward et al.,
              | 2009) used in musculoskeletal models (Arnold et al., 2010; Modenese et al., 2011). Bone,
              | joint, and muscle geometry can also be quantified through medical imaging. Magnetic
              | resonance imaging has been used to quantify muscle geometry and to validate and tune
              | muscle moment arms (Arnold et al., 2000) and muscle volumes (Handsfield et al., 2014)
              | in musculoskeletal models. Models of muscle architecture and dynamics capture the fiber
              | length and velocity dependencies of muscle’s force-generating capacity (Millard et al.,
              | 2013). In turn, the muscle force-generating capacity and skeletal geometry determine the
              | moment-generating capacity, or strength, of the whole musculoskeletal model. The
              | models described in this dissertation are based upon bone segments, joint kinematics, and
              | muscle geometry derived from cadavers (Delp et al., 1990).

text          |         Full-body musculoskeletal models have been used to estimate muscle and joint
              | forces during walking, but have not been used to their full capacity for varying muscle
              | activations and knee forces. Muscle activations that minimize effort or metabolic
              | expenditure during walking have been estimated in models and used to compute the
              | resulting knee forces (Sasaki and Neptune, 2010; Shelburne et al., 2005). Similar models
              | minimizing muscle activity have accurately estimated knee forces in walking subjects,
              | validated by in vivo knee forces measured in instrumented prostheses in the same
              | subjects (Kim et al., 2009; Walter et al., 2014). These and other previous works to date
              | (Winby et al., 2009) have primarily focused on accurately estimating the muscle forces
              | that occurred during measured walking experiments and analyzing the resulting knee
              | forces. However, the capacity to vary muscle activations and change the resulting knee
              | forces during walking remained largely unexplored until the work described in this
              | dissertation.
              |         In contrast to models of walking, musculoskeletal models of ankle sprains are
              | rare. Isolated models of the ankle have been developed to compute ankle ligament strains
              | during measured motions (Wei et al., 2011b), but these models exclude muscles and
              | ignore their capacity to protect the ankle (Wei et al., 2011a). Wright et al. used full-body,
              | muscle-driven simulations of sidestepping to demonstrate that neutral ankle posture
              | (Wright et al., 2000a) and increased passive ankle stiffness from braces or tape (Wright et
              | al., 2000b) could decrease the likelihood of ankle sprains. However, these simulations
              | only tested the effects of external stiffening. The effects of changes in muscle activity and
              | the capacity of the intrinsic ankle muscles to prevent ankle inversion injuries remained
              | unclear until the work described in this dissertation.

text          |         The goal of this dissertation was to quantify and identify coordination strategies
              | that might mitigate the most epidemic knee and ankle injuries by decreasing tibiofemoral
              | forces during walking or resisting ankle inversion during landing. We created three-
              | dimensional models of human walking and drop-landing which allowed us to probe and
              | control the internal muscle forces, joint kinematics, and joint forces during walking and
              | landings tasks. We used combinations of optimization and feedback control to

              | effects on tibiofemoral force during walking and ankle inversion during landing. We
              | found that changing the distribution of muscle forces during walking can dramatically
              | alter the tibiofemoral forces while still maintaining identical walking kinematics. We
              | identified the muscles with the greatest effect on increasing or decreasing the
              | tibiofemoral force and found that many influential muscles do not cross the knee. Next,
              | we fixed the distribution of muscle forces and systematically varied the degree of crouch
              | kinematics during walking. We found that increased degree of crouch requires larger
              | muscle forces and results in increased tibiofemoral forces during walking. The
              | compressive tibiofemoral forces increased quadratically with the degree of knee flexion
              | during stance (a measure of crouch severity), and individuals walking in severe crouch
              | experienced three-times the compressive tibiofemoral force of unimpaired individuals.
              | Finally, we used musculoskeletal simulations of landing under muscle feedback control
              | to induce ankle inversion injuries and test whether planned co-activation or unplanned

              | that planned co-activation at a sub-maximal level could rapidly generate protective forces
              | and prevent injury. Conversely, even the fastest known stretch reflexes (60 millisecond
              | latency) were too slow to resist the ankle injuries we simulated. These analyses identify
              | specific coordination strategies that change tibiofemoral forces and prevent ankle

title         | 1.3. Overview of this dissertation
text          |        This dissertation is composed of three research studies that are presented as self-
              | contained articles. Much of this work was performed in collaboration with others;
              | therefore, I use the pronoun “we” throughout the dissertation to refer to myself and my
              | coauthors. After this general introduction, Chapter 2 describes a three-dimensional
              | modeling and optimization framework for studying walking gait and an analysis
              | determining the changes in tibiofemoral forces due to variations in muscle activity. This
              | work was previously published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Research in collaboration
              | with my coauthors Saikat Pal and Scott Delp (DeMers et al., 2014). Chapter 3 describes
              | an analysis using a similar modeling and optimization framework to determine the
              | changes in tibiofemoral forces due to variations in knee flexion during walking in
              | unimpaired versus crouch gaits. This work was previously published in the journal Gait
              | & Posture in collaboration with my coauthors Katherine Steele and Scott Delp (Steele et
              | al., 2012). Chapter 4 describes a landing model with foot-floor contact, passive ankle
              | moments representing ligaments, and novel muscle feedback controllers as well as a
              | battery of landing simulations that test the efficacy of two ankle coordination strategies
              | for preventing ankle injury. This work has been submitted for peer review in

title         | 2.1. Introduction
text          |        The knee experiences large mechanical loads during activities of daily living.
              | Walking, for example, induces forces as large as three bodyweights at the knee (Fregly et
              | al., 2012; Kutzner et al., 2010). These loads affect the development, maintenance, and
              | health of the joint tissues (Carter and Wong, 1988). The onset and progression of
              | osteoarthritis can be associated with large loads at the knee (Baliunas, 2002; Sharma et
              | al., 1998), and increased knee loads have been linked to pain in patients with
              | osteoarthritis (Schnitzer et al., 1993). Since tibiofemoral loads during walking are
              | produced primarily by muscle forces (Sasaki and Neptune, 2010; Shelburne et al., 2006),
              | muscle coordination plays a pivotal role in determining tibiofemoral loads. Identifying
              | muscle coordination patterns that alter tibiofemoral loads may assist in the design of
              | rehabilitation programs to restore and maintain the health of the knee.
              |        Training and rehabilitation programs can reduce tibiofemoral loads during
              | walking by alteration of gait kinematics. Fregly et al. demonstrated that adopting a
              | “medial thrust” gait reduced medial compartment forces measured in vivo using
              | instrumented knee replacements (Fregly et al., 2009). Strategies altering foot progression
              | angle and medio-lateral foot placement during the stance phase of walking reduce the net
              | knee adduction moment (Chang et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2007; Shull et al., 2011) and knee
              | pain (Shull et al., 2013). Exaggerated trunk sway in the medio-lateral direction during
              | walking can reduce net knee adduction moments (Mündermann et al., 2008a). While
              | previous work demonstrates that altering gait kinematics can reduce knee loads during
              | walking, the effects of altered muscle coordination on tibiofemoral loads remain unclear.
              |        Studying the effects of altered muscle coordination on tibiofemoral loads is
              | challenging. Direct measurement of tibiofemoral loads during walking requires
              | implanting instrumented knee prostheses in living subjects (D’Lima et al., 2005; Fregly et
              | al., 2012; Kutzner et al., 2010). This technique provides valuable data, but is highly
              | invasive, making measurement of tibiofemoral loads impractical in healthy subjects and
              | limiting the number of subjects in which knee loads can be measured. An alternative to

              | Model-based studies have estimated tibiofemoral loads using a variety of muscle
              | coordination strategies, including minimizing muscle activity (Sritharan et al., 2012;
              | Steele et al., 2012), muscle stress (Glitsch and Baumann, 1997), or energy consumption
              | (Shelburne et al., 2005). Previous studies have determined a single set of muscle forces
              | during walking and the resulting tibiofemoral loads, but the changes in tibiofemoral loads
              | arising from variations in muscle activations remains unknown.
              |        The purpose of this study was to determine the changes in tibiofemoral forces due
              | to variations in muscle activation patterns. We first evaluated whether a commonly
              | assumed muscle coordination strategy, minimizing the sum of muscle activations
              | squared, Thelen et al. (2003) produced tibiofemoral forces that were consistent with in
              | vivo measurements. We next determined the potential for a subject to decrease
              | tibiofemoral forces during walking by adopting a muscle coordination strategy that
              | minimized tibiofemoral forces. Finally, we determined the changes in tibiofemoral forces
              | due to varied activations of individual muscles of the lower limb and identified the
              | muscles with the greatest potential to alter tibiofemoral loading.

title         | 2.2.1. Human Subject Data
text          |        We used walking data of a subject implanted with an instrumented total knee
              | replacement (TKR). These data are available from the ASME Grand Challenge
              | Project(Fregly et al., 2012). The subject (83 year old male, 64 kg, 166 cm tall) had
              | received bilateral TKR. The right TKR was instrumented to measure tibiofemoral forces
              | normal to the tibial plateau (D’Lima et al., 2005). The data include three-dimensional
              | marker positions, ground reaction forces, and tibiofemoral forces measured
              | simultaneously during walking at the subject’s self-selected speed (1.3 m/s).

title         | 2.2.2. OpenSim Model
text          |        We created a full-body gait model in OpenSim (Delp et al., 2007) to analyze knee
              | loads. The 10 segment, 19 degree of freedom (dof) model (Figure 2.1 A) was adapted
              | from a musculoskeletal model of the lower limb published by Delp et al. (1990) (Figure
blank         | 
meta          | 8
text          | 2.1 A). The model was driven by 92 muscle-tendon actuators (Thelen et al., 2003) that
              | captured force-length-velocity properties, with muscle geometry and architecture based
              | on adult cadaver data (Delp et al., 1990). A ball-and-socket joint connected the torso to
              | the pelvis. The right and left lower limbs consisted of a ball-and-socket hip joint, a
              | revolute ankle joint, and a coupled knee mechanism (1 dof) with translations of the tibia
              | and patella prescribed by the knee flexion angle. We refined the knee mechanism of the
              | generic model so that the patella articulated with the femur, and the quadriceps wrapped
              | around the patella before attaching to the tibial tuberosity (Figure 2.1 B). The patella
              | functioned as a frictionless pulley that redirected the quadriceps forces to act along the
              | line of action of the patellar ligament. This refined knee mechanism reproduced the
              | patellofemoral kinematics in Delp et al. (1990) and enabled resultant tibiofemoral forces
              | to be computed.

              | instrumented subject. All joint kinematics, muscle attachments, and the resulting muscle
              | moment arms were scaled to match the segment lengths of the subject. Additionally, the
              | optimal fiber length and tendon slack length of each muscle were scaled according to the
              | muscle’s total change in muscle-tendon length. Other muscle parameters, including peak
              | isometric forces and pennation angles, were not altered. We determined joint kinematics
              | for five trials of normal walking by minimizing error between the experimentally
              | measured marker positions and the corresponding markers on the model. A residual
              | reduction algorithm (Delp et al., 2007) adjusted the model mass properties and joint
              | kinematics for each trial to ensure that the ground reaction forces and body segment
              | accelerations were dynamically consistent. After residual reduction the model segment
              | masses differed by less than 2% from the scaled model, and the resulting joint kinematics
              | differed by less than 2 degrees from the kinematics tracked by the residual reduction

text          |         To investigate the change in tibiofemoral forces due to varied activation of a
              | muscle, we performed two static optimizations for each trial of normal walking. First, to
              | prohibit activation of a particular muscle, we performed a static optimization with w =
              | 100 for that muscle while w for all other muscles was held at 1. Second, to promote
              | activation of a particular muscle, we performed a static optimization with w = 0 for that
              | muscle while w for all other muscles was held at 1. Performing two static optimizations
              | for each muscle of the lower limb determined the range of tibiofemoral forces due to
              | varying activation of that muscle. We determined the change in peak tibiofemoral force
              | due to activation of a muscle by calculating the difference between peak tibiofemoral
              | forces obtained from the static optimizations with w = 0 and w = 100.
              |         Our methods produced similar joint moments, muscle activations, and
              | tibiofemoral forces for all five walking trials; thus, we have included results from one
              | representative trial for clarity.

text          |         A muscle coordination strategy that minimized muscle activations produced
              | greater tibiofemoral forces than forces measured in vivo (Figure 2.2). During late stance
              | (33-66% gait), a muscle coordination strategy that minimized the sum of muscle
              | activations squared produced a peak tibiofemoral force that was 1.7 bodyweights larger
              | than the peak force measured in vivo. This difference was less pronounced during early
              | stance (0-33% gait), when minimizing muscle activations squared produced a peak
              | tibiofemoral force that was 0.4 bodyweights larger than the peak force measured in vivo.
              | During the swing phase (not shown), differences between the model-predicted and
              | measured forces were less than 0.2 bodyweights.
              |         A muscle coordination strategy that minimized tibiofemoral forces produced
              | lower model-predicted forces than forces measured in vivo (Figure 2.2). During late
              | stance, a muscle coordination strategy that minimized tibiofemoral force produced a peak
              | model-predicted force that was 1.5 bodyweights lower than the peak force measured in
              | vivo. During early stance, this strategy produced a peak tibiofemoral force that was
              | similar to the peak force measured in vivo.

title         | 2.4. Discussion
text          |        Our results demonstrate that altering muscle activation patterns during walking
              | can induce large changes in compressive forces at the tibiofemoral joint. Tibiofemoral
              | forces were sensitive to activations of a small subset of lower limb muscles, including the
              | gluteus medius, gastrocnemius, and rectus femoris, indicating that these muscles have the
              | greatest potential to affect knee loading. This suggests that interventions aimed at
              | retraining muscle coordination should target these muscles to reduce tibiofemoral loads.
              |        Our first goal was to evaluate whether a strategy minimizing the sum of muscle
              | activations squared produced tibiofemoral forces that were consistent with in vivo
              | measurements. When adopting this strategy, our model over-predicted tibiofemoral
              | forces during the late stance phase. The discrepancy was due to over-activity of the rectus
              | femoris and gastrocnemius, which were the largest contributors to the over-predicted
              | tibiofemoral force. The model activated the rectus femoris during late stance, while
              | electromyography (EMG) measured from the subject suggest that the rectus femoris may
              | have been inactive at this time (Figure 2.5). Similarly, the strategy minimizing muscle
              | activations squared activated the gastrocnemius earlier and more than the soleus;
              | however, EMG data show that the subject activated the gastrocnemius and soleus
              | muscles equitably during late stance. Optimization objectives that penalized activity of
              | the rectus femoris and gastrocnemius produced lower tibiofemoral forces that better
              | matched in vivo measurements.
              |        Our second goal was to determine the potential for a subject to decrease
              | tibiofemoral forces during walking by altering muscle coordination. Our model achieved
              | tibiofemoral forces that were lower than in vivo measurements during late stance by
              | adopting different muscle activation patterns compared to the TKR subject (Figure 2.2).
              | For example, the model minimized tibiofemoral forces by deactivating the gastrocnemius
              | and hamstrings during late stance, whereas the TKR subject activated these muscles

              | stance.

text          |        Increasing the activation of gluteus medius, a muscle crossing the hip, had the
              | greatest potential to reduce tibiofemoral forces during walking. The gluteus medius
              | produced the largest hip abduction moment throughout the stance phase of walking. In
              | our simulations, increased activation of the gluteus medius resulted in a compensatory
              | decrease in activation of the rectus femoris, tensor fasciae latae, and sartorius muscles to
              | maintain the required hip abduction moment. The decrease in activations of the rectus
              | femoris muscle in turn resulted in a compensatory decrease in activations of the
              | gastrocnemius and biceps femoris short head muscles to maintain net knee moments.
              | These decreased activations of the rectus femoris, gastrocnemius, and biceps femoris
              | short head muscles resulted in decreased tibiofemoral forces. Conversely, decreasing
              | activations of the gluteus medius muscle increased activations of the rectus femoris,
              | gastrocnemius, and biceps femoris short head muscles, thereby increasing tibiofemoral
              | forces. Thus, while the gluteus medius does not cross the knee, changes in activity or
              | forces generated by this muscle produce substantial compensations from other muscles
              | and have a potent effect on tibiofemoral forces. Our results may seem inconsistent with
              | studies that have reported minimal contributions of the gluteus medius to tibiofemoral
              | force (Sasaki and Neptune, 2010; Sritharan et al., 2012); however, these studies reported
              | the contributions of individual muscles to tibiofemoral force based on a single muscle
              | activation pattern and did not account for compensatory muscle activity. In contrast, we
              | selectively changed activations of individual muscles and allowed other muscle
              | activations to compensate to reproduce the walking motion.
              |        Increasing the activation of the gastrocnemius and rectus femoris, two biarticular
              | muscles crossing the knee, had the greatest potential to increase tibiofemoral forces
              | during the late stance phase of walking. In addition to generating moments about the
              | knee, the gastrocnemius and rectus femoris muscles produce ankle plantarflexion and hip
              | flexion moments, respectively, in preparation for swinging the leg. During late stance,
              | increased activation of the gastrocnemius generated a large knee flexion moment, causing
              | compensatory co-activation of the rectus femoris to balance the net knee moment.
              | Conversely, increased activation of the rectus femoris generated a knee extension
              | moment, causing compensatory co-activation of the gastrocnemius and biceps femoris

              | head increased tibiofemoral forces. Previous studies have shown that the gastrocnemius
              | and rectus femoris muscles contribute a higher proportion of the tibiofemoral force than
              | the soleus and the uniarticular hip flexors (Sasaki and Neptune, 2010; Sritharan et al.,
              | 2012). Sasaki and Neptune (2010) postulated that decreasing activations of the biarticular
              | knee muscles may decrease tibiofemoral loading; our results support this idea. We also
              | found that promoting activations of the soleus and uniarticular hip flexors could reduce
              | tibiofemoral force. These results suggest that training to strengthen and activate the
              | soleus and uniarticular hip flexors may decrease tibiofemoral forces and associated knee
              | pain.
              |         Tibiofemoral forces were most sensitive to muscle activations during the late
              | stance phase of walking. During late stance, net knee flexion-extension moments are
              | small compared to early stance (Liu et al., 2008; McClelland et al., 2010). Low net knee
              | flexion-extension moments during late stance allow a large range of muscle activations
              | while still reproducing the measured walking motion. Since minimal muscle forces are
              | required to generate the low net knee moments, the model can minimally activate
              | muscles crossing the knee, especially the quadriceps (Figure 2.5). However, the model
              | can also co-activate the knee muscles, using a large portion of their force-generating
              | capacity to generate co-contraction. This permits substantial freedom to vary muscle
              | activations and tibiofemoral forces during late stance without altering the walking
              | motion. In contrast, larger knee extension moments during early stance demand larger
              | activations of the knee extensors. Therefore, muscle activations that reproduce walking
              | are constrained to a narrow range, allowing only small variations in tibiofemoral forces
              | during early stance.
              |         A limitation of this study was that we used walking kinematics measured from
              | one subject with bilateral TKR, and it is unclear if this dataset adequately represents a
              | healthy or osteoarthritic population with intact knees. Subjects with TKR have been
              | shown to walk with a straighter leg and reduced knee moments during stance (Bolanos et

              | tibiofemoral loading. In our case, the TKR subject displayed stance phase knee moments

              | al., 2008; McClelland et al., 2010; Pandy et al., 2010); in comparison, our TKR subject
              | generated peak knee moments of 4% bodyweight times height. The knee moments were
              | similar across five walking trials; hence, our reported results from a single trial are
              | representative of the remaining four normal walking trials. A second limitation of this
              | study was that our simplified tibiofemoral joint did not permit knee abduction-adduction
              | or internal-external rotation. Including these degrees of freedom would require the knee
              | muscles to balance net moments in these directions. We speculate that producing these
              | moments would increase muscle activations and tibiofemoral forces reported in this
              | study. Tibiofemoral forces also depend on muscle geometry and strength; therefore,
              | changes in the model’s muscle attachments and architecture would affect the reported
              | results as well. A fourth limitation was that we permitted all muscles to activate
              | independently. This may result in compensatory muscle coordination strategies that may
              | be physiologically difficult for a patient to adopt. For example, a patient may have
              | difficulty activating the soleus without activating the gastrocnemius. Finally, we
              | calculated muscle activations that did not cause kinematic compensations (i.e., walking
              | dynamics were unchanged when muscle activations were varied). Other studies have
              | demonstrated that altered walking kinematics also decrease tibiofemoral loads (Fregly et
              | al., 2009; Shull et al., 2013, 2011). Permitting walking kinematics to change along with
              | muscle activations will likely result in greater reductions in tibiofemoral forces than those
              | reported here.

title         | 2.5. Conclusion
text          |        This study identified muscles that substantially affect tibiofemoral forces during
              | walking. Interestingly, inactivity or weakness in the muscles crossing the hip and ankle
              | joints can affect the loads of the knee joint. Increased activation and force in the gluteus
              | medius, psoas major, iliacus, and soleus muscles may decrease tibiofemoral forces.
              | Decreased activation of the gastrocnemius and rectus femoris muscles can also decrease
              | tibiofemoral forces. Training programs targeting knee rehabilitation should include
              | exercises that strengthen and activate the gluteus medius, psoas, and soleus muscles. It

blank         | 
title         | 3.1. Introduction
text          |        Crouch gait is a common pathological walking pattern adopted by individuals
              | with cerebral palsy that is characterized by excessive hip and knee flexion. Walking in a
              | crouched posture is inefficient (Rose et al., 1989; Waters and Mulroy, 1999) and can lead
              | to joint pain and compromise an individual’s walking ability (Opheim et al., 2009).
              | Surgical and therapeutic treatments for crouch gait aim to produce a more upright posture
              | to improve walking efficiency and prevent joint pain and deterioration.
              |        Altered loads on the knee can have adverse effects on joint health. Cartilage and
              | bone growth and maintenance depend on the loads experienced during daily life (Carter
              | and Wong, 1988; Wong and Carter, 2003), and abnormal loading can lead to joint pain,
              | cartilage degeneration (Eckstein et al., 2002), and the formation of bone deformities
              | (Kerr Graham and Selber, 2003). Joint pain can be a significant contributor to walking
              | deterioration in adults with cerebral palsy. Jahnsen et al. (2004) found that 41% of adults
              | with diplegic cerebral palsy reported significant knee pain.
              |        To develop successful treatment strategies for crouch gait, surgeons and therapists
              | need to understand how joint loads change with increasing knee flexion during crouch
              | gait and how joint loads may change with altered knee flexion. Treatments are aimed at
              | reducing the excessive knee flexion associated with crouch gait, but it is unclear if
              | changes in knee flexion will alter joint loads. Quantifying the relationship between knee
              | flexion, muscle forces, and the compressive force on the tibia during gait could help
              | clinicians determine if a more upright posture could reduce the risks caused by altered
              | joint loading.
              |        Perry and colleagues examined knee forces in a static crouched posture using a
              | cadaver model and reported increasing compressive tibiofemoral force with increasing
              | knee flexion (Perry et al., 1975). In dynamic activities, such as walking, we expect larger
              | joint forces than in a static posture due to the additional muscle forces required to support
              | the body weight during movement and propel the body forward (Liu et al., 2008).
              | Compressive tibiofemoral forces during unimpaired walking have been reported in the
              | range of 2-3 times body-weight (D’Lima et al., 2006; Kutzner et al., 2010; Mündermann
blank         | 
meta          |                                                                                           23
text          | et al., 2008b; Shelburne et al., 2005). During crouch gait, muscle forces in the stance-
              | limb are higher than during unimpaired walking (Steele et al., 2010). Since muscle forces
              | are the primary contributors to joint loading (Inman, 1947; Sasaki and Neptune, 2010),
              | we expect that compressive tibiofemoral forces are higher during crouch gait, yet the
              | relationship between crouch gait severity and the compressive tibiofemoral force remains
              | unknown.
              |        The purpose of this study was to estimate the magnitude of the compressive
              | tibiofemoral force during crouch gait and examine how this force changes with crouch
              | severity. To achieve this goal we estimated the muscles forces and the compressive force
              | on the tibia in unimpaired children and children with cerebral palsy who walked in
              | varying degrees of crouch severity. We used a freely-available biomechanics software
              | package, OpenSim (Delp et al., 2007), to scale a musculoskeletal model to each
              | individual and estimate muscle joint loads based upon each individual’s gait dynamics.

text          |        The subjects for this study were selected from a database of patients treated at
              | Gillette Children’s Specialty Healthcare (St. Paul, MN; Table 3.1). Nine subjects with
              | spastic diplegic cerebral palsy were selected to cover a broad range of crouch severity
              | and were divided evenly into three groups: mild crouch gait (minimum knee flexion
              | angle of 20-35º), moderate crouch gait (minimum knee flexion angle of 35-50º), and
              | severe crouch gait (minimum knee flexion angle greater than 50º). All subjects walked
              | with excess knee and hip flexion and had at least 5º of ankle dorsiflexion during stance.
              | We excluded subjects that had greater than 30º of femoral or tibial torsion, which can
              | affect muscle moment arms and the ability of muscles to generate accelerations (Hicks et
              | al., 2008). Three unimpaired subjects were chosen who were representative of the age
              | and stature of the subjects with cerebral palsy. Additionally, a subject with an
              | instrumented total knee replacement (TKR, age: 80 years, weight: 64 kg, walking
              | speed/height: 0.74 s-1) was included to provide experimental measurements of the
              | compressive tibiofemoral force for comparison with forces estimated from the
              | musculoskeletal model. This subject was not included in subsequent comparisons

text          |          Motion analysis data was collected at Gillette Children’s Specialty Healthcare (St.
              | Paul, MN) using a 12-camera system (Vicon Motion Systems, Lake Forest, CA), four
              | force plates (AMTI, Watertown, MA), and a standard marker protocol (Davis et al.,
              | 1991). Ground reaction forces and moments were sampled at 1080 Hz and low-pass
              | filtered at 20 Hz. Electromyography (EMG) was collected for six of the crouch gait
              | subjects from the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius (Motion Laboratory
              | Systems, Baton Rouge, LA). The EMG data was sampled at 1080 Hz, band-pass filtered
              | between 20 and 400 Hz, rectified, and low-pass filtered at 10 Hz. All subjects walked at
              | their self-selected speed and achieved two consecutive force plate strikes during which
              | only one foot contacted each force plate. The motion analysis data for the subject with the
              | instrumented TKR was obtained from www.simtk.org where it is freely available for

              | al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008; Reinbolt et al., 2008). The degrees of freedom in the
              | musculoskeletal model included six degrees of freedom at the pelvis, a ball-and-socket
              | joint at the third lumbar vertebra between the pelvis and torso, a ball-and-socket joint at
              | each hip, a planar joint with coupled translations at each knee (Yamaguchi and Zajac,
              | 1989), and a revolute joint at each ankle. Joint angles during walking were calculated by
              | minimizing the error between experimental marker trajectories and markers placed on the
              | model at locations corresponding to the experimental markers.
              |        Static optimization was used to calculate the muscle forces required to reproduce

              | tibia and used for all subsequent analyses.
              |        For the subject with the instrumented TKR, we varied the static optimization
              | weighting constants for the major muscle groups that cross the knee: the hamstrings,
              | gastrocnemius, and quadriceps. The hamstrings included independent muscle models for
              | the semimembranosus, semitendinousus, biceps femoris long head, and biceps femoris
              | short head. The quadriceps included independent muscle models for the rectus femoris,
              | the vastus medialis, the vastus intermedius, and the vastus lateralis. The same weighting
              | constant was applied to all muscles in each group and the results for the muscles within
              | each group were compared and, if found to be similar, were combined to facilitate
              | analysis. The weighting constants were given integer values between one and ten. We
              | performed static optimization for all combinations of integer weighting constants and
              | calculated the resulting compressive tibiofemoral force. The peak compressive force was
              | compared to the experimentally measured force, and we selected the combination of
              | weighting constants that had the minimum average value and resulted in a difference
              | between the estimated and experimental peak compressive force of less than twenty
              | percent body-weight. The set of weighting constants that met this criterion was a weight
              | of three for the hamstrings, seven for the gastrocnemius, and one for the quadriceps. This
              | combination of weighting constants resulted in a root mean square error of 0.28 times
              | body-weight and an average error of 0.02 times body-weight over the gait cycle between
              | the estimated force and the experimental measurements (Figure 3.1). These weighting
              | constants were then used to perform static optimization for all other subjects. OpenSim’s
              | Joint Reaction analysis algorithm was used to calculate the compressive tibiofemoral
              | force for one representative gait cycle for each subject.

text          |        Compressive tibiofemoral force was higher during moderate and severe crouch
              | gait than during unimpaired gait (Figure 3.3). Subjects with a mild crouch gait had
              | similar compressive tibiofemoral forces to subjects with unimpaired gait. The maximum
              | force during mild crouch gait was 3.2 ±0.4 times body-weight compared to 3.0 ±0.5 times
              | body-weight during unimpaired gait. Maximum force during a moderate crouch gait was
              | 4.2 ±1.2 times body-weight. During a severe crouch gait maximum force was 6.5 ±0.7
              | times body-weight.
              |        Compressive tibiofemoral force during stance exhibited two peaks in unimpaired
              | and crouch gait (Figure 3.3B). These two peaks in the tibiofemoral force coincided with
              | the two characteristic peaks of the ground reaction force. The largest tibiofemoral forces
              | occurred during early and late stance with smaller forces in mid-stance and swing. During
              | unimpaired gait, the primary contributors to compressive tibiofemoral force were the
              | quadriceps in early stance and the gastrocnemius during late stance. During crouch gait,
              | the quadriceps were the primary contributors to tibiofemoral force throughout stance
              | (Figure 3.3C).
              |        There was a quadratic relationship between the average knee flexion angle during
              | stance and the average compressive tibiofemoral force during stance (r2 = 0.97, Figure
              | 3.4). The relationship is described by:
              |                            3^)// = 0.0013d ( − 0.06d + 2.54                   Equation 3.3
              | where Fknee is the average compressive tibiofemoral force during stance, and Ө is the
              | average knee flexion angle during stance with values from 15 to 70 degrees of flexion.
              |        The increase in average compressive tibiofemoral force during stance with
              | increasing crouch severity was primarily due to an increase in quadriceps force. The
              | average quadriceps force during stance also increased quadratically with knee flexion
              | angle (r2=0.99, Figure 3.4) with the relationship:
              |                              3e+Cf = 0.0011d ( − 0.03d + 0.7                  Equation 3.4
              |        The average force produced by the hamstrings during stance did not change with
              | knee flexion; however, the average force of gastrocnemius decreased with crouch
              | severity. Individuals with crouch gait had smaller ankle plantarflexor moments during
              | terminal stance.

title         | 3.2. Discussion
text          |               Individuals who walk in a moderate or severe crouch gait experience substantially
              | greater compressive tibiofemoral forces than individuals with an unimpaired gait;
              | however, individuals who walk in a mild crouch gait have similar compressive
              | tibiofemoral forces to unimpaired gait. The increase in tibiofemoral force was primarily
              | due to the increase in quadriceps force required to support the body during crouch gait.
              | There was a quadratic increase in quadriceps force with increasing knee flexion which is
              | similar to a reported quadratic increase in EMG magnitude in static, crouch postures (Hsu
meta          | 32
text          | et al., 1993). The increase in quadriceps force with crouch severity not only contributes to
              | increased tibiofemoral load but would also increase patellofemoral load (Dhaher and
              | Kahn, 2002) and may give rise to knee pain in individuals with cerebral palsy and crouch
              | gait. To reduce the average compressive tibiofemoral force and quadriceps force during
              | stance to within one standard deviation of the average during unimpaired gait, individuals
              | with crouch gait need to achieve an average knee flexion angle less than 25 degrees
              | during stance.
              |        Compressive tibiofemoral force during crouch gait reported here are slightly
              | higher than those estimated by Perry et al. (1975), who used statically loaded cadavers in
              | a crouch posture. Perry determined the compressive tibiofemoral force at 30 and 45
              | degrees of knee flexion to be 2.9 and 3.8 times body-weight, respectively, whereas we
              | found the maximum force during a crouch gait with an average knee flexion angle of 30
              | and 45 degrees to be 3.3 and 4.1 times body-weight. The static cadaver testing
              | implemented by Perry did not include contributions from the gastrocnemius or hamstring
              | muscles to compressive tibiofemoral force. The small difference in compressive
              | tibiofemoral force between standing and walking demonstrates that, although walking
              | requires additional muscle force to propel the body forward (Steele et al., 2010), the
              | increased quadriceps demand arising from a static crouched posture accounts for the
              | majority of the increased tibiofemoral force. The tibiofemoral contact force of the
              | unimpaired children included in this analysis were also similar to previously reported
              | results for adults (D’Lima et al., 2006; Kutzner et al., 2010; Mündermann et al., 2008b;
              | Shelburne et al., 2005).
              |        Our calculation of compressive tibiofemoral force depends on the accuracy of
              | estimated muscle activations. The estimated muscle activations showed patterns similar
              | to EMG such as increased activity of the quadriceps; however, EMG activity was
              | available for a limited number of muscles in six of the subjects. When muscle activations
              | differed from the EMG signals the optimization tended to underestimate muscle activity
              | compared to EMG signals. This suggests that the optimization functions commonly used
              | for unimpaired walking may not be appropriate for individuals with cerebral palsy who
              | have altered motor control and muscle physiology. Muscle over-activity and excess co-
              | contraction are common in individuals with cerebral palsy. Greater muscle forces due to

text          | co-contraction would increase the estimated tibiofemoral contact forces suggesting that
              | our calculations of compressive tibiofemoral force may be low estimates.
              |        We compared our calculated tibiofemoral forces to experimental forces from an
              | instrumented total knee replacement, but this did not provide a robust evaluation of knee
              | forces during crouch gait. The total knee replacement data was used to select the static
              | optimization weighting constants that reduced the error between the estimated and
              | measured compressive tibiofemoral force. Different weighting constants may be
              | appropriate for younger patients or patients with gait pathology. In this study, the
              | weighting constants penalized recruitment of the hamstrings and gastrocnemius, which
              | resulted in the recruitment of other muscles to actuate the hip and ankle without
              | increasing the compressive load on the tibia. Although the quadriceps are the major
              | contributors to compressive tibiofemoral force, increasing the quadriceps’ weighting
              | constant did not reduce the estimated tibiofemoral force since no other muscles could
              | replace the quadriceps’ function at the knee.
              |        To test the sensitivity of our results to the objective function we evaluated how
              | estimated tibiofemoral contact force changed with altering the weighting constants and
              | the power of activation. The quadratic relationship between knee flexion angle and
              | tibiofemoral contact force and quadriceps force was similar in all tested objective
              | functions (Figure 3.5). Using a linear objective function resulted in an average reduction
              | in tibiofemoral contact force during stance of 7 percent while an objective function that
              | minimized activation cubed increased tibiofemoral contact force during stance by 11
              | percent. Using weighting constants of one for all muscles also increased the estimated
              | tibiofemoral contact force during stance by an average of 15 percent due primarily to a
              | ten percent average increase in gastrocnemius force during stance. Future studies that
              | measure compressive tibiofemoral force from individuals with instrumented total knee
              | replacements walking in pathologic gait patterns, such as crouch gait, could provide
              | further points of comparison for model-based estimates of compressive tibiofemoral force
              | and help to determine the optimal objective functions.

title         | 4.1. Introduction
text          |        Ankle sprains are the most common of all acute musculoskeletal injuries that
              | occur during physical activity (Fong et al., 2009, 2007). Roughly 80% of acute ankle
              | injuries involve excessive inversion, with 77% resulting in sprains of the lateral ligaments
              | (Fong et al., 2009). These injuries often occur during landing, especially on irregular or
              | unexpected surfaces, such as a competitor’s foot (Bahr et al., 1997, 1994). High impact
              | forces directed medially to the subtalar joint induce rapid inversion of the foot (Fuller,
              | 1999; Wright et al., 2000a, 2000b). Injury occurs when excessive ankle inversion
              | stretches the lateral ankle ligaments that cross the talocrural and subtalar joints, causing
              | plastic strains or ligament rupture (Hertel, 2002). Such injuries result in long, incomplete
              | recoveries that leave the ankle prone to recurring injuries.
              |        Load–deflection studies on cadavers have quantified the passive mechanics of the
              | ankle (Chen et al., 1988; Lapointe et al., 1997; Siegler et al., 1990). Passive ankle
              | stiffness decreases due to lateral ligament sprains, reducing resistance to excessive ankle
              | inversion (Lapointe et al., 1997; Siegler et al., 1990). Computer simulations of ankle
              | inversion scenarios predicted that decreased passive ankle stiffness could increase the
              | probability of inversion injuries (Wright et al., 2000b). Observations from large cohorts
              | of athletes corroborate this finding, showing that ankles with previous inversion injuries
              | are more susceptible to future injury than uninjured ankles (McGuine and Keene, 2006;
              | Surve et al., 1994). Athletic tape and braces can reinforce and stiffen ankles with
              | previous injuries and decrease rates of recurring injuries (Kamiya et al., 2009); however,
              | tape and braces have not been shown to decrease injury rates in uninjured ankles
              | (Calatayud et al., 2014; Verhagen and Bay, 2010).
              |        Posture and muscle coordination may also affect ankle stability, but the
              | relationships between muscle activity, landing pose, and the risk of inversion injury have
              | not been adequately characterized. Landing with a plantarflexed or inverted ankle
              | increased the rate of injury in musculoskeletal simulations (Wright et al., 2000a), while
              | retraining trunk and leg posture has decreased the rate of ankle injuries in volleyball

              | have also been shown to protect the ankle. For example, balance board training, in which
              | the participant stands with one foot on an unstable surface, has decreased the rates of
              | recurring ankle injuries in previously injured ankles (Bahr et al., 1997; Verhagen et al.,
              | 2004). Similarly, interventions combining balance, strength, and plyometric training have
              | decreased the rates of recurring ankle injuries (Emery and Meeuwisse, 2010). However,
              | according to multiple reviews (Calatayud et al., 2014; van der Wees et al., 2006;
              | Verhagen and Bay, 2010), the majority of studies have found no effect of neuromotor
              | retraining on preventing first-time ankle sprains.
              |        While studies of neuromotor retraining show promising results, outcomes are
              | mixed and the underlying mechanisms behind the protective effects are unknown, largely
              | because the role of the ankle muscles in resisting inversion sprains is an area of
              | controversy. Some hypothesize that improved ankle proprioception (Arnold et al., 2009a;
              | Hertel, 2002, 2000; Munn et al., 2010) and increased strength in the ankle evertor
              | muscles (Arnold et al., 2009b) are responsible. However, experiments exploring the
              | effects of balance interventions found that neuromuscular retraining neither targets nor
              | improves ankle proprioception (Gauffin et al., 1988; Kiers et al., 2012). Additionally,
              | patients with recurring ankle sprains (Hiller et al., 2011) or functional ankle instability
              | (Munn et al., 2003) do not demonstrate deficits in evertor strength, although patients with
              | ankle instability or recent ankle sprains may exhibit longer evertor muscle reaction times
              | (Delahunt, 2007; Konradsen and Ravn, 1990; Löfvenberg et al., 1995). These findings
              | suggest that changes in muscle coordination may be the primary protective mechanism of
              | neuromuscular retraining. However, the capacity for the ankle muscles to prevent
              | inversion injuries under various coordination strategies remains largely unexplored.
              |        The purpose of this study was to determine whether coordinated activity of the
              | ankle muscles could prevent excessive ankle inversion during an inversion-inducing
              | landing scenario. We used musculoskeletal simulations to avoid the risk of injuring
              | human subjects and to allow for systematic manipulation of muscle coordination. We

title         | 4.2.1. A new musculoskeletal model for simulating ankle inversion injuries
text          |        We developed a model (Figure 4.1) for simulating single-leg landings in OpenSim
              | (Delp et al., 2007) by augmenting a well-established full-body musculoskeletal model.
              | The model used the musculoskeletal geometry of the lower limb defined by Delp et al.
              | (1990) with an articulating patella and quadriceps (DeMers et al., 2014). The model
              | incorporated a lumped torso–head segment connected to the pelvis by a ball-and-socket
              | joint. The arms connected to the torso with ball-and-socket shoulder joints (Hamner et al.,
              | 2010). Forty-nine muscle–tendon units (muscles) actuated the legs and the lumbar joint
              | (21 degrees of freedom in total). All muscles incorporated force–length, force–velocity,
              | and activation dynamics behavior described by Thelen (2003) and implemented in
              | OpenSim by Millard et al. (2013). The ankle evertor muscles included the three peronei
              | and extensor digitorum muscles. The ankle invertor muscles included the tibialis anterior,
              | tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum, flexor hallucis, and extensor hallucis. Excitations of
              | the model’s muscles were determined either by feedforward controllers or by stretch
              | feedback controllers, as described below.
              |        To represent the landing surface, the simulation included a contact plane, fixed to
              | a configurable platform, which could be set at any desired height and orientation below
              | the musculoskeletal model. This contact plane interacted with the feet, which were
              | defined by a three dimensional mesh digitized from computed tomography of a cadaver
              | foot (Erdemir et al., 2009). An elastic foundation contact model between the contact
              | plane and the foot mesh generated reaction forces between the foot and floor. Stiffness

              | three-dimensional torsional bushing. The bushing acted like a set of three uncoupled,
              | nonlinear torsional springs between the distal tibia and the calcaneus, crossing the
              | talocrural and subtalar joints. We represented the nonlinear torque–deflection behavior

text          | about the x, y, and z axes as uncoupled functions defined by cubic polynomials (Figure
              | 4.2). We determined the polynomial coefficients by minimizing the root-mean-squared
              | error between the cubic polynomials and the passive torque–angle behavior measured in
              | cadavers (Chen et al., 1988). The bushing captured the passive response of all ligaments
              | and soft structures that cross the ankle, excluding musculature. The root-mean-squared
              | errors between the bushing moments and the measured moments were 0.2 N-m about the
              | x-axis, 0.6 N-m about the y-axis, and 0.2 N-m about the z-axis.

title         | 4.2.2. Generating nominal simulations of landing
text          |         We generated a nominal simulation of single-leg landing on level ground based
              | on experimental measurements (Shultz et al., 2015). We used the three-dimensional
              | kinematics and ground reaction force data of a single subject (19 year old female, 68 kg
              | mass, 1.8 m height) performing five landing trials onto her right leg. Each trial began
              | with the subject standing on a block 0.4 meters above the ground, followed by a
              | voluntary drop onto a flat, level surface after which she landed and balanced solely on her
              | right foot.
              |         We generated simulations of single-leg landing using the Forward Dynamics Tool
              | in OpenSim (Delp et al., 2007). Simulations began at the time of first foot-floor contact.
              | Initial conditions for the joint angles and velocities were determined from the average
              | values of the five experimental trials measured at the time of first foot–floor contact.
              | Excitations of the torso, hip, knee, ankle plantarflexor, and ankle dorsiflexor muscles
              | were modeled with muscle stretch feedback controllers. The stretch feedback controllers
              | excited the leg muscles prior to and during landing. Each muscle’s stretch feedback
              | controller computed the instantaneous muscle excitation, xm, according to Equation 4.1.

              |  aCA
              | la   . Only positive muscle stretch and velocity were considered, as indicated by the

              | stretch feedback controller parameters with an optimization that minimized the integral of
              | error between the simulated and experimentally measured kinematics. The stretch
              | feedback controller produced muscle activations that allowed the leg to flex under the
              | influence of gravity and muscles, and reproduced the experimentally measured landing

title         | 4.2.3. Inducing ankle inversion in simulated landings
text          |        Quantifying the protective effects of muscle coordination strategies required a
              | landing condition that induced inversion injuries. Having generated a nominal simulation
              | of a safe landing on level ground, we perturbed the landing conditions to induce rapid
              | ankle inversion upon impact. Firstly, the subtalar joint angle and velocity at landing were
              | set to 0 degrees and 0 degrees/second. Secondly, we inclined the floor to 30 degrees in

              | a moment about the subtalar joint that rapidly inverted the ankle. This simulation scenario
              | served as the basis for exploring coordination of the ankle evertor and invertor muscles.

title         | 4.2.4. Quantifying the effect of planned co-activation
text          |        We quantified the effect of planned co-activation by varying the level of muscular
              | co-activation of muscles that cross the subtalar joint during the 30-degree incline landing
              | scenario. Co-activation was modeled as constant, feedforward activation of the opposing
              | ankle evertor and invertor muscles groups, which generated zero net subtalar moment at
              | initial ground contact (subtalar angle equal to zero). For a given co-activation level, all
              | evertor muscles received the same activation. All invertor muscles received 93% of the
              | evertor activations due to their larger moment-generating capacity. We generated eleven
              | independent simulations varying the level of constant, planned co-activation from 0% (no
              | active contraction) to 100% (maximal evertor contraction and 93% invertor contraction)
              | in 10% increments. All other parameters and inputs were held constant. The simulation
              | began when the foot impacted the inclined ground and proceeded for 150 milliseconds.
              | To quantify the effects of co-activation level on ankle inversion, we observed whether the
              | subtalar joint angle exceeded a predetermined injury threshold of 30 degrees, which was
              | chosen based on a cadaver study (Aydogan et al., 2006) which found that repaired lateral
              | ligaments of the ankle failed at inversion angles of 35±6 degrees (Figure 4.4, gray area).

title         | 4.2.5. Quantifying the effect of ankle stretch reflexes
text          |        We quantified the effect of stretch reflexes by varying the intensities of ankle
              | evertor and invertor muscular responses to stretch during the 30 degree incline landing
              | scenario. Evertor and invertor muscle stretch reflexes were modeled as muscle velocity
              | controllers with a response delay. The constant response delay captured the latency due to
              | neural transmission delay between muscle stretch and muscle excitation, which has been
              | measured experimentally as 60–120 milliseconds in the human peroneal muscles
              | (Beckman and Buchanan, 1995; Karlsson and Andreasson, 1992; Konradsen and Bohsen
              | Ravn, 1991; Vaes et al., 2002). We chose a constant response delay of 60 milliseconds to

title         | 4.3. Results
text          |        Strong co-activation of the ankle evertors and invertors prior to landing prevented
              | ankle inversion angles from exceeding the injury threshold (Figure 4.4). Increasing co-
              | activation level from 0% (blue) to 100% (red) decreased peak inversion angle from 49
              | degrees to 17 degrees. Increasing co-activation also decreased peak inversion velocity
              | from 950 degrees/second to 550 degrees/second. Increasing simulated co-activation up to
              | 60% increased the time to exceeding the injury threshold (gray area) from 62 to 120
              | milliseconds. Co-activation levels of 62% and above prevented ankle inversion from
              | exceeding the injury threshold altogether.
              |        Stretch reflexes of the evertors in response to landing failed to prevent excessive
              | ankle inversion (Figure 4.5). For all values of the reflex gain, kv, ranging from 0 (blue) to
              | 10 (red), ankle inversion angles exceeded the injury threshold (grey area). Also for all
              | values of kv, ankle inversion angle exceeded the injury threshold quickly, within 62
              | milliseconds of impact. Prior to 60 milliseconds, the ankle inversion trajectories under all
              | conditions were identical, due to the 60 millisecond reflex delay, and exhibited a peak
              | inversion velocity of 950 degrees/second.

title         | 4.4. Discussion
text          |        Our simulations suggest that coordinated activity of the ankle muscles can prevent
              | excessive ankle inversion during an inversion-inducing landing scenario. Co-activating
              | the evertor and invertor muscles prevented ankle inversion angles from exceeding the
              | threshold for ankle inversion sprains. Conversely, stretch reflexes of the evertor and
              | invertor muscles failed to prevent excessive ankle inversion angles because the injury
              | occurs within 62 milliseconds in our simulated landing scenario, before reflexes generate
              | stabilizing forces. This result suggests that interventions aimed at retraining muscle
              | coordination should target feedforward co-activation to prevent lateral ankle sprains.
              |        Planned, feedforward co-activation of the ankle evertor and invertor muscles
              | rapidly and effectively protects the ankle from unanticipated inversion insults in our
              | simulated landing. With planned coordination of the evertors and invertors, the muscles
              | are active and generating force to stiffen the ankle in preparation for the large inversion
              | moment induced at landing. As the ankle inverts, the actively lengthening evertors and
              | shortening invertors generate a net eversion moment that immediately resists inversion.
              | This occurs because of the force–length–velocity property of muscle, which has a
              | stabilizing influence (John et al., 2013), and has been called a ‘preflex’ to refer to the pre-

              | the net active muscle moment is large enough, the passive moment due to the lateral
              | ankle ligaments is negligible. Experimental electromyography recordings show that
              | individuals co-activate the ankle muscles in midair during landing and jumping tasks
              | (Caulfield et al., 2004; Grüneberg et al., 2003), suggesting that it may be possible to
              | increase co-activation through training. Higher co-activation generated higher joint
              | stiffness and reduced the maximum inversion angles during our landing simulations.
              | Wright et al. (2000a) found that increased ankle stiffness due to passive structures, such
              | as ankle orthoses and tape, reduced the incidence of simulated inversion injuries. Our
              | simulations support the protective effect of ankle stiffening and demonstrate that the
              | evertor and invertor muscles can achieve this stiffness without assistance from orthoses
              | or tape.
              |            Stretch reflexes, regardless of their intensity, show little capacity to protect the
              | ankle from unanticipated inversion insults upon landing, especially when the injuries
              | occur within approximately 60 milliseconds, as they did in our simulations. Our
              | simulations demonstrate that the fastest stretch reflexes consistently recorded in healthy
              | human evertor muscles (Calatayud et al., 2014; Vaes et al., 2002) are too slow to prevent
              | the inversion injury posed in this study. This finding contradicts research that suggests
              | improving peroneal reflex latency may prevent inversion injuries (Akhbari et al., 2007;
              | Clark and Burden, 2005; Delahunt, 2007; Osborne et al., 2001; Sheth et al., 1997). Fong
              | et al., (2013, 2012) demonstrated that a device with fast injury detection and external
              | electrical stimulation could provide artificially fast peroneal contractions in under 10
              | milliseconds. However, our findings show that, lacking advanced feedback control
              | devices such as Fong’s, interventions to reduce evertor latency are unlikely to prevent
              | rapid (< 60 milliseconds) inversion injuries.
              |            Our simulation approach for exploring ankle inversion injuries is subject to
              | limitations. First, we defined an injury threshold of 30 degrees supination about the
              | subtalar joint based on an experiment on repaired lateral ligaments (Aydogan et al.,
              | 2006). We chose a conservative injury threshold of 30 degrees such that a simulated
              | injury represents the limit at which injury would likely occur in the highest-risk
              | individuals. The injury threshold could vary in non-injured ankles and between
meta          | 50
text          | individuals. Second, we lumped all 47 muscles of the landing leg and torso into only five
              | groups of stretch feedback controllers (torso, hip, knee, plantarflexor, and dorsiflexor
              | muscles). These groups did not separate hip flexors from hip extensors or knee flexors
              | from knee extensors. Supplementary to this study, we developed landing models using up
              | to nine functional groups coordinating the landing leg. Adding this complexity did not
              | affect our findings, thus we present the simplest model here. Additionally, by using the
              | same muscle controllers at the torso, hip, knee, and plantarflexion degrees of freedom in
              | all simulation conditions, we assumed that the landing model could not alter whole-body
              | coordination. This assumption corresponds to rapid injury scenarios, in which the
              | individual would not have sufficient time to change her landing posture or leg stiffness.
              | However, altering landing posture and leg stiffness may help mitigate ankle inversion
              | injuries and could be explored in future studies. Finally, while ankle inversion injuries
              | occur during landing, running, change of direction, and collision, we only simulated
              | injuries during landing on a surface inclined at 30 degrees. Other scenarios, which allow
              | more time to adjust, may allow for reflexes to make a significant contribution to
              | protecting the joint. It should be noted, however, that the mechanisms allowing co-
              | activated evertors to resist inversion moments more rapidly than evertor reflexes would
              | apply to any ankle inversion scenario, regardless of what causes the injurious inversion
              | moment.

text          |        This dissertation presents three studies conducted to advance the understanding of
              | human motor coordination and its effects on knee and ankle function. The first study
              | described a modeling and optimization framework we developed for varying muscle
              | activations and tibiofemoral forces during walking. Increased tibiofemoral forces during
              | walking have been linked to osteoarthritis and pain in the knee. Our analyses revealed
              | that activating the gluteus medius, psoas major, iliacus, and soleus muscles decreased the
              | tibiofemoral force, while activating the gastrocnemius and rectus femoris muscles
              | increased in tibiofemoral force. The second study employed a similar modeling and
              | optimization framework to estimate the tibiofemoral forces during walking in crouch gait
              | and quantify the variation in tibiofemoral forces due to varying severity of crouch. Our
              | results demonstrate that compressive tibiofemoral force increases quadratically with
              | crouch severity, which may explain why knee pain is common among individuals who
              | walk in crouch. The final study described a human landing simulator with novel muscle
              | stretch controllers for exploring muscle coordinations that may prevent lateral ankle
              | sprains. By varying the intensity to two strategies for coordinating the ankle evertors and
              | invertors at landing, we discovered that preparatory co-activation may prevent rapid
              | ankle inversion sprains while fast stretch reflexes likely would not. When regarded as a
              | body of work, these three studies make significant contributions in the form of impactful
              | scientific findings and freely available technology for the research community.

text          |        Activating the prime hip and ankle muscles, which are uniarticular and do not
              | cross the knee, decreases tibiofemoral force, while activating the gastrocnemius and
              | rectus femoris increases tibiofemoral force during walking. Our findings provide new
              | insight about how specific muscle activations might cause compensatory changes in other
              | muscles to decrease or increase tibiofemoral forces during walking. Prior to this
              | dissertation, the mathematical redundancy caused by having many more muscles than
              | joints was considered a technological challenge. Often named “the muscle redundancy

meta          | 52
text          | problem”, this was typically “solved” using optimizations to pick one possible
              | distribution of muscle forces by expressing an objective function, such as minimizing
              | muscle force, muscle effort, or metabolic cost. Researchers studying the knee joint would
              | then use these specific distributions of muscle forces as the “solutions” and analyze
              | which muscles directly loaded the tibiofemoral joint. Conversely, we chose to use muscle
              | redundancy as a feature, leveraging it to vary the distribution of muscle forces and
              | resulting tibiofemoral forces during the same walking motion. As a result, we discovered
              | that activating muscles at the hip and ankle caused compensatory changes in activations
              | of muscles crossing the knee and altered the compressive tibiofemoral force. We
              | identified that the gluteus medius, psoas major, iliacus, and soleus, (uniarticular hip and
              | ankle muscles) had the greatest capacity to decrease tibiofemoral force during walking,
              | making them prime targets for interventions against knee OA and pain.
              |        Compressive tibiofemoral forces increase quadratically with knee flexion during
              | the stance phase of walking in a crouch gait. Knee pain and even early onset
              | osteoarthritis are common among individuals who walk with a crouch gait. Our findings
              | show that walking in severe crouch gait generates tibiofemoral forces at least three-times
              | larger than those generated in unimpaired gait. This result suggests that the crouched
              | posture and elevated tibiofemoral forces could contribute to early cartilage degeneration
              | and knee pain, but also suggest that correcting crouch gait could help slow this
              | degradation or alleviate pain. However, since our results show that walking in mild
              | crouch could feasibly generate tibiofemoral forces as low as unimpaired walking,
              | interventions to correct crouch and achieve unimpaired kinematics may have diminishing
              | returns with regard to joint loading.
              |        Preparatory co-activation of the ankle evertors and invertor muscles during
              | landing can provide strong and rapid resistance to ankle sprains, while stretch reflexes
              | are too slow. Our findings reveal that a co-activated, stiff ankle can generate moments in
              | equilibrium when the ankle is neutral, then rapidly generate protective moments as soon
              | as any perturbation inverts the ankle toward a sprain. Unlike reflexes which incur a
              | neuromotor delay of up to 150 milliseconds, the co-activated ankle muscles are already
              | generating force and provide a purely mechanical “preflex” response that acts instantly.
              | Prior to this dissertation, neuromotor retraining interventions to prevent ankle sprains

              | However, even after those interventions, evertors reflexes still incur delays of 60
              | milliseconds or more. Our findings demonstrate that even the fastest reflexes with 60
              | millisecond delays are too slow to protect the ankle from sprains during common
              | scenarios. Therefore, our findings highlight that studies proposing ankle sprain
              | interventions should focus on methods for training co-activation “preflexes” at landing
              | instead of improving evertors reaction times.

text          |        Open source optimization software for simultaneously minimizing joint loads and
              | muscle activations during a motion. In Chapter 2, we used an optimization with a
              | customizable objective function (Equation 2.1) to specify different muscle coordination
              | strategies and vary muscle activations. This optimization, which allowed us to penalize
              | combinations of muscle activity and joint forces in the model, is versatile and applicable
              | to many regimes of biomechanical research. Therefore, we ensured that this optimization

              | patellofemoral loads during full-body, muscle-driven motion. Accurate estimates of
              | tibiofemoral forces require a knee mechanism that captures the tibiofemoral,
              | patellofemoral, and quadriceps mechanisms and the loads transferred between them. Prior
              | to this dissertation, full body models in OpenSim were designed for and excelled at
              | modeling quadriceps moment arms and tensions, but could not resolve the tibiofemoral
              | and patellofemoral contact loads. We developed (Chapter 2 and 3) a knee mechanism
              | within a full-body model which could resolve the resultant knee contact forces using a
              | coupled tibiofemoral and patellofemoral mechanism actuated by the quadriceps muscles.

              | femoral condyles and the tibial plateau. OA typically develops more frequently and more
              | severely in the medial compartment of the knee (Felson et al., 2008). When studying
              | medial compartment OA, researchers often use the externally applied knee adduction
              | moment as a surrogate measure of the medial knee contact force (Baliunas, 2002; Shull et
              | al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2007) because it is easy to estimate from human motion capture
              | measurements. However, the external knee adduction moment can not capture the effects
              | of muscles tensions crossing the knee and how they change the distribution of medial and
              | lateral tibiofemoral contact forces. We, in collaboration with Lerner and colleagues, have
              | augmented the knee mechanism described in this dissertation to include coupled medial

              | dissertation and explore the effects of varied muscle coordination on the medial and

              | tibiofemoral forces due to changes in muscle activity (similar to Chapter 2) and changes

              | However, the modeling and optimization tools presented in Chapters 2 and 3 could easily

              | ankle injuries, we assumed that the coordination of the remaining leg muscles and the
              | landing pose did not change. Analyses of ankle injury mechanics typically focus on the
              | ankle itself and prohibit changes in full-body coordination. For example, Wright et al.
              | analyzed ankle injuries during side-stepping maneuvers, but specifically varied only the
              | passive ankle stiffness (Wright et al., 2000b) and the ankle pose (Wright et al., 2000a) at
              | landing while specifying identical limb pose, trunk pose, and muscle activations in a feed
              | forward manner. Studies testing coaching interventions to reduce the incidence of ankle
              | sprains in sports indicate that altering landing leg pose and torso pose at landing might
              | affect the likelihood of injury (Bahr et al., 1997). However, the effects of landing pose,
              | leg stiffness, or other full-body coordination elements have not been explored in a
              | systematic or mechanistic way. The open-source landing model and muscle stretch

text          |        Simultaneous optimization of kinematic strategy, muscle coordination strategy,
              | and joint loads to predict novel walking patterns. Research into the effects of muscle
              | coordination and kinematics on internal joint forces has largely fallen into two motifs:
              | first to alter muscle coordination without controlling for walking kinematics (Brandon et
              | al., 2014; DeMers et al., 2014), and second to alter walking kinematics without
              | controlling for muscle coordination (Fregly et al., 2009; Mündermann et al., 2008a; Shull
              | et al., 2011). Our work on varying muscle coordination during walking indicates that
              | changes in muscle activity can substantially decrease tibiofemoral forces during the
              | second half the stance phase. Conversely, studies to retrain and modify walking
              | kinematics show significant decreases in tibiofemoral forces during the first half of stance
              | phase. Combined, these findings indicate that coupling muscle activity and kinematics
              | corrections could dramatically decrease tibiofemoral forces throughout the entire walking
              | gait cycle. A grand research opportunity exists to systematically explore and co-optimize

              | expenditure, falling, or stubbing the toe, in optimizations that learn and tune appropriate
              | parameters for the biologically-inspired controllers. This process has resulted in
              | autonomous locomotion controllers that predict realistic human walking and running
              | motions by simply specifying slow or fast over-ground speeds and without relying on
              | motion capture data (Wang et al., 2012). Furthermore, these autonomous locomotion

              | which predicted humanlike compensations in their walking strategies (Dorn et al., 2015).

              | predict novel changes in muscle activity and kinematics that decrease joint contact forces
              | during walking. Instead of posing movement heuristics that minimize metabolic

              | subjects (Shull et al., 2013, 2011). Conceivably, similar real-time feedback on muscle
              | coordination to increase gluteus medius and soleus activity while decreasing
              | gastrocnemius and rectus femoris activity may be possible, but remains largely
              | unexplored. Similarly, the capacity of individuals to modulate the level of invertor and
              | evertor co-activity during landing is unknown. Systems for real-time detection and
              | feedback of muscle electromyography (EMG) do exist for the upper extremity, and have
              | been used used with visual (Young et al., 2011) and tactile (Bloom et al., 2010; Casellato
              | et al., 2013) feedback to modify muscle activity during reaching tasks. EMG
              | measurements of the gluteus medius, soleus, gastrocnemius, and rectus femoris are
              | commonly collected during experiments of walking and other motions of the lower body.
              | In ankle injury research, EMG of the superficial ankle invertors and evertors are
              | commonly measured as well. Therefore, a real-time feedback system for measuring EMG
              | and suggesting changes in lower limb muscle activity is feasible, but the capacity of
              | subjects heed the suggestion and change muscle activity during walking or landing
              | remains unknown. This leaves a rich opportunity for human subject research aimed at

title         | Appendix B: Calculating joint contact forces in OpenSim
text          |          In order to calculate tibiofemoral contact forces during walking (Chapters 2 and
              | 3), we developed a general method to calculate joint loads transferred between any two
              | contacting bodies in OpenSim. This method, called the Joint Reaction Analysis,
              | computes the resultant forces and moments that represent the internal loads carried by the
              | joint structure. For example, Chapters 2 and 3 report joint forces representing the sum of
              | contact forces between the tibial and femoral cartilage and all ligament forces crossing
              | the tibiofemoral joint

              | not require calculating internal forces, such as the joint contact forces. Therefore, the
              | Joint Reaction Analysis in OpenSim incorporates a post-processing procedure that uses
              | the muscle forces and joint kinematics to calculate resultant joint loads.
              |        Figure B.1.A shows an example model consisting of segments linked in a
              | kinematic chain. Joints between these segments do not need to have classical engineering
              | definitions, such as a revolute joint or spherical joint, but instead can have more
              | physiologic descriptions. For example, the motion between body segments q& and q&r1
              | may be described by splines that couple the rotations and translations of the knee. For
              | each time point in an analysis, a recursive operation begins with the most distal bodies
              | and progresses proximally to calculate the joint loads. The force at each joint is
              | calculated by performing a force balance on the body distal to the joint.
              |        A single step in this recursive procedure is analogous to constructing a free body
              | diagram for each rigid body and resolving the point load that must be applied to the joint
              | to balance the forces and motions of the body. To calculate ]& , the resultant forces and
              | moments at joint i, the body distal to joint i, q& , is treated as an independent body with
              | known kinematics in a global reference frame. In the example system (Figure B.1.B), '&
              | represents the six dimensional vector of known angular and linear accelerations of q& .
              | Since these accelerations are reconstructed from Simbody’s generalized equations of
              | motion, they capture any kinematic complexity in the joint description. 3/A>/B)C. and

              | moment and force at the body origin, t= and 3= , that are required to balance the equation.
