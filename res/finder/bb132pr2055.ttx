text          | My dissertation investigates the ways in which political dynamics influence decision-
              | making at central banks, particularly following financial crises. I focus on the panic
              | of 1907, the Great Depression, and the recent global financial crisis. I address this
              | question by looking at the different mechanisms through which political influence oc-
              | curs. I devote a chapter to examining this topic in each of the following contexts:
              | the (pre-WWII) evolution of the structure of the Federal Reserve, the preferences
              | of monetary policymakers around elections (post-1988), and the Federal Reserve’s
              | lending during the 2008 financial crisis. Through this series of chapters, I find that
              | politicians designed the American central bank in such a way that political consid-
              | erations are able to consistently affect monetary policymakers. However, stemming
              | from the partial compromises inherent in its design, this influence is constrained in
              | such a way to ensure its stability, as too much would lead to a new equilibrium in
              | which the central bank is more apolitical.

text          | After being sworn-in as the Chairman of the Board of Governors for the Federal
              | Reserve System (“Fed”) for the second time, Ben Bernanke reaffirmed the institution’s
              | political independence:

text          |         The Federal Reserve has been granted, both in law and in political tradi-
              |         tion, considerable independence and autonomy. That independence serves
              |         important public objectives. Critically, it allows the Federal Open Market
              |         Committee to make monetary policy in the longer-term economic interests
              |         of the American people, rather than in the service of short-term political
              |         imperatives. It also allows the Federal Reserve to make supervisory de-
              |         cisions based on the facts of each case and the need to preserve financial
              |         stability, not on the basis of political considerations.1
blank         | 
text          |       The reason Bernanke took such a public stand defending the Fed’s independence
              | is simple: central bank independence is widely seen as a necessary condition for the
              | attainment of economic and financial stability. Thus, Bernanke and central bankers

              | cratic policymakers uninterested in domestic politics and unable to be influenced by
              | external pressures. Without that reputation, they know that macroeconomic out-
              | comes would be much more susceptible to harmful fluctuations. Given the ample
              | evidence documenting this connection between central bank independence and fa-
              | vorable economic policy outcomes, such as low rates of inflation, this is far from a
              | unsubstantiated belief.2
              |        However, just because a policymaker wants to cultivate the perception that they
              | are of a certain type does not mean that they actually are of this type. In other
              | words, how do we know that Chairman Bernanke was actually telling the truth in
              | the above quote and not just engaging in “cheap talk”? Although the degree to
              | Bernanke’s claims are true is a fundamentally empirically question, the extant litera-
              | ture does not provide a compelling answer to it. The existing studies with the most
              | thorough investigations of central bank independence place an exclusive focus on the
              | institution’s governing statutes and the insights made are only valid when making
              | cross-national comparisons of central bank independence (e.g., Cukierman, Miller,
              | and Neyapti 2002, Polillo and Guillen 2005, and Crowe and Meade 2008). Moreover,
              | these typically consider only the rules pertaining to the conduct of monetary policy,
              | thereby ignoring the crucial role that central banks play as lenders of last resort.
              |        Other studies have taken a more targeted approach in studying the impact of
              | politics on policymaking at the Fed by asking whether or not monetary policy becomes

              | as to whether a so-called political business cycle exists in contemporary American
              | monetary policy. The answers range from outright skepticism (Alesina, Roubini, and
              | Cohen 1997 and Abrams and Iossifov 2006) to those claiming it readily exists, but
              | only under Republican administrations (Clark and Arel-Bundock 2013) or always
              | does, but only in one direction (Hellerstein 2007).
              |        A related question, though, has yet to even be answered. Despite the prominent
              | role in plays as a lender of last resort, no scholarship yet exists on the degree to which
              | firms’ political activities and connections affect its borrowing from the central bank
              | during periods of liquidity constraints. This inattention combined with the lack of
              | a consensus over the question of if the Fed alters monetary policy around elections
              | makes it clear that we really do not know whether Chairman Bernanke was telling
              | the truth when he claimed that the Fed was a politically impartial institution. My
              | dissertation seeks to remedy this with a thorough examination of how politics affect
              | central bankers at the Federal Reserve. Its main objective is to reveal the mechanisms
              | through which political pressure and bias can influence central bankers.
              |        I start in Chapter 2 by describing why the firewall between the Fed and elected
              | officials is intentionally thin. While not often a focus for scholars of monetary pol-
              | icy, a central bank’s structure – whether decentralized, centralized and controlled
              | by bankers, or centralized and politically controlled – has important implications for
              | policy outcomes. This is because interest groups, motivated by the distributive conse-
              | quences of monetary policy, have divergent interests over not only these outcomes, but
meta          |    3
text          |     Put simply, the rationale for this monetary policy adjustment can provide a potent, if short-lived,
              | stimulus to the economy may help improve voter perceptions of the incumbent party.

text          | also the underlying institutional structure. To provide a full account of the Fed’s pe-
              | culiar structure, though, I go on to describe how the institutional design of Congress,
              | with its multiple veto points, affects how these interests factor into the policymaking
              | process. Finally, I show how economic shocks can shift these preferences and produce
              | changes in the Fed’s design.
              |    In applying this theory to the politics of central banking from the dawn of the
              | 20th century to today, I use qualitative evidence, spatial models, and econometric
              | tests to provide substantiating evidence. With this multifaceted approach (a first of
              | its kind in the literature), I describe how the panic of 1907 led to the creation of the
              | Federal Reserve in 1913 as a decentralized institution. I argue this was the result
              | of a repeated bargaining game in Congress and, more specifically, its Democratic
              | caucus, then dominated by libertarian-like adherents to the real bills doctrine. I
              | then explain how World War I and the Great Depression shifted preferences among
              | pivotal voters, thereby catalyzing a substantial reform of the Fed’s structure in 1935
              | and producing a central bank only marginally protected from political influence. This
              | change has had a profound impact on the institution by empowering those in favor
              | of more accommodative monetary policy. Without these structural changes, it would
              | have been much less likely that those in this group would have been able to make
              | monetary policy outcomes in the United States in line with a populist agenda to the
              | degree that they did. In the same way, this structural change paved the way for
              | monetary policy becoming susceptible to electoral cycles, a topic explored in detail
              | in Chapter 3.

text          |    In that chapter, I use an originally constructed (and hand-collected) data set
              | derived from meeting transcripts to show how members of the Fed’s primary pol-
              | icymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), are influenced by
              | electoral objectives. Specifically, officials with membership in the party of the pres-
              | ident are more likely to recommend interest rate cuts around elections than they
              | otherwise are. This is true for both members of the politically-appointed Board of
              | Governors as well as the non-appointed presidents of the twelve reserve banks, but
              | only when the chairman and the median member of the committee also share that
              | common party identification. This tendency of copartisans at the Fed to recommend
              | accommodative monetary policy (i.e. promote growth in the money supply) is also
              | present in meetings held during political scandals, as coded by Nyhan (2014). By
              | discovering the precise way in which elections impact contemporary monetary pol-

              | decisions in even our most apolitical institutions.
              |    Chapter 4 moves on to ask a novel question: how did political pressure affect
              | the Fed’s lending during the financial crisis of 2007–2009, when the Fed played its
              | biggest role in stabilizing the economy since the Great Depression. Using a new data
              | set containing contract-level information on such lending, I find that more politically
              | active and better-connected financial institutions did not receive more capital, once
              | financial covariates have been accounted for. However, those more active in lobbying
              | Congress and the Fed over issues pertaining to this lending program appear to have
              | directly benefited from such actions, as multivariate tobit regressions report that
              | such firms derived more profits by borrowing from the Fed than their less politically
              | active counterparts. This finding provides additional evidence that the Fed’s ability

text          | In this chapter, I ask: what explains the structure of the Federal Reserve? Though
              | several authors offer explanations for some of the individual pieces within this broader
              | puzzle, as far as I am aware, this is the first attempt to offer a comprehensive ex-
              | planation of the structure of the American central bank. This relative scarcity of
              | attention comes despite the importance of this question, as the design of the Fed has
              | enormous implications for policy outcomes. This would not be true if central banking
              | was a completely objective science. It is not, though. As Kenneth Rogoff (2014) put
              | it, “no matter how much central banks may wish to present the level of inflation as
              | a mere technocratic decision, it is ultimately a social choice.”
              |    Thus, just as in other elements of economic policy, different interest groups have
              | contrasting preferences. On one end, labor groups and debtors favor an expansive
              | monetary supply, while financiers and lenders prefer the opposite, desiring stable

              | policy: delegating to an agency is simply far more efficient. As a result, the most di-
              | rect mechanism through which interest groups can produce monetary policy outcomes
              | in line with their interests is to put their allies in change of the agency. However, those
              | in power at the time of the agency’s creation know that they will not retain their au-
              | thority in perpetuity. Thus, to maximize their long-term impact on policy outcomes,
              | they focus less on the first wave of (non-permanent) appointments to the agency and
              | more on its structure. This is a rational decision since the initial structural setup
              | limits potential changes in the distribution of power at the agency decision-making
              | is delated to. In other words, it can “lock in” the degree of control of the enacting
              | coalition for the long-term.
              |    As a result, the three different groups (introduced above) each have their own
              | induced preferences over the central bank’s structure. Bankers, creditors, and other
              | financiers tend to want the central bank to be highly centralized since that facilitates
              | efficient decision-making and a greater ability to use monetary policy to limit fluc-
              | tuations in the inflation rate. However, they want these decisions to be free from
              | political influence since that is associated with increases in the money supply, an un-
              | desirable outcome for a group prioritizing price and financial stability. Labor groups
              | and debtors have the opposite inclination, since a more robust supply of money is
              | associated with lower unemployment and easier loan repayment. So while they also
              | want a highly centralized central bank, they want its officials to be as responsive to
              | the public as possible. In other words, they desire a politicized central bank. Finally,

text          | what we now call libertarians have an entirely different set of goals, not wanting
              | monetary policy to be used a tool to alter price levels and economic output. They
              | therefore favor a weak central bank with only very limited powers, to the degree they
              | want one at all.
              |       The distribution in the degree to which these groups are represented in the federal
              | government during the legislative debate plays a key role in determining how the Fed
              | is structured. Prior to the panic of 1907, few saw monetary policy as a discretionary
              | art and thus a majority preferred that the US have no central bank. However, this
              | economically painful event changed many minds regarding how to best conduct mon-
              | etary policy and a consensus emerged that re-establishing a central bank would be
              | beneficial.1 The question then became how centralized and politicized it should be.
              | Once Democrats gained unified control of government in 1912, this decision came
              | down to the division of power within the party. One group, inspired by William Jen-
              | nings Bryan, favored creating a strong, yet politicized institution, while another, led
              | by Carter Glass, maintained similar preferences from before the crisis and preferred
              | creating a weak, decentralized institution. This latter group proved more powerful so
              | the ultimate outcome, passed as the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, created a central
              | bank in little more than name. That is, the Fed as initially constructed was highly
              | decentralized and possessed limited policy authority.
              |       This distribution of preferences did not persist, though. To help meet the soaring
              | financing demands of the US government and reduce the impact of declining growth
              | in the supply of gold, both a direct result of World War I (i.e., an exogenous shock),
              | the Fed began buying and selling Treasury securities. These so-called open market

text          | operations, which had not been used until then, demonstrated how monetary policy
              | could serve as a powerful economic policy lever. When the Fed failed to maximize this
              | tool’s potential following the start of the Great Depression (when monetary policy-
              | makers maintained a “hands off” approach), many became convinced that structural
              | change was needed.
              |    This was particularly true among Democrats, who gained unified control of gov-
              | ernment in 1932 thanks to the economic downturn also producing a severe anti-
              | incumbency (i.e., Republican) bias. As a result of this frustration with the Fed’s
              | lack of open market operations, many in the party had swung towards favoring a
              | strong central bank with a high degree of political control. They figured that such a
              | change would make the Fed less likely to repeat its mistakes in a future downturn.
              | The only way reform could be stopped would be if the wing of the party maintaining
              | a preference for a decentralized Fed, still led by Glass, retained a veto over change.
              | However, following a further leftward shift in the composition of the Senate in the
              | 1934 midterm elections, Glass came to be outnumbered in his own subcommittee and
              | therefore lost his ability to prevent unwanted legislation. With that, the path towards
              | change was cleared. When President Roosevelt signed the Banking Act of 1935 into
              | law, the Fed became a centralized and fairly politicized institution.
              |    This result induced a structural equilibrium that persists today. This lack of sub-
              | sequent change can be directly attributed to no shifts in the distribution of preferences
              | having occurred since then that were big enough to induce structural revisions of the
              | Fed. So while we have, of course, seen big changes in the composition of government
              | since the New Deal, there have been few instances in which a majority of both houses
              | of Congress may have favored a change in the structure of the Fed. In each of these,

              | control level, or by the White House.2 That is not to say reform is never going to
              | happen: the financial crisis of 2008 made monetary policy a prominent political issue
              | once more and, if the industrial organization of Congress changes enough, further
              | structural change could result.
              |        This chapter proceeds as follows. In section 2.1, I introduce the theoretical un-
              | derpinnings behind the politics of monetary policy and central bank structure more
              | specifically. In section 2.2, I apply this theory to explain why the Federal Reserve
              | Act of 1913 ended up looking the way it did. Section 2.3 moves on to discuss how
              | WWI combined with the Great Depression to stimulate changes in preferences over
              | this issue. Section 2.4 then details how these changes caused the structural reforms
              | made via the Banking Act of 1935. I conclude in Section 2.5 with a summary of my
              | findings and discussion of the subsequent and potential future reform attempts.

blank         | 
text          | Although a casual observer may not view monetary policy as a controversial topic,
              | it can be highly divisive. This is because there exists a persistent and inverse re-
              | lationship between inflation and employment. As Irving Fisher discovered in 1926,
              | prices tend to rise faster when unemployment is low and slower when it is high. Put
              | differently, when inflation is high, unemployment is low and vice versa (see Figure 3.2
              | below). Given this reality, there is little agreement over how monetary policymakers
              | should balance these two competing objectives.
meta          |    2
text          |     Since preferences are often common knowledge, explicit vetoes do not always have to be formally
              | exercised. This is particularly true in the case of the president.

text          |        On one end of the spectrum, the utility of labor groups is maximized under con-
              | ditions of full employment so they prefer active growth in the supply of money since
              | that helps produce their desired outcome. Debtors – such as homeowners, farmers,
              | and students – exhibit similar preferences since a higher rate of inflation reduces their
              | borrowing cost.3 Conversely, lenders and owners of capital prioritize price stability
              | since low inflation is a necessary condition for their profitability. Hibbs (1977) sums
              | up this division: “low and middle income and occupational status groups are more
              | averse to unemployment than inflation, whereas, upper income and occupational sta-
              | tus groups are more concerned about inflation than unemployment” (p. 1470).4
              |        It is not surprising then that elected officials also exhibit divergent views over
              | how to handle the distributional trade-offs inherent in monetary policy. Countries
              | with right-wing governments tend to exhibit lower inflation than otherwise similar
              | countries ruled by leftist politicians (Hibbs 1978). This is also true in the case of the
              | US, where Democrats tend to have a higher inflation tolerance than their Republican
              | counterparts (Samuelson and Hopkins 1977, p. 30–31).

text          |       The question then becomes how to delegate this policy issue to the bureaucracy.
              | Politicians’ goal here is to “stack the deck” to ensure that the agency to which policy is
              | delegated (the Fed) brings about outcomes consistent with their interests and those of
              | their constituents (McCubbins et al. 1987, p. 255). Legislators generally try to do so
              | in two ways: impose formal rules and strict guidelines over administrative procedures
              | to minimize bureaucratic discretion and / or sculpt the structure of the institution
              | to empower those with similar interests. In the case of monetary policy, relying
              | on the former can be both inefficient and ineffective so Congress has traditionally
              | focused on the latter mechanism.5 The uncertainty inherent in monetary policy adds
              | to the appeal of the latter since “political officials may not know what specific policy

              | to influence [the] decision” (McCubbins et al. 1987, p. 255). The bottom line: these
              | structural choices over the design of the central bank – as is true elsewhere in the
              | bureaucracy – “have important consequences for the content and direction of policy,
              | and political actors know it” (Moe 1989, p. 268).
              |     In the case of the Fed, the debate over its structure can be distilled into two
              | fundamental questions: how centralized should control be and should that control
              | be in the hands of public or private actors (i.e., those politically appointed or not)?
              | Importantly, however, this latter question of who possesses control of the institution
              | only matters insofar as control exists at all. As Lauchlin Currie, an economist working
              | on the Fed reforms in 1935, described “assuming, therefore, that it is desirable to have
              | discretionary control, and that control must be centralized and exercised by a body
              | which has both authority and responsibility, the issue becomes public versus private
              | control” (2005, p. 271). This intuition is displayed in Figure 2.2 below: the area
              | under the curve (shaded in light green) represents what is feasible. With low levels
              | of centralization, a high degree of political influence is impossible. Under high levels
              | of centralization, though, control can be highly politicized or not at all.6
              |     Most individuals, with moderate simplification, can be classified into favoring
              | a central bank structure resembling one of four possibilities, represented by points

meta          |     6
text          |       In this chapter, I use the term “politicization” to connote high levels of public control. Put
              | differently, as politicization (as I measure it) increases, policy outcomes become increasingly likely
              | to reflect the interests of the median voter. Conversely, as it decreases, control shifts away from
              | public officials and towards private bankers. Such a move would decrease the level of expected
              | inflation.

text          | A, B, C, and N on Figure 2.2. Debtors along with populists and those favoring
              | higher employment tend to favor A. This is because high levels of political control are
              | typically associated with a policy outcome they favor: higher inflation. Though this
              | relationship has only been well documented empirically in the last thirty years (Bade
              | and Parkin 1982; Alesina 1988, 1989; Grilli, Masciandaro, and Tabelline 1991), it has
              | long been well known that, if able to, politicians will manipulate the money supply to
              | serve their short-term interests, which usually leads to inflation. Exemplifying this,
              | James Madison explained in his Federalist No. 44 that the Constitution’s Article I
              | Section 10, prohibiting bills of credit and of laws impairing the obligation of contracts,
              | was explicitly included to limit such practices.
              |    On the other hand, bankers and those favoring low levels of inflation typically
              | prefer a highly centralized central bank they and their colleagues could control (option
              | C in Figure 2.2). As Wall Street financier Paul Warburg put it, “central banking,
              | like any other banking, is based on ‘sound credit,’ that the judging of credits is a
              | matter of business which should be left in the hands of business men” (p. 175). It

text          | is not surprising that he held this sentiment since empowering those with a similar
              | background increases the probability that the decisions they make will be consistent
              | with his own interests, chiefly a stable supply of money. In addition, centralizing the
              | decision-making authority facilitates strong responses to financial instability, a role
              | such individuals place high value on.
              |    Others prefer a third way (option B) in which centralization and politicization are
              | both limited. Its supporters like this form of central bank structure since they see it as
              | the best way to promote local economic constituencies and limit concentrated financial
              | and political power (McCulley 1992, p. 272). The goal here is to make the monetary
              | system elastic and therefore able to respond to the needs of the country’s small bankers
              | and businesses (McCulley 1992, p. 274). Limiting power is also important, since such
              | a decentralized structure facilitates self-regulation, which many in this group favor as
              | a result of their adherence to the real bills doctrine. This theory regards government
              | “interference” with the supply of money as unnecessary since the amount of credit
              | automatically responds to the business cycle (Wicker 2005, p. 16, 95–96).
              |    Of course, there have been and surely always will be those reluctant to embrace
              | any central bank. The reasons for supporting this option (N in Figure 2.2 above) are
              | more diverse. Some simply reject the appeal of the need for a central bank, instead
              | preferring an inelastic currency free from manipulation. Another rationale for this
              | position is the concern that any central bank, no matter how its design, will eventually
              | be captured by bankers and then used to promote those interests at the expense of
              | all others.

              | significant power vis-à-vis the other groups and was thus able to easily prevent the
              | few attempts at change. However, the panic of 1907 ended this equilibrium. Though
              | the panic started with a loss of confidence in only a single enterprise, the United
              | Copper Company, it quickly spread throughout the financial system as runs began on
              | financial institutions that had lent to investors trading United’s shares. A week later,
              | the Knickerbocker Trust Company, the third-largest trust in New York at the time,
              | collapsed and many of its peer institutions followed suit within the month (Bruner
              | and Carr 2008, p. 101). As a result of the panic of 1907, “the value of all listed stocks
              | in the United States declined 37%, making it among the most damaging financial
              | crashes of the 19th and 20th centuries, and affecting virtually every industrial sector”
              | (Bruner and Carr 2007, p. 115).
              |    Despite the breadth and depth of its economic destruction, this event was seen
              | as preventable. As Page and Page (1912) wrote, “crises occurred all over the world
              | in 1907, but the distinction of a wasteful panic and its hideous consequences were
              | reserved solely for the United States,” which was in the “conspicuous position” of
              | lacking a central bank (p. 28). As Bordo (1985) puts it, when compared to Great
              | Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and Canada, the US at the time was uniquely
              | “susceptible to banking panics” (p. 6). Had there been a central bank serving as a
              | lender of last resort, as there was, for example, in London with the Bank of England,
              | the bank runs that had toppled so many of New York-based trusts, would have been

text          | relatively easily addressed. That is, financial institutions could have met depositors’
              | demands for cash by tapping a credit line available at this “banker’s bank,” thereby
              | restoring confidence in its financial status. Without one, though, private banks had a
              | much more difficult time meeting these temporary liquidity constraints and, the many
              | that could not meet the entirety of the demands on them were forced to shutdown.
              | Realizing this and seeking to reduce the impact of future liquidity crises, policymak-
              | ers abandoned the dominant paradigm of economic beliefs to that point, which had
              | suggested that an inelastic currency was best for their constituents (West 1977, p.
              | 53; Link 1954, p. 44). Put simply, the panic of 1907 represents the first cause of
              | the Fed’s creation since without it, “it would have been impossible to overcome the
              | inertia in Congress” surrounding financial reform (Willis 1923, p. 43).
              |    While the literature is largely in agreement that the panic of 1907 was a necessary
              | condition for reform to the nation’s financial infrastructure, creating a central bank
              | was not the only option available to policymakers interested in improving financial
              | stability. An alternative approach would have been to instead focus on the underlying
              | structure of the American banking system. In fact, moving away from the prevailing
              | system of unit-banking may have been the most effective way to reduce the prevalence
              | of banking panics in the first place (Bordo 1985, Calomiris and Haber 2014). The idea
              | here is that allowing branch banking would greatly facilitate diversification among in
              | banks’ balance sheets, thereby reducing firm-specific risk and, ultimately, stabilizing
              | the overall system. The economic merits of branch banking were not necessarily
              | controversial – after all, such a system had effectively prevented banking crises in
              | Canada – but, politically, eliminating unit-banking was “infeasible” (Calomiris and
              | Haber 2014, p. 184). Thus, Republican policymakers in power at the time had little

text          | choice but to focus on the “next best” way to promote financial stability: dealing
              | with the centrality of currency supplies and therefore turned their focus to the debate
              | over the creation of a central bank (ibid, p. 185).
              |       Finally, there is the question of what was different about the panic of 1907 in
              | comparison to its predecessors. After all, the US had numerous banking panics be-
              | tween 1836, when the country’s previous central bank, the Second Bank of the United
              | States, had its charter expire, and 1907, but no monetary reform efforts succeeded
              | following those other crises. The are two main distinctions between the panic of 1907
              | and those other crises. First, the “policy technology” of central banking was less
              | developed prior to 1907. By this point, however, other developed countries’ central
              | banks had refined their ability to serve as a lender of last resort in a way that be-
              | gan to differentiate their responses to panics. In particular, the Bank of England
              | had succeeded in limiting the effects of a downturn in British financial markets in
              | 1907 (Bordo 1985, p. 19). Second, though the depth of the panic of 1907 was not
              | unprecedented, its breadth was. By originating in the systemically important New
              | York-based trusts, this liquidity crisis spread throughout the economy, and more than
              | any other time, affected a variety of industries and non-financial businesses. This de-
              | gree of contagion has obvious political implications, as policymakers representing a
              | variety of constituencies changed their views on the need for financial reform (Moen
              | and Tallman 1999). Highlighting this, in his speech accepting the Republican nomina-
              | tion for president, William Howard Taft remarked, “This inadequacy of our present
              | currency system, due to changed conditions and enormous expansion, is generally
              | recognized.”7
              |       In this reform-friendly environment, a second, more controversial question took

              | 
text          | hold: how should a lender of last resort be structured? This was not an easy question
              | for policymakers to agree on because serving as a successful lender of last resort also
              | requires that the institution possess monopoly power over the supply of money. That
              | is, for a central bank to be a true “banker’s bank,” it must be able to freely move
              | surplus money to where it is needed and doing so without a uniform currency would
              | be highly inefficient. Moreover, in certain circumstances, the amount of money needed
              | to stabilize the financial system may not be offset by existing surpluses. Thus, the
              | lender of last resort should also possess the ability to manipulate the supply of money
              | since, with that authority, it can more easily address systemic liquidity constraints.
              |    Of course, however, this authority could be abused. For example, in the French
              | Revolution, the National Assembly, a group of elected officials representing the bour-
              | geoisie, tried to solve the country’s financial strains by issuing an abundance of assig-
              | nats, its currency. This famously backfired, leading to hyperinflation that helped
              | contribute to the fall of the government. The question for policymakers was how
              | to balance these two concerns: an overly inelastic currency would continue to en-
              | able liquidity and banking crises, while an exceedingly elastic currency could provoke
              | hyperinflation, which could be just as or even more economically harmful. As in-
              | troduced above, different groups – and the policymakers representing them – had
              | divergent preferences over the desired degree of currency elasticity. In addition, given
              | the aforementioned need to delegate this monetary authority to an external agency,
              | a debate emerged in Congress over how to structure this to-be-formed central bank.
              |    On this question, the literature is split over which groups achieved their desired
              | outcomes. Some suggest it was merely the manifestation of private bankers’ interests
              | (e.g., Kolko 1963). Correspondingly, Wicker (2005) suggests much of the credit for

text          | the creation of the Fed should be given to Nelson Aldrich (R–RI), who served as an
              | advocate for Wall Street on Capitol Hill and provided the initial suggestion for the
              | re-establishment of an American central bank. Broz (1991) takes a similar if more
              | nuanced approach in arguing the Fed came to be thanks to New York bankers, who
              | wanted to increase their role (and the dollar’s) in international finance.
              |    However, these perspectives are in the minority; most instead suggest that the Fed
              | was the result of legislative compromise amongst interested parties (Cushman 1941,
              | Wiebe 1962, Clifford 1965, West 1974, Woolley 1984, White 1985, Kettl 1986, Greider
              | 1987, Calomiris and Haber 2014). Jeong, Miller, and Sobel (2008) speak for much of
              | the literature in arguing that the legislation was the “product of political compromise
              | among disparate groups represented in the US Congress” (p. 473) and therefore
              | represented “no party’s first choice” (p. 491). They acknowledge that this conclusion
              | comes despite the Democrats’ possession of unified control of government. As they
              | put it, “the final outcome was not the ideal point of the median of the majority party,
              | [but] rather was in the ‘empty’ space close to the center of the Senate” (ibid).
              |    While I agree with this suggestion that that the bill represented a compromise,
              | I disagree with the notion that it was approximately an even split between the two
              | parties. Instead, I argue, using the theory grounded in the spatial model introduced
              | above, the bill was a compromise amongst Democrats alone, a novel argument. The
              | reason for our different interpretations is straightforward: their reliance on roll call
              | votes leads to an assumption that all congressional Democrats preferred a decentral-
              | ized institution yet were opposed to making it independent. While I do not argue
              | against this specific conjecture (see Table 2.11 in the Appendix), it ignores the truism
              | introduced above that a central bank cannot be simultaneously highly politicized and

              | 
text          | decentralized. This explains the existence of an important split within the Democratic
              | party, with some in the party prioritizing decentralization and others politicization.
              | Thus, the outcome we observe – the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 – is not the result
              | of a centrist olive branch to Republicans, as they suggest. Rather, it is the result
              | of intraparty bargaining between the two groups of Democrats forced to bifurcate
              | by the constraints inherent in designing a central bank’s structure. Moreover, that
              | some Republicans voted for it is not an indication that Democrats sought out their
              | support; those that did were simply expressing a preference for some central bank
              | over none (see Figure 2.6).
              |    In the subsequent two subsections, I provide support for this argument. In the
              | first, I focus on the failure of Republican efforts to establish a central bank. They were
              | also divided over how to proceed with reform and, by the time the two sides could
              | come to a mutually beneficial agreement, they lost control of government. The second
              | subsection turns to focus on the Democrats. Following their takeover of Congress
              | and the White House in 1912, they succeeded where their Republican counterparts
              | had not: quickly coming up with an alternative both preferred to the status quo.
              | With neither Democratic group interested in vetoing the bill, it easily passed in
              | 1913. Though almost all of the literature discussing this original act stops at this
              | point, significant reform of the Fed’s structure was still to come, points discussed in
              | sections 2.3 and 2.4 of this chapter.

              | to do so. While few desired a continuation of the status quo, the party, like the country
              | more broadly, was split on how to proceed with longer-term policy change (Broz 1997,
              | p. 172). At that point, the party’s primary dividing issue was over how currency
              | should be issued, a question with important implications over the expansiveness of
              | the money supply.
              |        Speaking for western and midwestern bankers, Charles Fowler, chairman of the
              | House Committee of Banking and Currency, and his likeminded colleagues advocated
              | giving their districts financial institutions monetary policy autonomy (Wicker 2005,
              | p. 35, 42). Their ideal was to allow these commercial banks to issue currency backed
              | by their own assets (Broz 1997, p. 168). The eastern wing in the party, however, had
              | a different, more restrictive vision. Nelson Aldrich, chairman of the Senate Finance
              | Committee, represented the interests of New York financiers by opposing such asset-
              | based currency, instead preferring currency be issued on the basis of bonds (Wicker
              | 2005, p. 42).
              |        Unable to resolve this difference during the 1908 congressional session, but still
              | wanting to show voters they had done something, the two party’s two divisions ulti-
              | mately compromised and passed the Aldrich-Vreeland Act on May 30, 1908 without
              | any Democratic support.8 This was a stop gap measure, though, with the issue of
              | institutional reform delegated to the National Monetary Commission, a study group
              | created by the act (Shull 2005, p. 40; Wicker 2005, p. 43). This delegation deci-

              | the glare of the public spotlight, the commission would enable interested actors to
              | “coalesce around a unifying institutional program” that would form the basis of a bill
              | “acceptable to the most active constituencies” (Broz 1997, p. 174). What they did
              | not anticipate was that this process would take quite a while.
              |        Per congressional tradition, Aldrich, the sponsor of the bill creating the commis-
              | sion, was put in charge (Broz 1997, p. 173). However, distracted by congressional
              | fights over the tariff and growing public apathy towards banking reform, he made
              | little progress in the group’s first two-and-a-half years (Wicker 2005, p. 50). Fi-
              | nally, in the fall of 1910, Henry Davison, a partner at New York-based JP Morgan &
              | Company, persuaded Aldrich to convene a secret meeting on Jekyll Island, Georgia,
              | where the group could finally hash out a proposal (Wicker 2005, p. 57). To maximize
              | efficiency, these highly secretive meetings were only attended by a few individuals,
              | all with backgrounds on Wall Street.9 This strategy worked well: after a week of
              | meetings, the group had a clear proposal.
              |        Led by Warburg, a German-American immigrant who “strongly advocated” a
              | European-style monetary system, the group called for the creation of a central bank
              | (West 1977, p. 55; Broz 1997, p. 142).10 Their rationale was that the re-establishment
              | of such an institution would eliminate the “perverse elasticity” and “short-term rigid-
              | ity” inherent in the country’s money supply by facilitating transactions among insti-

              | 2014, p. 184). While another policy response likely could have addressed these same
              | issues – for example, Canadian policymakers responded to the panic of 1907 by im-

              | from rural interests would have challenged the political feasibility of such alternatives
              | (ibid, p. 307).
              |        The objective of this proposed central bank – to be called the National Reserve
              | Association – was clear: end the prevailing laissez-faire administration of money. It

              | to-be-formed bank issue currency backed by both gold and commercial paper, thereby
              | indicating that it preferred some discretion over the money supply (Eichengreen 2011,

              | similar to C in Figure 2.2 – they knew that obtaining passage of a bank with such
              | features would be particularly difficult (West 1977, p. 55).11 This difference between
              | what the Aldrich group wanted and what was politically feasible grew much more
              | when the Democrats won control of the House in the 1910 midterm elections just
              | days before the secret meeting in Georgia (McCulley 1992, p. 261). Thus, Aldrich

              |     This group, represented by the leadership of the American Bankers Association,
              | had agreed to support a central bank if it would accept commercial paper as collateral
              | (i.e., endorse asset currency) and avoid control by partisan or Wall Street interests
              | (Wicker 2005, p. 69; Broz 1997, p. 178). This latter proposal reflected this by
              | recommending that the central bank be highly decentralized. Under the Aldrich
              | group’s plan, there would be fifteen regional branches that collectively made decisions
              | on the discount rate but otherwise possessed autonomy (Wicker 2005, p. 69).12 To
              | further cement the informal agreement between the two groups of bankers, the plan
              | was also quite clear in its vision to “get the government out of the banking business”
              | (McCulley 1992, p. 235).13
              |     In essence, Aldrich’s plan (AP), publicly proposed on January 16, 1911, was a
              | compromise between his preferred central bank governance structure (C) and that of
              | his progressive Republican colleagues (B), representing bankers outside of New York
              | and the eastern seaboard. This measure succeeded in one sense: most Republicans,
              | like the broad cross section of bankers they were representing, preferred it to the
              | status quo of no central bank (Broz 1997, p. 184). This logic is illustrated in Fig-

              | allocated across four classes. The first would be the representatives of each branch (15 directors),
              | the second from commercial interests (15), the third selectees of the individual branches (9, but
              | with weighted voting rights), the fourth would come from the federal government (6). This last
              | group, a token to those favoring government participation, would be comprised of the secretary of
              | the treasury, the secretary of commerce and labor, and the comptroller of the currency in addition
              | to three governors to be selected by the president (Broz 1997, p. 181–182).

              | liability of the bank alone (i.e., not the federal government) and, correspondingly, the stock to be
              | held exclusively by member banks. As Aldrich put it, the National Reserve Association would serve
              | as an “agency and tool” of the banks (McCulley 1992, p. 235). The only offering the Aldrich plan
              | made towards those favoring politicization was to grant the president the authority to appoint six
              | members of the thirty-nine member board (ibid).

              | Having gained control of the House of Representatives, the Democrats possessed an

              | election (Shull 2005, p. 41). As the Wall Street Journal put it at the time, “the
              | coming Democratic congress tends to reduce the chances for the establishment of the
              | highly necessary central bank” (WSJ, Nov. 12, 1910). With firm control over the

text          | With all this momentum for the Democrats, the question then became how they
              | would handle monetary reform. Like the Republicans, they first had to overcome
              | their internal division over central banking. William Jennings Bryan, whose “Cross
              | of Gold” speech made monetary policy a lightning-rod issue in the 1896 election, led
              | one side of the party. He appealed to voters in the agrarian west and south that
              | strongly preferred the money supply be controlled by the government, not financial
              | interests (McCulley 1992, p. 268–269; Broz 1997, p. 198).15 Representative Carter
              | Glass (D–VA) served as the leader of the other strand of the party that, like their
              | conservative Democratic predecessor, Grover Cleveland, advocated minimum govern-

              | government and should not be surrendered to banks” (As quoted in Link, 1956, p. 208).

              | preference ellipses since they would rather have control by Washington than control

              | party’s presidential nominee, Woodrow Wilson, positioned himself.
              |    For his part, Wilson campaigned actively, if vaguely, against the Aldrich plan in

              |        Wilson made the safe choice by siding with Glass, who, thanks to Pujo’s retire-
              | ment, was to become chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency
              | in the 63rd Congress. The Glass-led contingent was also more numerous, having pre-

              | 66 in the Democratic caucus earlier that year (McCulley 1992, p. 263). Still, Wil-
              | son’s choice was not taken easily by Samuel Untermyer, counsel for the Congressional
              | “money trust” investigation, and the liberal representatives, who were not pleased
              | to hear that Glass had begun working with the new administration to craft a decen-
              | tralized version of the Aldrich plan (Link 1954, p. 47; McCulley 1992, p. 276). By
              | December 26, Glass had formed a complete proposal and presented it to Wilson. It
              | called for the creation of up to twenty privately controlled reserve banks that would
              | “provide for local or home control” of monetary policy (Willis 1923, p. 145). Glass
              | had proposed a more decentralized central bank than the Aldrich plan, though both
              | offered little monetary policy authority to government actors.16
              |        Liberals, led by Bryan, and Untermyer, were not happy with this proposal. They
              | not only refused to support Glass’s plan in its current form, but also introduced a
              | counterproposal drafted by Secretary William McAdoo to create a bank under his
              | jurisdiction at the Department of the Treasury (Link 1954, p. 47). Though this
              | alternative had little chance of success, it, in combination with their broader rhetoric
              | against the Glass bill, served as an effective signal that the Virginian would have to
              | modify his proposal to gain their support. Doing so was crucial, since, though the

              | Clark were only willing to let legislation get to a floor vote if said bills had first
              | received a clear majority vote in the Democratic caucus. The liberals exercised this

              | Currency refused to report Glass’s bill to the caucus (Link 1954, p. 49).
              |        Following this incident, Wilson realized this intraparty conflict had to be resolved,
              | so he convened a series of meetings with Glass, Robert Owen, the chairman of the
              | new Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, and McAdoo between June 17 and
              | 19. There, he announced that the government would possess exclusive control of the
              | Board and treat the system’s notes as its own obligations.17 In essence, this update,
              | introduced as the Glass-Owen bill on June 26, 1913, maintained Glass’s vision of a
              | decentralized central bank, but moved control, to the extent it existed, from Wall
              | Street to Washington (Broz 1997, p. 198; Willis 1923, p. 250).
              |        This shift is represented in Figure 2.5 below as the move from B (Glass’s orig-
              | inal plan and his ideal structure) to what came to be called the Glass-Owen bill,
              | a compromise between the former and the structural setup preferred by the liberal

              | to move the legislation further towards their ideal, even if they could continue bar-

              | party and therefore the crucial support of the veto-possessing legislators, namely the
              | Democratic members of the two relevant committees. With this pan-party support,
              | the leadership allowed the bill to make it to the floor, where it had more than enough
              | support to be voted through. On September 18, the House passed the bill with 287
              | aye votes and 85 nays (see Table 2.1). Three months later, the Senate followed suit,
              | though with less bipartisan support owing to the scarcity of progressive Republicans
              | in the upper chamber (see Table 2.2). In both cases, Democrats voted overwhelmingly
              | in favor, with only 3 out of a total of 341 voting against the measure.19 Following a

text          |    Since the role of Republicans on the formation of this legislation is a dividing issue
              | between much of the literature and me, I devote one final paragraph to it. Of the 92
              | Republicans from midwestern or western states (in the House and Senate combined)
              | that cast a vote on the bill, 39 of these voted in favor. This ratio – 42% – is consistent
              | with this subset of congresspersons being indifferent between the bill and the status
              | quo (p > 0.10 in a 2-sided binomial test). This (modest) Republican support has
              | led many in the literature to conclude that the bill was explicitly designed to acquire
              | bipartisan support. Again, however, I disagree, since their voting rates are consistent
              | with the idea that the negotiated settlement between the two Democratic groups
              | would produce the same utility for them as the status quo (see R2 ’s indifferent ellipse
              | in Figure 2.6).

text          | The Fed’s trajectory was significantly altered in its early years, particularly by an
              | event it had no control over: World War I. The country’s entrance into that conflict
              | led to the introduction of a new monetary technology: open market operations. Pol-
              | icymakers at the Fed soon discovered that this new policy tool could help smooth
              | economic fluctuations, though it would only be powerful if done in coordination. The
              | start of the Great Depression, another exogenous shock, revealed the extent to which
              | this is true. The Fed’s multiple veto points at the time prevented an adequate mone-
              | tary policy response, a result that exacerbated the extent of the downturn. Unhappy
              | with this policy outcome and wanting to prevent its repetition, many came to favor
              | making the Fed more centralized. Most of those making this move were unwilling to

              | constituents wanted, namely an expansionary supply of money. Instead, they wanted
              | to pair this change with a corresponding increase in the degree of public control (i.e.,
              | increase its politicization). Put simply, this shift (and the subsequent change in struc-

text          | While certainly a landmark piece of legislation, the final version of the Federal Re-
              | serve Act offered only a broad outline concerning the institution’s structure. Final
              | decisions about these details were instead delegated to the Reserve Bank Organizing
              | Committee (RBOC), who ultimately decided which cities would receive a Federal Re-
              | serve bank and exactly how many there would be (they could choose between eight
              | and twelve).20 Following the implementation of the RBOC’s recommendations, the
              | Federal Reserve System became operational on November 16, 1914. Just as Glass and

              | conducting monetary policy in a way that reflected their districts’s unique financial
              | considerations. In the beginning, the only way they were doing so was by altering
              | the rediscount rate, the rate at which they made loans to their member banks by
              | discounting eligible paper (now called the discount rate; Meulendyke 1998, p. 19).

text          |       World War I had two big effects on monetary policy, both of which played a sig-
              | nificant role in the evolution of the Fed. First, oceanic freight came to a near halt.
              | This greatly reduced inflows of gold to the US and led to a fall in the prices of many
              | commodities (Meltzer 2003, p. 82). This decline in the money supply also raised the
              | value of the dollar, which hurt exporters. Second, the country’s dramatic uptick in
              | military spending was not completely offset by increased revenues. The administra-
              | tion turned to debt to finance the difference, increasing the country’s national debt
              | from less than $1 billion (as of 1913) to almost $27 billion (Eccles 1954, p. 167).
              |       Seeking to simultaneously address both of these issues, Treasury Secretary McAdoo
              | turned to the newly created central bank. As the ex officio chairman of the Fed’s
              | board, he got the reserve banks to facilitate the sale of his department’s new “Liberty
              | Loans.” This became the Fed’s “main wartime activity,” with half of Treasury’s debt
              | issues going through the new central bank (Meltzer 2003, p. 85). Realizing it could
              | use this activity led to induce changes in the money supply (Meulendyke 1998, p.
              | 20), the Fed gained an important new tool of monetary policy that it came to rely
              | on more and more. As a result, Federal Reserve bank credit soared (see Figure 2.7)
              | and the supply of money followed suit (Calomiris and Haber 2014, p. 187).21
              |       Benjamin Strong, Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY),
              | realized this instrument could not just “offset undesired changes in gold holdings,”
              | but also “stabilize economic activity” (Meulendyke 1998, p. 22). In other words, these
              | open market operations (i.e., the buying and selling of Treasury securities) could be
              | used as a counter-cyclical policy tool, but only if done in coordination. Meltzer (2003)
              | put it this way: “A more activist policy required more and better information, new
              | procedures, and a new framework for deciding on policy actions” (p. 140).

              | to centralize the Fed (Meltzer 2003, p. 143–146). To do so, he helped created the
              | Governor’s Committee on Centralized Execution of Purchases and Sales of Govern-
              | ment Securities in 1922 (West 1977, p. 224). That nascent body was replaced with

              | olution adopted in March 1923. The idea was that this group would “coordinate
              | purchases and sales of government securities by the twelve district banks” (Patrick

              | the reserve banks of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago (Eccles 1954, p.
              | 169). Nevertheless, it was relatively successful. Led by Strong, the OMIC helped co-

              | to conduct monetary policy so as to not disrupt the gold standard. So while the

              | bill (GO) towards a new, more centralized institution, Q*, it could not go too far
              | since, thanks to this persistence of the gold standard, the central bank still lacked
              | significant policy autonomy. In addition, this institutional change, demonstrated in

text          |       Despite being only a modest change, support for this reform was not ubiquitous.
              | Many at the Fed continued to hold views closely aligned with the real bills doctrine
              | and only reluctantly accepted this move towards centralization and the open market
              | operations it facilitated since they provided a way for the reserve banks to increase
              | their earnings (Meltzer 2003, p. 201). They were not, however, going to tolerate
              | robust purchases since they viewed such actions as inflationary. This divide came to
              | a head shortly after the stock market dramatically collapsed following the series of
              | steep declines culminating in “Black Tuesday” on October 29, 1929.22
              |       At that point, George Harrison, who replaced Strong in New York after the latter’s
              | death a year earlier, tried to get the Fed to employ a similar strategy. This time,
              | however, the central bank was much less successful. Though Harrison was able to
              | overcome significant resistance in persuading the Board to permit the FRBNY to cut
              | its discount rate from 6% to 2.5% (as of August 1930), he was unable to do so in the
              | realm of open market purchases (Friedman and Schwartz 1963, p. 367–368). Since,
              | by then, the latter had eclipsed the former as the most influential tool of monetary
              | policy, the Fed’s overall response to the initial downturn was rather limited (Meltzer
              | 2003, p. 259).
              |       Harrison’s ability to get the Fed to engage in collective action was further limited
              | by the institutional change that replaced the OMIC with the Open Market Policy
              | Conference (OMPC) in May of 1929. Adolph Miller, one of the original members of
              | the Federal Reserve Board, initiated this move with the help of his colleagues adhering
              | to the real bills doctrine following Strong’s death in 1928. Their goal was to use this
              | legal maneuver to dilute the authority of the FRBNY, which they felt had, under
              | Strong’s leadership, increased the level of de facto centralization at the central bank

text          | (Meltzer 2003, p. 195). Put differently, Miller and his allies wanted to reverse the
              | changes that had moved the Fed’s structure from GO to Q*.
              |        In that sense, they were relatively successful. The OMPC expanded the decision-
              | making apparatus, giving each reserve bank a seat at the table, though implemen-
              | tation of the group’s policies was again left to the five reserve banks comprising the
              | OMIC (Patrick 1993, p. 6; Eccles 1954, p. 169). Still, under the OMPC, the board
              | was unable to determine system policies and the governors of the reserve banks were
              | unwilling to engage in robust open market operations (Patrick 1993, p. 13). Thus,
              | by increasing the autonomy of the reserve banks (and decreasing centralization), this
              | institutional restructuring, shown via the dotted arrow featured in the right half of
              | Figure 2.8 above, limited the Fed’s ability to engage in counter-cyclical monetary
              | policy.
              |        In terms of creating conditions conducive to effective monetary policy, this modi-
              | fication was much less successful. The reason for this is simple: the new institutional
              | arrangement gave the governors based outside of New York a policy veto. This was
              | exercised only a month into the new monetary regime, when the executive commit-
              | tee voted down Harrison’s recommendation for continuing purchases of government
              | securities at the rate of $25 million per week (Friedman and Schwartz 1963, p. 369).
              | His attempts to persuade his colleagues to expand this position failed since they were
              | convinced that increasing the money supply further would not help end the reces-
              | sion, which they figured would soon end anyways.23 In other words, many of them
              | were adherents to the real bill doctrine and viewed continued monetary expansion as
              | ineffective in the short-run and inflationary in the long-run.

              | tightness” (Friedman and Schwartz 1963, p. 375–376). At this time, what Bernanke
              | (2004) refers to as the “financial accelerator” took hold. That is, banks suffered losses
              | from these market declines and responded by reducing their lending, which then re-

              | enough Fed officials maintained the belief that monetary policy was not the solution
              | that the central bank did not engage in robust action.
              |    The FRBNY reclaimed significant monetary policymaking authority when Britain
              | left the gold standard on September 19, 1931 since that bank has “always had primary
              | responsibility for international monetary relations” (Friedman and Schwartz 1963, p.
              | 380). However, this did not result in what Harrison had been previously advocating –
              | an aggressive round of asset purchases. Rather, he became primarily concerned with
              | helping the US maintain the gold standard. To prevent gold outflow, the FRBNY’s
              | board of directors raised the discount rate from 1 12 % to 2 12 % at its October 8 meeting
              | and then again to 3 12 % a week later. During this period, Harrison’s “concern about
              | gold inhibited his desire to expand Federal Reserve credit” so asset purchases were
              | fairly limited (ibid, p. 383).
              |    This gold-based constraint was relaxed in the spring of 1932, allowing the Fed to
              | partially overcome its inertia and begin a round of asset purchases of up to $250 mil-
              | lion in securities (Puente 2014). However, only four banks – New York, Philadelphia,
              | Cleveland, and Kansas City – actually chose to participate. This lack of collective
              | action became a binding constraint as the FRBNY decided it could no longer “go

              | were too limited for Harrison to justify its maintenance to his directors. Thus, the
              | Fed began tapering its purchases and the System’s assets “remained almost precisely
              | constant” for the rest of the year (ibid).
              |       Overall, the Fed’s monetary policy following the crash was “almost entirely pas-
              | sive” and, correspondingly, highly ineffective (Friedman and Schwartz 1963, p. 420).

              | tics. Voters turned against the Republican incumbents that had possessed unified con-

              | gained 49 seats (net) and cut the Republicans’ majority in the House to a majority
              | of only two. However, the 72nd House did not convene for another 13 months and,

text          |       In additional to these sweeping changes in the partisan composition of Congress,
              | the Fed’s monetary failure had important implications for the real bills doctrine.
              | Prior to the Great Depression, many Democrats (and some progressive Republicans
              | or those in R2 ) had used the real bills doctrine doctrine to justify their support for
              | a decentralized monetary system and opposition to increased lending by the reserve
              | banks. Since World War I, this group had seen the possibilities offered by counter-
              | cyclical monetary policy – particularly during the responses to the recessions of 1924
              | and 1927 – but its absence was even more powerful.
              |       The dearth of open market operations following the 1929 stock market crash had
              | been exactly what the theory recommended, but obviously had disastrous results
              | (Friedman and Schwartz 1963). Put simply, the economic events between 1929 and

              | mary theoretical justification for this decentralized monetary system (Patrick 1993, p.
              | 10). Thus, most turned against it, instead preferring a more activist monetary policy.
              | As Faust (1996) described, “the desirability of the gold standard anchor was widely
              | questioned, and many key players came to view monetary policy as a discretionary
              | art” (p. 272).
              |        Responding to this “national consensus [against] an automatic monetary policy
              | regime,” President Roosevelt took the country off the gold standard shortly after his
              | inauguration on March 4, 1933 (Laughlin 2004, p. 271).25 Without the constraint
              | of the gold standard, Fed officials were free to pursue policy as they saw fit. How-
              | ever, the system’s would only be able to maximize its recently increased potential to
              | serve a counter-cyclical economic policy tool if its members could agree to engage in
              | coordinated action. As before, though, this remained elusive.
              |        As the Fed continued its pattern of policy inaction, the political context around
              | it, like the country more broadly, was undergoing a significant shift. The decline of
              | the real bills doctrine combined with the ending of the gold standard resulted in more
              | becoming in favor of an activist approach at the Fed in which open market operations
              | were expanded and the supply of money increased. Realizing the Fed’s structure was
              | an institutional burden to such action, calls for reform to the central bank began.
              | Many who had previously favored a diffuse division of power at the Fed came to
              | instead prefer making the central bank more centralized and politicized. Using the
              | language from the preference figures above, most Democrats had come to prefer A
              | (politicized Fed) to B (decentralized Fed) so, for the first time, D2 contained more

              |       That is not to say all underwent this evolution. Carter Glass (D–VA), now a
              | senator, maintained his prior beliefs, continuing to prefer decentralization. Despite
              | becoming a minority in his own party on this issue, he retained power thanks to his
              | appointment as the chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency subcommittee,
              | a position he had held since December 1930. With his party having gained agenda
              | control in both chambers, he could finally pursue the overhaul in banking regulation
              | that he had been working on since assuming that position, though he knew any such
              | legislation would still fail without the support of the resurgent liberal wing of the
              | party.
              |       Working with economist H. Parker Willis, who, like Glass, did not stray from his
              | strong views in line with the real bills doctrine, Glass crafted legislation that he hoped
              | would reduce concentrated financial power and speculation, his chief culprits for the
              | country’s economic malaise (Meltzer 2003, p. 429). With this goal in mind, Glass
              | spent much of his energy on legislation requiring the separation of commercial and
              | investment banks. While, as described above, much of his party had shifted away
              | from Glass’s monetary policy views, the liberal wing of the party could still agree
              | with this move meant to tame New York banks.
              |       For its part, the latter group, led by Henry Steagall (D–AL), the chairman of the
              | House Committee on Banking and Currency and a populist champion of small banks,
              | focused on establishing deposit insurance (Patrick 1993, p. 17; Calomiris and Haber,
              | p. 190). This was a politically popular measure, with many depositors viewing it as a
              | way to recoup the losses they had incurred from the countless bank closures (Meltzer
              | 2003, p. 432).26 Glass had “opposed deposit insurance for years” but eventually

              | the broader bill’s success (Meltzer 2003, p. 433). With this agreement, the two groups
              | created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as part of the Banking
              | Act of 1933.
              |    The last measure the two sides worked to address was that of the Federal Re-
              | serve’s structure. Blaming the FRBNY for exacerbating speculation via its purchases
              | of Treasury securities, Glass sought to diminish its role in the system and limit open
              | market operations more broadly. Other members of the party leadership, such as
              | Steagall, accepted the first part of Glass’s goal, but wanted to pair this change with
              | an expanded role for the Board in D.C. Thus, the compromise the two sides reached
              | mandated that reserve banks could only participate in open market operations if ex-
              | plicitly permitted to do so under board regulations (Krooss 1969, vol. 4, p. 2724-69).
              |    The board also gained authority in regulating banks, with the legislation permit-
              | ting them to investigate any banks (not just members of the Federal Reserve System)
              | under the same corporate umbrella as a member bank. It came to possess the right
              | to limit the interest rate member banks could pay on time deposits as well (Patrick
              | 1993, p. 16). In addition, the board was put in charge of relations between central
              | bankers within and outside the system, taking the place the FRBNY had informally
              | held until then (Patrick 1993, p. 188). This was combined with a move to modestly
              | reduce political control over that group by increasing the tenure of board members
              | from ten to twelve years, though, thanks to Woodin, Roosevelt’s first Secretary of
              | the Treasury, Glass was unable to remove the Treasury Secretary’s seat on the board
              | (Patrick 1993, p. 188–189).
              | and 1933, far fewer banks would have closed and thus the “political pressure for deposit insurance
              | would have remained weak” (p. 433).

text          |    To facilitate the implementation of these changes, the legislation replaced the
              | OMPC with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). While this new body
              | represented “a step away from the idea of semiautonomous reserve banks, it did not
              | abandon local operation” (Meltzer 2003, p. 430). For one, the reserve banks could
              | refuse to participate in open market operations (Kennedy 1973, p. 210). Second,
              | all twelve reserve banks possessed membership in the FOMC and chose an executive
              | committee consisting of the same five members – Boston, New York, Philadelphia,
              | Cleveland, and Chicago – and chairman, Harrison, as had been the case under the
              | OMPC (Meltzer 2003, p. 436). Perhaps most importantly, the board lacked a voice
              | on this new committee and could only approve or disapprove of its decisions after
              | they had been made (Eccles 1954, p. 170).
              |    Though it provided what Glass wanted in the short-run by reducing the power
              | of Harrison and the FRBNY, this was also true across the system, as all the reserve
              | banks lost a degree of autonomy to the board (Meltzer 2003, p. 430). Thus, the
              | creation of the FOMC in 1933 had an important unintended consequence, at least
              | for Glass. For the first time, the political appointees on the board would play a
              | non-trivial role in the conduct of monetary policy. However, few would be happy
              | with this hybrid system in which neither the board nor the reserve banks possessed
              | unbridled control and each side could veto the other. Needless to say, this “crippling”
              | decision-making apparatus did not represent a sustainable equilibrium and it would
              | soon be the target of a more robust reform effort (Patrick 1993, p. 16).

text          | The changes brought about by this reform were only short-lived. Two years later,
              | Congress passed and Roosevelt signed legislation overhauling the Fed’s design. Why
              | did this occur? As first discussed in the previous section, the proximate causes were
              | two exogenous events. First, World War I stimulated the invention of a new policy
              | technology, open market operations, which monetary policymakers discovered could
              | be used to reduce macroeconomic fluctuations. Relatedly, when the Fed’s structure
              | prevented it from engaging in effective counter-cyclical monetary policy following
              | the start of the Great Depression, an impetus for reform emerged. By exposing
              | the fallacies of the real bills doctrine, this second economic shock (the Depression)
              | strengthened the reform movement in another way: many moved towards a preference
              | for a politicized and centralized central bank for the first time.
              |    While necessary, these stimuli were not sufficient to drive the resulting struc-
              | tural change in-and-of-themselves. This is because not everyone became amenable to
              | making the Fed more politicized. This is particularly true among Republicans, who
              | held control in Congress and the White House at the start of the Great Depression.
              | For the Fed to be reformed, two additional conditions would have to be met. First,
              | those unhappy with the status quo would have to replace those content with it (or
              | at least outnumber them). Thanks to the widespread dissatisfaction with incum-
              | bent politicians produced by the Great Depression, this condition was quickly met.
              | Democrats gained large enough majorities in the 1932 elections to possess unified
              | control of government (see Table 2.3 above). The second condition – the removal of
              | veto power from those opposed to the change – would come two years later, after
              | Senate Democrats gained even more seats. This eliminated Carter Glass’s ability to

              |    In the subsections that follow, I offer a narrative account of the legislative process
              | that culminated in the Banking Act of 1935, the legislation that reformed the Fed.
              | To further establish the causality of the factors that I argue are behind this structural
              | revision, I conclude this section with a set of counterfactual analyses. These reveal
              | that without these factors, the change either would not have happened or at least
              | not have been as profound. An additional counterfactual exercise suggests that what
              | much of the listerature (e.g., Patrick 1993) attributes as a primary cause of the reform
              | – the policy entrepreneurship of Roosevelt’s representative at the Fed, Marriner Eccles
              | – was really just a reaction to the political environment at the time. So while it
              | certainly helped ease the legislation’s passage, it is unlikely that the legislation would
              | have failed without it.

blank         | 
text          | Following the passage of the Glass-Steagall bill in 1933, there was initially little
              | interest from the administration in initiating reform, much less a robust one. Patrick
              | (1993) put it this way: “if the system had been on trial during 1933 and early 1934,
              | Roosevelt must have acquitted the defendant [since ...] after devaluation he told [Fed
              | officials] Black and Harrison the reserve banks had acted satisfactorily and that he
              | would do nothing to decrease the system’s influence or its power” (p. 233).
              |    This was not the case in Congress, though. A plan created by a group of economists
              | at the University of Chicago (the “Chicago Plan”) calling for the Fed to be replaced
              | by a to-be-created government-run “Federal Monetary Authority” was gaining trac-
              | tion (Palmer 2010, p. 268). Alan Goldsborough and Bronson Cutting, members of

              | islation in the second session of the 73rd Congress and gained support from several
              | liberal Democrats and progressive Republicans (Phillips 1994, p. 558–559).
              |    Though this coalition comprised a minority of Congress, it still prompted the
              | administration to begin considering how to improve the conduct of monetary policy,
              | even before Eccles became involved. Morgenthau convened a group of experts in
              | finance and banking to consider if and how to reform the nature of monetary policy
              | in the country. This group, which became known as the “Freshmen Brain Trust,”
              | spoke enthusiastically of the Federal Monetary Authority in the report they submitted
              | to Morgenthau in September 1934 (Phillips 1994, p. 559). However, by that time,
              | the Treasury Secretary had already become more invested in another committee he
              | started, the Interdepartmental Loan Committee, that would focus more broadly on
              | an omnibus banking bill.
              |    Aware of this interest in reform, officials at the Fed established their own group,
              | the System Committee for Legislative Suggestions, in the summer of 1934 to prepare
              | for what they saw as an approaching legislative debate on their institution. Harrison
              | (from the FRBNY) served as chair of a reserve bank-heavy committee and only one
              | member came from the board, Vice Governor J.J. Thomas (Meltzer 2003, p. 469).
              | However, quite unlike the others interested in the subject, they wanted any subsequent
              | legislative reform of their institution to preserve their operational autonomy.
              |    As this debate began to unfold, Marriner S. Eccles, a prominent banker in Utah,
              | had started to gain a reputation as an outspoken advocate of counter-cyclical eco-
              | nomic policy. Shortly before Roosevelt’s inauguration in 1933, he met with Stuart
              | Chase, a “Roosevelt administration brain truster,” during the latter’s trip to Salt

text          | Lake City (Kettl 1986, p. 47). Chase was enthusiastic about Eccles’s potential as
              | a valuable ally for the incoming administration and recommended that Eccles meet
              | with Rexford Tugwell during an upcoming trip to the East Coast. That meeting went
              | quite well and by February 24, Eccles was in Washington testifying in favor of ag-
              | gressive government spending in front of the Senate Committee on Finance (Patrick
              | 1993, p. 252).
              |        Subsequent to this successful trip, Henry Morgenthau, Jr., Roosevelt’s second
              | Secretary of the Treasury, asked Eccles to join him at 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue
              | as a full-time advisor. For the next year-and-a-half, Eccles worked closely with the
              | administration’s top economic officials on the National Housing Act, Reconstruction
              | Finance Corporation, and various other New Deal programs (Patrick 1993, p. 252).
              | Eccles was also an active administration surrogate at the legislative branch, working,
              | for example, with the conference committee deliberating over the FDIC Act of 1934
              | in the waning days of the 73rd Congress (Patrick 1993, p. 200.57).
              |        Then, in the summer of 1934, Roosevelt began looking for a new chair of the
              | Federal Reserve. His previous chairman, Eugene Black, had agreed in 1933 to take
              | over temporarily, but was eager to return to his old (higher paying) job as governor of
              | the Atlanta Fed. That September, Roosevelt interviewed Eccles for the job. Though
              | eager to make his mark on monetary policy, the Utahan was not willing to accept any
              | offer to take over the central bank unless the president would commit to substantive
              | reforms of the central bank, highlighted by consolidating power in the board and,
              | more specifically, the chairman.27

text          | and, on November 4, 1934, Eccles presented the president with a memo on the topic
              | (Eccles 1951, p. 173). In it, he argued that as it stood now, the Fed’s “diffusion
              | of power” made “inertia and indecision [inevitable]” (Eccles 1934, p. 2). He also
              | pointed out how the actors with the most formal decision-making authority – the
              | twelve reserve bank governors on the FOMC – “cannot help” but make monetary
              | policy decisions with narrow banking interests, rather than broader social welfare in
              | mind (ibid).
              |    Eccles’s solution can be boiled down to a single recommendation: power should be
              | consolidated at the reserve board in D.C., with this group having “complete control
              | over the timing, character, and volume of open market operations” (Eccles 1934, p.
              | 1). He also argued that the reserve bank governors should not just be junior partners
              | of the board in policy implementation, but also formally subordinate to them: he
              | advocated giving the board the right to veto the appointment of any governor.
              |    Eccles was clear about his motivation for these structural reforms. If these changes
              | could be implemented, monetary policy would finally be made to benefit the public’s
              | interest. In other words, greater centralization and politicization of the Fed’s structure
              | would facilitate effective counter-cyclical monetary policy and the use of monetary
              | policy to expand economic activity (Egbert 1967, p. 72). Put differently, these
              | reforms would help prevent the monetary inaction that exacerbated the depths of the
              | Great Depression, a point Eccles’s advisor, Lauchlin Currie, had just made in the
              | academic literature (Currie 1934).
              |    In addition to these long-term benefits, Eccles also pointed out that this reform
              | would be of more immediate help to Roosevelt. He explained to the president how
              | empowering the board would facilitate the $4 billion relief package the White House

text          | was preparing to request from Congress. As Eccles (1954) describes, under the system
              | created by the Banking Act of 1933, “a group of private individuals in the reserve
              | banks had the latent power to block [this] program by damming needed funds by
              | withholding the sort of action in Federal Reserve operations that could maximize”
              | the program’s benefits (p. 187).
              |       Had Eccles not insisted on the importance of these changes, Roosevelt may not
              | have come to have supported them as quickly as he did, but he was always likely to do
              | so in the long-run. Eccles’s vision lined up nicely with his administration’s broader
              | economic agenda and Roosevelt agreed to support Eccles in both his confirmation
              | and reform efforts. He nominated Eccles to the board’s chairmanship less than a
              | week later. Eccles formally took office on November 15, 1934, serving initially in a
              | recess appointment since Congress adjourned months earlier.
              |       Per Roosevelt’s promise to Eccles, the administration quickly began planning com-
              | prehensive banking legislation. On November 26, 1934, Morgenthau announced his
              | Interdepartmental Loan Committee, staffed with representatives from all bureaucratic
              | agencies involved in banking, would be submitting a new omnibus banking bill in the
              | new year. By January, the committee delivered on its promise and quickly gained
              | Roosevelt’s endorsement. The specific (and primary) changes it made regarding the
              | Fed’s structure – meant to bring it in line with Eccles’s ideal of a powerful central
              | bank with limited private bank influence – are as follows:28

text          |        Similar to those in the Aldrich plan proposed in 1910, this set of recommendations
              | was not as sweeping as Eccles seemingly would have liked, but still close enough to his
              | ideal and likely sufficiently moderate to appeal to the whole party.31 To ensure that
              | this was the case, the administration decided to combine these structural proposals
              | with two other popular measures. The first, to become Title I of the combined bill,
              | involved an extension to the newly formed FDIC, while the other, Title III, focused

text          |        The choice posed to Congress, then, would be a clear one: should these reforms –
              | including strengthening the board – be passed or should the Fed maintain its thereto-
              | fore structure and the country revert to a banking system without deposit insurance?
              | There were costs and benefits associated with this approach. The risk was that by
              | taking a hardline on the non-excludability of this “sandwich” legislation, the ad-
              | ministration would not get its other banking reforms passed if Congress could not
              | be persuaded that they needed to increase the politicization and centralization of
              | the Fed. But that was more than offset by the benefits of doing so: combining all
              | three aspects into one bill changed legislators’ decision-making calculus. Members of
              | Congress still preferring decentralization (those in the now-smaller D1 ) would only be

              |        This divide was not particularly salient, though, in the House. The leadership in
              | the lower chamber was united in favor of the legislation and the few of the party’s
              | 300-plus rank-and-file members expressed a reluctance to support it. In addition, the
              | bill’s pathway through committee was facilitated by the public endorsement of its
              | chairman, Henry Steagall, and second-ranking leader, Alan Goldsborough (D–MD)
              | (Egbert 1967, p. 110). This process even resulted in the bill becoming more slightly
              | liberal. The committee added a mandate that the Fed pursue economic stability
              | and expanded the power of the board by increasing the ratio of board members to
              | governors from 3:2 to 8:5 (Egbert 1967, p. 111). These changes resulted in the
              | submission of a new, otherwise similar bill, H.R. 7617.
              |        For their part, the bill’s opponents, led by committee ranking member John Hollis-
              | ter (R–OH) and Everett Dirksen (R–IL), repeatedly tried to stop the bill in committee
              | or at least alter it, but lacked the ability to do so. When it came time for the com-
              | mittee to approve the legislation, the 17 Democrats on it all voted in favor, while
              | the 7 Republicans did the opposite (Egbert 1967, p. 111–112). From there, the bill
              | went to the floor of the House, where Hollister continued his efforts to weaken Title
              | II, provision-by-provision. His efforts were again in vain, however. Each of his four

text          | The situation was much different in the Senate, where Carter Glass, who continued
              | – as he had since drafting the legislation creating the Fed in 1912 – to prefer de-
              | centralization. Having played such an important role in the system’s creation, Glass
              | “regarded the system as his personal property” and was reluctant to see it change
              | (Patrick 1993, p. 17). Moreover, any move away from the Fed’s extant structure
              | would decrease his utility, a point he eagerly made to demonstrate his unambiguous
              | opposition to the administration’s banking bill.
              |    This was not an idle threat either. Though he had chosen to chair the Senate
              | Appropriations committee instead of the Currency and Banking one following the
              | Democrats’ takeover in the Senate in 1933, in matters of banking he maintained de
              | facto control in the upper chamber thanks to his colleagues deference to him (Meltzer
              | 2003, p. 429; Patrick 1993, p. 167). As Senator Couzens put it, “most of us [senators]
              | rely upon Senator Glass [in this policy area since he] knows that subject better than

              | 
text          | any of us” (as quoted in Patrick 1993, p. 17). Thus, the bill’s passage hinged on
              | ensuring this pattern of Glass dominating banking and monetary regulation in the
              | upper chamber did not persist; if it did, the reforms would surely fail.
              |        As a first move, Glass set out to test the administration’s commitment to an
              | omnibus bill. Like the rest of the committee, he supported the measures in the bill
              | not pertaining to the Fed – Titles I and III – and figured, if he could introduce
              | them on their own, he could avoid Eccles’s reforms to the institution he had helped
              | create (Egbert 1967, p. 130). However, this initial effort failed: Morgenthau realized
              | Glass’s strategy and had Roosevelt send the full bill to Congress, where the two
              | relevant committee chairmen – Steagall in the House and Duncan U. Fletcher (D–FL)
              | – formally introduced them as H.R. 5357 and S. 1715 before Glass could introduce
              | his alternative legislation (Patrick 1993, p. 256).
              |        From here, the question became which body would gain jurisdiction over the
              | newly introduced bill. Reflecting tradition, the Senate banking committee voted
              | unanimously to give jurisdiction over the administration’s banking bill and Eccles’s
              | confirmation to the Subcommittee on Monetary Policy, Banking, and Deposit Insur-
              | ance that Glass chaired.33 While not unexpected, this move expanded his de jure
              | authority and ability to veto the legislation he was so against.
              |        With this recently solidified leverage, Glass began his campaign to defeat the bill
              | by defeating Eccles himself – that is, sink his confirmation. Though his opposition
              | stemmed from strong differences of opinion over the ideal structure of the Fed, Glass
              | focused the confirmation hearings on Eccles’s eligibility. He insinuated that Eccles
              | was ineligible due to alleged ties with his former banks in Utah, though he lacked

              |       Still, this may not have mattered had the hearings been held by the same body in
              | the previous Congress. Glass’s subcommittee was then composed of two Democrats
              | (Glass and McAdoo) and two Republicans (Townsend and Walcott) opposed to Ec-
              | cles’s proposed reforms, while only one member, Robert J. Bulkley (D–OH), sup-
              | ported them (and him). Following the 1934 election, however, the subcommittee
              | came to have more supporters than opponents.
              |       Three Republicans members of the broader banking committee in the 73rd Congress
              | gave up their seats following the 1934 midterm elections. Hamilton Kean (NJ), Fred-
              | eric Walcott (CT), and Phillip Lee Goldsborough (MD) all were strong proponents of
              | eastern banking interests and would have opposed Eccles and his proposed reforms,
              | but lost their seats to Democrats.34 The liberal Democrats elected to the seats pre-
              | viously held by the latter two – Francis Maloney and George Radcliff, respectively
              | – replaced their predecessors on the banking committee as well. Kean’s seat on the
              | committee was filled by a Republican, albeit a progressive one: Senator Bronson Cut-
              | ting (NM). He held views quite unlike those of his predecessor, going as far as calling
              | for the nationalization of the Federal Reserve system (Phillips 1994).35
              |       Fletcher then used this shift in the overall composition of the committee (i.e., going
              | from 12 to 14 Democrats and 8 to 6 Republicans) to justify changes in Glass’s sub-
              | committee. Per Glass’s request, Walcott’s spot was filled by Senator James Couzens
              | (R–MI), who had already served as a member of the overall committee and seems
              | to have gained Glass’s respect there thanks to his expressions of similar views. For
              | instance, Couzens criticized the Federal Reserve as early as 1927 for encouraging “a

              | Glass that he would oppose Eccles upon being added. When the time came to make
              | a decision, he did not seek Glass’s advice, turning instead to Charles L. McNary (R–
              | OR), the liberal Republican leader of the Senate, who advised him to vote for Eccles
              | (Weldin 2000, p. 63).
              |        Importantly, this was not the only change Fletcher, a staunch administration
              | ally and reliable partner in financial reform efforts, made (Eccles 1954, p. 200-222;
              | Egbert 1967, p. 144). On February 5, 1935, he announced the addition of three
              | more additions to Glass’s subcommittee, all of whom were strong supporters of the
              | New Deal: Cutting, James F. Byrnes (D–SC) and John H. Bankhead (D–AL). Done
              | “without Senator Glass’s approval, and, it was said, without his knowledge,” this was
              | a deliberate attempt to reduce the Virginian’s power on the subcommittee.36
              |        This compositional shift ultimately played a critical role in preventing Glass from
              | vetoing Eccles’s confirmation. It flipped the subcommittee’s alignment and supporters
              | came to outnumber the opponents by a tally of five to three when that ratio had
              | previously been one to four (see Table 2.6).37 This group thus looked past the paltry
              | evidence Glass presented in opposition of Eccles and sided with the administration
              | over Glass in this confirmation fight. On April 23, the subcommittee cleared Eccles by
              | a vote of four in favor to three opposed, including Glass, the chairman. Acknowledging
              | defeat, Glass then gave up on Eccles’s confirmation, showing up to neither the full
              | committee meeting, where Eccles was approved unanimously, nor the floor debate
              | over the confirmation. As a result, Eccles was easily confirmed by the overall Senate

              |       To be clear, this was only possible because of the 1934 senatorial elections. Had
              | the Senate’s Democratic to (conservative) Republican ratio not shifted, Cutting would
              | have stayed off the Banking committee altogether and Byrnes and Bankhead would
              | not have been added to the Glass subcommittee. Put differently, Eccles’s confirmation
              | was only possible thanks to the 1934 election that further reduced the power of eastern
              | Republicans and empowered in their place progressives and liberal Democrats.
              |       Though necessary, this compositional change was not sufficient in-and-of-itself
              | to get Eccles through the subcommittee. Had a majority of the Republicans on it
              | not supported him, he would never have been confirmed. In that sense, the partial
              | splintering of the Republican party following the 1932 election was just as necessary in
              | ensuring his confirmation. Specifically, three of the Republicans on the subcommittee
              | Couzens, Cutting, and Norbeck were part of a group of “senatorial insurgents from
              | [the west] [who] made common cause with the Roosevelt administration” (Morris
              | 1960, p. 2). This progressive bloc, led by Norbeck, the committee’s chairman prior
              | to Fletcher and Republican ranking member in the 74th Congress, did so since much
              | of the New Deal “extended governmental powers to solve economic problems” (Fite
              | 1948, p. 2; Horowitz 1997, p. 13). Eccles helped ensure that this was also true in
              | the realm of monetary policy by submitting a supplemental report to Couzens and
              | the rest of the subcommittee detailing how the Fed would have acted differently (and
              | more successfully) had its structure in 1929 resembled the one he was proposing.
              | This documented helped assuage any concerns of these senators and consolidated
              | their support for his plan (Nelson 2012, p. 298).

              | drastically, and executive officers of national banks with outstanding debts to their
              | institutions would be severely penalized. Few wanted either of these to occur and
              | would both be solved by the other parts of the omnibus banking bill. Glass thought
              | that if he could delay action on Title II (Eccles’s proposed reforms) and pass the
              | popular Titles I and III, he would be able to defeat the reforms when they came
              | up for a vote on their own later (Meltzer 2003, p. 479). While Glass was able to
              | postpone hearings on Eccles’s full confirmation or the banking bill for a while, his
              | plan was never destined to succeed.39
              |           For Glass’s plan to work, we would have to not only gain the support of the rest of
              | the Senate, but also the House of Representatives and President Roosevelt, who would
              | have to sign Titles I and III on their own. Eccles and his supporters in the White
              | House made it clear that they would not go along with it, standing resolute behind
              | the omnibus package. “Confronted by a direct Presidential request, and backed by

              | of the unwanted changes by sixty days (Meltzer 2003, p. 483; Patrick, p. 264).
              |       Glass’s final move was to convince his colleagues on this subcommittee that Ec-
              | cles’s proposal was counterproductive to economic growth. As Kress (1935) put it,
              | Glass “challenged the validity of the philosophy apparently underlying Title II of the
              | bill, and in this connection solicited the views of a number of leading economists and
              | bankers.” Bankers from James Warburg of the Bank of Manhattan to Elwyn Evans
              | of the clearing houses in Wilmington, Delaware railed against Title II’s attempts at
              | centralization of monetary policy power (Egbert 1967, p. 128). Support for this view
              | was offered by a bevy of academic economists, such as Edwin W. Kemmerer of Prince-
              | ton, Oliver M.W. Sprague, and H. Parker Willis of Columbia, who testified against
              | what they saw as the dangers of a politicization of monetary policy. The Economists’
              | National Committee on Monetary Policy, a group composed of 59 leading economists,

              | to Title II of the Banking Bill of 1935.” These warnings failed to achieve their desired
              | result, though, and momentum towards passage persisted.
              |       This was in no doubt due in large part to the continued public support of Roo-
              | sevelt and Morgenthau. In fact, Roosevelt got Morgenthau to suggest to Glass’s
              | subcommittee that the bill could push further towards politicization, going as far as
              | saying he was personally in favor of at least partial government ownership of reserve
              | bank stock (Patrick 1993, p. 280).40 The goal in doing so was to get Glass to realize
              | that, though it may be difficult, the administration could likely get reform passed
              | without his support, in which case it would be even extreme, so he would be best

text          | Faced with this string of defeats, Glass agreed to this trade, realizing that if he could
              | not beat the coalition in favor, it would best for him to join them. By doing so, he
              | could reduce the degree to which the bill would deviate from his ideal and therefore
              | mitigate the decrease in his utility its passage would produce. Thus, we should not
              | interpret Glass’s work on the bill as an approval of the changes and a “puzzling”
              | change of heart from his theretofore support of decentralization, as Calomiris (2010,
              | p. 551) does. Rather, he was simply acting as a rational actor seeking to maximize
              | his utility in a constrained context.
              |    To do so, he worked with his subcommittee to amend the bill (S. 1715), which
              | they finished on June 21 and submitted it to the full committee on July 1. This
              | process brought forth several changes to the bill meant to reduce the politicization
              | brought about by Title II.
              |    The first and most noticeable change was to replace the two ex officio members of
              | the board with one new board member. Put different, the Secretary of the Treasury
              | and the Comptroller of the Currency would no longer have a formal role at the Fed
              | and the board would be comprised solely of seven members each appointed by the
              | President. This move also affected the recommended ratio of board members to
              | governors on the FOMC, reducing it to 7:5 from 8:5 in the House version (Egbert
              | 1967, p. 130–131).
              |    This potential impact of this change was greatly expanded by an added provision

              | 
              | 
text          | preventing more than four of these board members from being of the same party. The
              | combination of these two modifications could catalyze the formation of a majority
              | block on the FOMC with interests not aligned to the president’s. That is, the five
              | reserve bank governors could partner with the three members of the board from
              | the opposite party of the president to form a coalition of eight that could not be
              | counterbalanced by the four co-partisans of the president.
              |    The subcommittee implemented other changes to the bill to further decrease po-
              | tential politicization. It extended the terms of board members to 14 years and im-
              | plemented a one-term limit. Glass’s revised bill also changed the frequency of the
              | chair’s reappointment. In both the original plan and the House plan, that position
              | would be filled yearly; in his, this would happen every four years and would not be
              | altered by the presidential electoral calendar (Eccles 1935).
              |    The subcommittee made two other changes meant to reduce the expansionary
              | effect on the money supply that the House bill would have. It removed the provision
              | allowing Federal Reserve banks to discount on any sound assets. It also raised the
              | threshold the board needed to alter reserve requirements by mandating that any
              | such action would have to be supported by 5 of the 7 (Egbert 1967, p. 131). With
              | the aforementioned partisan identification quotas, this would further constrain the
              | president’s influence on monetary policy.
              |    Needless to say, Eccles, the administration, and their allies in Congress would have
              | preferred that these changes not been made. Still, they represented an unambigu-
              | ous improvement from the status quo of a decentralized Fed. For Glass and fellow
              | Democrats still advocating an adherence to the real bills theory, the new bill was a
              | clear improvement over the House version. Their utility would be considerably lower

              | colleagues in the broader Currency and Banking Committee unanimously accepted
              | Glass’s updates to the bill and sent it to the floor. Once there, the bill passed with

              | ditional political appointee would be added, bringing the total to seven. Also per the
              | Senate version, these members’ non-renewable terms would be raised from 12 to 14
              | years, with the chairman and vice-chairman appointed to those leadership positions
              | every four years. Glass scored another win by keeping the geographic qualifications
              | for board membership in place, thereby promoting decentralization. In aggregate,
              | these changes helped reduce the increases in politicization made by the House bill,
              | thereby making it more in line with Glass’s vision.
              |        Glass also claimed to have won on the composition of the FOMC. The conference
              | committee decided this policymaking body would be composed of all seven board
              | members along with representatives from five of the twelve reserve banks (Patrick
              | 1993, p. 268). Though this reflects the revisions he made during the subcommittee
              | markup process, it would be incorrect to conclude that this was a change he desired.
              | After all, this new setup eliminated the monopoly the reserve banks had held on
              | the Fed’s primary decision-making body.42 Following the bill’s passage, the reserve
              | banks would be outnumbered by the Board. More importantly, the FOMC would
              | no longer be distinguished by its complex web of veto possibilities that promoted
              | decision-making paralysis following the Banking Act of 1933. Specifically, reserve
              | banks lost their autonomy: they would now be obligated to participate in all open
              | market operations, as decided upon by the FOMC.43 Such operations would also be
              | expanded by the committee making “permanent the authority to use government
              | securities as collateral for reserve notes” (Patrick 1993, p. 268). The same would

              | eligible collateral for such loans, which were also to become subject to board approval
              | (Meltzer 2003, p. 485).
              |        The claim that the legislation implemented Glass’s objectives becomes even more
              | specious once one fully accounts for the biggest change induced by the bill: the
              | empowerment of the Board. In addition to gaining control of a more authoritative
              | FOMC, the board could now also unilaterally set reserve requirements, which, until
              | recently, was a primary tool of monetary policy. As the House version had dictated,
              | this could occur with a simple majority vote of the board (4 of the 7). Glass had
              | thus failed in his effort to raise this threshold to 5 of the 7, which was itself still a
              | significant deviation from his ideal of keeping such power in the hands of the reserve
              | banks themselves. The Board also gained veto power over who was to lead the reserve
              | banks. Once the district bank’s directors had appointed a new president (the new
              | name for these positions, previously called governors), that individual could not start
              | his five-year term until approved by the Board of Governors.
              |        Glass had tried to counteract this move towards centralization by taking an ag-
              | gressive stance towards the president’s ability to control the board. This also failed.
              | The provision he added in the subcommittee’s revisions restricting membership on
              | the board to no more than four members of the same political party was stripped out,
              | as was another he inserted mandating at least two members come from the private
              | banking community.44 Even the main provision he had managed to keep to reduce
              | politicization (i.e., the 14-year nonrenewable terms) lacked full bite thanks to a large
              | loophole. That is, board members first appointed to fill an unexpired term could then

              | 1958 and another Roosevelt supporter on the board – Matt S. Szymczak – to remain
              | there until 1961. The four-year cycles for chair also did not do much to reduce the
              | ties between the administration and Eccles as the latter was reappointed as chair in
              | each of Roosevelt’s three re-election years: 1936, 1940, and 1944.
              |        Once the conference committee had finalized this set of agreements on Friday,
              | August 16, they referred the bill back to their two chambers, both of which promptly
              | accepted the final bill, though no votes were recorded. The next Monday, President
              | Roosevelt signed it into law. Though the final legislation may not have gone as far
              | as Eccles and the administration had hoped, it still greatly increased the degree of
              | centralization and politicization at the Fed. It also went much further in this direction
              | than Glass had desired. As Figure 2.10 below demonstrates, the final version of the bill
              | (FB) is unambiguously closer to Eccles’s ideal (A) than what Glass’s subcommittee
              | had proposed (GA). As Nelson (2012) put it, “nearly all of the fundamental changes
              | that Eccles wished to make in the System were achieved to one extent or another”
              | (p. 313).45
              |        The difference between the initial proposal and the what was actually passed can
              | be attributed mostly to the work of Carter Glass, though it would be a mistake to
              | overstate his role. That is, this set of reforms actually decreased his utility since
              | it moved the structure of the Fed away from his ideal of a central bank in which
              | decision-making authority is highly diffuse. Similarly, his public credit claiming for the
              | bill (see Nelson 2012, p. 312) should instead be viewed as an attempt to maintain his

text          |     Schlesinger (2003) echoes this sentiment: “the Banking Act of 1935 was, in every essential

              | control, his determination to transfer control of the money market from New York to Washington,
              | survived intact. With the new law, the national government acquired indispensable powers for the

              | cles, the compositional changes in Congress, and the exogenous events (WWI and the
              | Great Depression). I suggest the first factor – what the literature calls Eccles’s policy
              | entrepreneurship – was not a necessary condition for the reform since Congress had
              | already begun debating this issue on its own since a majority had become amenable to
              | structural reform. Thus, while Eccles’s leadership and the administration’s support
              | helped facilitate the legislation’s passage, we cannot definitively say that it would not
              | have passed without it.46 The second test concerns the importance of the ideological
              | and partisan composition of Congress. For the first several years of the Depression,
              | Congress was controlled by Republicans, whose utilities would not be improved by
              | these structural revisions. Thus, the change in government following the 1932 election
              | was a necessary condition, though so was the further leftward shift in 1934 since that
              | eliminated the veto power of Glass, a key opponent. Finally, I show how there is no
              | reason to believe that Congress in 1935 was measurably more liberal than it was in
              | 1913. Thus, the divergence in policy outcome regarding the Fed’s structure cannot be
              | attributed to the composition of Congress alone. The factor that did change between
              | these two Congresses (the 63rd in 1913 and the 74th in 1935) was preferences over
              | central bank structure, which can be reasonably attributed to the creation of open
              | market operations in WWI and the decline of the real bills doctrine after the start of
              | the Great Depression.

blank         | 
text          | I start with the role of Marriner Eccles. The question here is had Eccles not introduced
              | his reform, would the Fed’s structure today be different?
              |    One way in which we can establish that he played a causal role as a policy en-
              | trepreneur is if there is evidence that further reform of the Fed’s structure would not
              | have occurred without him and his proposal. As discussed above, there was already
              | momentum for reform when Eccles became chairman. Thus, we can reasonably con-
              | clude that, with or without Eccles in a position of authority, the subject of the ideal
              | structure of Federal Reserve would have been on the 74th Congress’s agenda.
              |    The next question then is whether the precise nature of the reform – represented
              | as FB in Figure 2.10 above – would have been different without Eccles. On the
              | surface, the answer appears to be an easy one. Since few had publicly endorsed what
              | he proposed at the time he did, we are tempted to say that this was indeed the case.
              |    However, that ignores the reality that the two sides building momentum on this
              | issue were on either side of him. The Chicago plan proposed a slightly more extreme
              | version on what Eccles did, while the Fed’s System Committee for Legislative Sug-
              | gestions countered with a plan to minimize politicization and maintain reserve bank
              | autonomy. Thus, we cannot rule out that Eccles’s plan was not exogenous, but rather
              | the result of shrewd political calculus.
              |    The final element to consider here then is whether Eccles played a vital role in
              | tipping the scales in favor of the proposal he did propose. In this sense, Eccles also
              | appears to have played an important role in getting the legislation through Congress.
              | Exemplifying this, Eccles’s aforementioned memo to Senators Couzens helped con-
              | vince the progressive from Michigan and his like-minded Republican colleagues that

text          | his reform would lead to policy outcomes in line with their constituents’ interests.
              |    Again, however, the question that ultimately matters is whether he was the only
              | one who could have ameliorated the doubts of these initial skeptics. We cannot defi-
              | nitely conclude that to be the case. After all, even before Eccles, there was a group of
              | administration officials and advisors who supported the idea of counter-cyclical fiscal
              | policy and, correspondingly, reforming the Fed’s structure (Meltzer 2003, p. 420).
              | This group was composed of Lauchlin Currie, a member of Morgenthau’s Freshmen
              | Brain Trust, Harold Ickes, the Secretary of the Interior, and Harry Hopkins, Roo-
              | sevelt’s federal relief administrator (Palmer 2010, p. 273). This group’s policy ideas
              | had already been implemented in the first wave of the New Deal so it would be remiss
              | to ignore their potential contributions had Eccles not been present.
              |    Overall, given Eccles’s central role in getting the Banking Act of 1935 passed,
              | many are inclined to conclude the bill would not have passed without him. Raymond
              | Clapper articulated this view in the Review of Reviews following the bill’s passage:
              | had the weather been more cooperative during Roosevelt advisor Stuart Chase’s visit
              | to Utah, Eccles would not have had the opportunity to deliver an impromptu speech
              | about economic policy in front of him, an event that led to Eccles making his way
              | to Washington and starting the process that led to the reform of the Fed. Thus, “a
              | lot of important people in the East” that opposed the legislation wished Chase had
              | gone the other direction and Eccles never made that speech (as quoted in Eccles 1954,
              | p. 230). Palmer (2010) reaches a similar conclusion, arguing that this outcome was
              | driven by Eccles’s apparently exogenous “supply” of this policy and would not have
              | occurred without it (p. 291–296).
              |    However, as I have discussed in the paragraphs above, had Eccles never come to

text          | Washington (i.e., those “eastern” opponents gotten their wish), the banking reform
              | would still likely have unfolded in much the same manner. Contrary to what Palmer
              | (2010) claims, this “supply” cannot have caused the outcome since it was itself a
              | response to the economic and political climate at the time. In other words, Eccles’s
              | alleged policy entrepreneurship was an endogenous phenomenon lacking truly causal
              | importance.

blank         | 
text          | That there was momentum for reform building even before Eccles and the adminis-
              | tration formally proposed it was not random. As discussed in sections 2.3.3 and 2.4.2
              | above, there was sweeping changes in the partisan makeup of Congress. Prior to
              | the convening of the 72nd Congress on December 7, 1931, Republicans had possessed
              | unified control of government since 1921. And when the Democrats won majorities in
              | both houses as well as the White House in 1932, it was the first time they had unified
              | control since 1918. The Democrats then expanded their majorities in Congress two
              | years later.
              |    While these elections clearly had an impact on the composition of Congress, that
              | still does not prove that this was a necessary condition for the reform to pass. To
              | determine if this was indeed the case, I test a simple counterfactual, asking whether
              | the reform could have passed had the composition of Congress not changed. In other
              | words, could Eccles’s proposal have passed in a previous session of Congress?
              |    To answer this question, I use a no parametric bootstrap procedure. I first sample
              | with replacement from the population of the members of the House that voted on
              | the bill. I then fit a logistic regression of the House vote based on the participating

              | policymakers’ underlying ideology, as measured by Poole and Rosenthal (1997), the
              | data tell a slightly different story. According to the these scores, the average member
              | in the House in 1913 was marginally more liberal on the (general) economic (first)
              | dimension than in 1935 (p < 0.10; see Table 2.10). This is also true when looking
              | just at Democrats. The median member of the Democratic caucus in 1913 has a DW-
              | nominate first-dimension score of -0.334, while his counterpart in 1935 is estimated
              | to have a -0.158 (see Figure 2.13 in the Appendix for a visualization of this). This
              | pattern is even more apparent when focusing on Poole and Rosenthal’s (1997) second
              | dimension. In both cases, the average member (and median Democrat) are estimated
              | to have been more racially progressive, an unsurprising finding since the party had
              | less of a presence in the south prior to the New Deal.

              | Figure 2.14 in the Appendix below demonstrates this: the estimated number of “yea”
              | votes in both houses is well above the minimum threshold needed for the bill to pass.
              | Thus, we can reasonably conclude that a change in the general ideological composition
              | of Congress did not drive this significant change in policy outcome.
              |    That difference must have instead been driven by another factor that changed in
              | the 21.5 years that passed between the passage of the two bills. The candidates here
              | are the obvious ones: World War I and the Great Depression. As discussed in detail
              | above, the former demonstrated how open market operations and an activist approach
              | to monetary policy more broadly could help smooth macroeconomic fluctuations. The
              | latter then showed how damaging a lack of such action could be and thus provided
              | the impetus for this sweeping reform.

blank         | 
text          | Why was the Fed’s structure reformed? As tempting as it is to say it stemmed
              | from Eccles’s work, this was not causal. He was simply exploiting an opportunity
              | created by the political context at the time. Partially as a result of the incomplete
              | reform passed in 1933, reform of the Fed’s structure remained on the political agenda
              | through 1934 and promised to be a focus of the 74th Congress. With the changes in
              | the partisan composition of government induced by the 1932 election, reform of the
              | nature that was passed became a profitable opportunity since it would raise utility
              | for much of the legislature.
              |    Still, had Glass’s veto power as the chairman of the relevant subcommittee in the
              | Senate not been eroded by changes in committee membership produced by further

              | vote in the upper chamber. Although Glass ultimately became an active member of
              | the “winning coalition,” it would be a mistake to view him as anything but opposed
              | this reform. He only chose to negotiate in good faith since he wanted to limit the
              | bill’s movement away from his ideal of a decentralized central bank.
              |    The final factor behind the bill’s success, and perhaps the most nuanced is the
              | learning of monetary policymakers and their Congressional observers in the interwar
              | period. Following World War I, many came to believe in the ability of open market
              | operations to reduce the downside associated with the cyclicality of economic produc-
              | tion. This trend only intensified as the Great Depression began. Had this learning
              | not occurred, the events of 1913 would likely have been repeated and decentralization
              | of the central bank continued. I can say this with confidence because, using the same
              | econometric method described in the previous section, I estimated whether Congress
              | could have passed the Banking Act of 1935 had the composition been identical to
              | what it was in 1913. The answer, displayed in Figure 2.14 in the Appendix, is a
              | resounding yes. Both houses have a predicted number of ‘yea’ votes well above the
              | required threshold to pass.

blank         | 
text          | Since the dawn of the 20th century, we have seen two major overhauls in the nature
              | of central banking in the United States. First, in response to the panic of 1907,
              | Congress set out to create the country’s third central bank. The legislation that
              | body ultimately passed, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, was the result of bargaining
              | between two divisions within the Democratic party that held divergent preferences

              | 
              | 
text          | over the central bank’s design. With more numbers and greater formal authority
              | as chairs, the side favoring a decentralizing institution won out and the institution
              | created mostly resembled their ideal structure.
              |    This changed, however, in 1935, when exogenous events induced changes in prefer-
              | ences and the side of the Democratic party in favor of making the Fed more centralized
              | and politicized became more powerful. This switch in the balance of power within
              | the party resulted in a corresponding change in the legislative outcome. Thus, the
              | Fed’s institutional design came to empower the wing of the Democratic party in fa-
              | vor of making monetary policy more in line with populists interests, a structure that
              | persists today. Had this not occurred, economic policy during the 20th century would
              | have been quite different. Liberal interests would have played a less salient role in
              | determining monetary policy and the potency of such policy would have been limited
              | by an inability to coordinate across Reserve districts, as was the case prior to the
              | structural reform produced via the 1935 legislation.
              |    So why have these changes not yet been undone or materially altered? The short
              | answer is that there just has not been an opportunity to change it again. Though
              | preferences evolved significantly during the early interwar period, following the bill’s
              | passage in 1935, they stayed fairly constant, particularly while Democrats retained
              | control of government during the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. When
              | Republicans eventually won it back in the 1952 elections, they only had it for a single
              | Congressional session and altering the structure of the Fed was not at the top of
              | their legislative agenda. Republicans did not have unified control again until 2003
              | and, by that point, the long boom following World War II had mitigated interest in
              | institutional reform of monetary policy. This is less true following the United States’s

text          | these longer-term economic objectives by pursuing a strategy that instead prioritizes
              | near-term growth since such a strategy may help achieve their political goals. In the
              | realm of monetary policy, this entails becoming more likely to cut interest rates (or
              | less likely to raise them) just before an election to provide a short-lived stimulus to
              | economic growth. By helping to improve perceptions of the incumbent president, this
              | approach to monetary policy may help the president (or his party) maintain control
              | of the White House. Subsequent work has debated the presence of what Nordhaus
              | (1975) refers to as the “political business cycle” in monetary policy, with evidence
              | pointing towards its presence prior to de jure and de facto reforms enacted during
              | Paul Volcker’s tenure as chairman of the Federal Reserve (1979–1987). Following
              | this period, though, the literature is more mixed and, as of now, no consensus exists
              | on the extent to which monetary policy is subject to political manipulation in the
              | contemporary (i.e., post-1980s) era.
              |    In this chapter, I fill that void by testing the presence and uniformity of an electoral
              | effect on monetary policy between 1989 and 2008. To do so, I hand-collect data on
              | monetary policy recommendations from the transcripts of the Federal Open Market
              | Committee (FOMC), the main policymaking body of the Federal Reserve. I then
              | employ a multifaceted coding strategy to determine the partisan identities of each
              | member serving on this committee during the twenty years of my sample. With these
              | data, I test whether FOMC officials issue different recommendations shortly prior to
              | elections than they do otherwise. These tests, which control for a variety of economic
              | covariates available at the time of the meeting as well as official Fed projects of future
              | economic performance, reveal a unique contribution.

text          | partisan preferences on monetary policy. Put differently, although partisan actors
              | are considered to desire the re-election of the incumbent president whenever the two
              | are of the same political party, those preferences are not always expressed. This
              | is because making a recommendation in the FOMC inconsistent with that of the
              | median – and then getting rolled – is costly. Therefore, I only expect monetary
              | policy recommendations to be explicitly made to help the president (or his party)
              | win re-election only when the member issuing that recommendation shares a party
              | affiliation with the president, the Board’s chair, and a majority of the committee.
              |    A pattern matching this hypothesis is then uncovered in the data. Statistical
              | tests reveal the extent of a strong, but not uniform electoral effect on monetary
              | policy. Specifically, I find that FOMC officials allow electoral interests to influence
              | their recommendations when their party affiliation is the same as the president, the
              | Board’s chair, and the median committee member. When these conditions hold for
              | a majority of the FOMC – as they did in 1992, 2004, and 2008 – the result is a clear
              | political business cycle in monetary policy. This effect is also apparent when compar-
              | ing meetings held during political scandals, as coded by Nyhan (2014), to otherwise
              | similar meetings held in politically calmer waters. These findings demonstrate how
              | political biases change the manner in which policy is made at a supposedly apoliti-
              | cal institution, ultimately leading to what all can agree are economically suboptimal
              | outcomes.
              |    This chapter proceeds as follows: in the second section, I introduce how monetary
              | policy is made at the Fed. I next review the literature debating the presence of a

text          | All national banks in the United States are required to be members of the Federal
              | Reserve System.2 These financial institutions are then assigned to one of twelve
              | regional Reserve banks, based on where they are headquartered (see Figure 3.1).3 As
              | a condition of membership, these institutions must deposit 3 percent of their capital
              | (i.e., the net worth of the bank, as calculated by subtracting its total liabilities from its
              | assets) in their respective regional Reserve bank. The twelve of these then pool their
              | resources and work together to provide value to their members banks – essentially
              | their shareholders – by maximizing aggregate financial and macroeconomic stability
              | in the US.4 This system is then overseen by a public body, the Board of Governors,
              | which is composed of seven political appointees, including one chairman.5
              |        To manage the system’s goals effectively, the Fed engages in three highly related
              | activities. The first of these – regulating financial institutions – is designed to ensure
              | that the system’s member banks are limiting their exposure to risk and are other-
              | wise operating safely. Without such regulation, banks would be less likely to avoid

              | course, even if banks are fundamentally sound, the fractional reserve system in bank-
              | ing in which a bank has far less cash-on-hand than deposits creates the possibility
              | of temporary cash constraints (e.g., the seminal scene from Frank Capra’s 1946 film,
              | It’s a Wonderful Life). To alleviate such issues of illiquidity, the Fed acts as a lender
              | of last resort, or the “bankers’s bank.” With the reserves it has collected from all its
              | member banks (more on this below), it can provide loans to banks facing short-term
              | cash shortages. Such action prevents needless and easily avoidable bank failures.
              |    The Fed’s last activity is to manage American monetary policy. Its objective in
              | this capacity is to facilitate the operation of a uniform currency in the US in a way
              | that smoothes macroeconomic fluctuations. The precise way to do so, though, is
              | not always universally accepted. This is because the Fed is statutorily obligated to
              | conduct monetary policy in a way that keeps both inflation and unemployment low,

              | discovered by Fisher (1926), prices tend to rise faster when unemployment is low and
              | slower when it is high. Put differently, when inflation is high, unemployment is low
              | and vice versa (this pattern is now referred to as the Phillips Curve; Figure 3.2).

text          |        Making this trade-off decision more difficult is that the Fed is not required to
              | prioritize one indicator over the other nor does it have to pursue specific targets in
              | outcomes. In other words, the FOMC is free to decide exactly how much inflation
              | is too much and what level of unemployment is too high.6 By not imposing strict
              | inflation and unemployment goals on itself, that body ultimately leaves this decision
              | up to each of its members, who independently decide how to handle this tradeoff. In

text          | be lowered (if inflation is more pressing), increased (if unemployment is the larger
              | concern), or maintained.
              |        To carry out this function (i.e., altering the supply of money in the economy), the
              | Fed has traditionally had three available tools at its disposal. First, it can change the
              | reserve ratio. That is, the Fed has the authority to alter the amount of funds a bank
              | keeps as either cash-on-hand (i.e., “vault cash”) or in deposits at the district Reserve
              | bank. Raising reserves will limit the amount of loans a bank can make, thereby
              | taming inflation but also reducing economic growth and employment levels, while
              | lowering reserve requirements has the opposite effect.7 However, since adjusting this
              | ratio – usually around 10% – has substantial consequences for a bank’s operational
              | budget and is a relatively coarse way to adjust the money supply, it is rarely changed.
              |        The second way in which the Fed conducts monetary policy is via the discount
              | rate. This is the interest rate the Fed charges to banks wishing to borrow from Reserve
              | banks.8 By directly providing cash to liquidity-constrained institutions, this tool has
              | the advantage of enabling the Fed to simultaneously serve as a lender of last resort
              | and adjust the money supply.9 For example, lowering the rate can simultaneously
              | ease liquidity concerns among member institutions and lower a bank’s cost of capital,
              | thereby promoting more lending and ultimately helping address concerns about weak
              | economic growth.10 While certainly an important part of the Fed’s toolkit, the dis-
              | count window has traditionally not served as the primary mechanism through which
meta          |    7
text          |      Since 2008, there has been a secondary dimension associated with this policy tool: the Reserve
              | banks are now able to pay (variable) interest on these deposits. This adoption has helped the Fed
              | keep the target and effective Fed Funds Rate close together.
meta          |    8
text          |      The riskiness of these loans is diminished by the fact that they are backed by collateral with a

meta          |    9
text          |      In response to the recent financial crisis, the Fed greatly expanded the scope of the discount
              | window by adding several new versions of it between 2007 and 2010. Chapter 4 focuses on this topic.

              |    That designation instead lies with the fed funds rate, which has been the Fed’s
              | preferred method of conducting monetary policy for many years. In fact, lending
              | through this mechanism has typically been ten times that of the discount window.
              | Moreover, the fed funds rate – what one financial institution charges another to bor-
              | row (overnight) its Reserve bank balances – is traditionally lower than the discount
              | rate since it eliminates the Fed’s role as a lending middleman. Despite these differ-
              | ences, policy decisions are motivated by the same reasoning: if inflation is too high,
              | the Fed will recommend raising interest rates, but will recommend lowering them if it
              | is unemployment that is too high. And, if neither is too high, then they will suggest
              | maintaining the fed funds rate at the current level. Put differently, the fed funds rate
              | is correlated with the state of the economy: decreases tend to occur during macroeco-
              | nomic contractions and raises during expansions. Or as former Fed chairman, William
              | McChesney Martin, liked to put it, monetary policy “leans against the wind” since
              | the overall supply is inversely related to the business cycle. Demonstrating this, as
              | the economy heated up in the early-to-mid 2000s, the fed funds rate increased to
              | keep prices stable and interest rates moderate; it then fell drastically as the economy
              | entered the “Great Recession” and unemployment rose dramatically.
              |    Importantly, the Fed does not possess direct control over the fed fund rates, unlike
              | its two other monetary policy mechanisms. Instead, it sets a target rate and then
              | directs a group of traders (managing the “System Open Market Account”) at the
              | Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct open market operations – the buying
              | and selling of US Treasury securities – to hit this target. If it wants the fed funds rate
              | to fall, these traders will buy securities from “primary dealers,” which then deposit

text          | the proceeds from these sales in the Fed’s member banks, ultimately expanding the
              | latter group’s reserves. From here, basic economic principles take over: with more
              | reserves (supply) in the system, the fed funds rate (prices) fall. The opposite is also
              | true: the Fed can increase the fed funds rate (prices) by selling securities since that
              | will lower the amount of reserves (supply) in the system.
              |     This last monetary policy mechanism is also set apart by being the only one of the
              | three in which policy decisions are jointly made by the Reserve banks and the Board
              | of Governors. The latter has exclusive control over setting reserve requirements and
              | final say over the discount rate.11 In the case of the fed funds rate, though, policy
              | is made in the FOMC, which includes officials from both groups. All seven political
              | appointees serving on the Board of Governors are included on the FOMC. The body’s
              | other five members come from the presidents of the twelve Reserve banks.12 The
              | president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is always among these five (it
              | has a permanent seat on the FOMC), while the other 11 presidents rotate into the
              | committee every other or every third year.13
              |     Given these inherent constituency-level differences, it is unsurprising that several
              | scholars have found a link between officials’ “type” and the recommendations that

              | dents (or bankers) appoint individuals who will evaluate the tradeoff between unem-
              | ployment and inflation in a manner similar to themselves (Chang 2003, p. 140). For
              | Democratic presidents, who depend on voters, such as from laborers and borrowers,
              | with a clear preference for higher inflation and lower unemployment,14 that means
              | appointing those who are relatively more likely to suggest reducing interest rates.
              | Conversely, Republican presidents are answering to business groups, high-earners,
              | and savers who prefer a more balanced approach and a modest rate of inflation.15
              | This leads to a greater likelihood of supporting interest rate increases. However, the
              | group most likely to do so is the Reserve bank presidents who are answering directly to
              | bankers, whose profitability is generally maximized under conditions of low inflation.
              |        Evidence for this pattern comes from several sources. Samuelson (1977) shows
              | that Democrats tend to have a higher inflation tolerance than Republicans (p. 30–31).

              | in terms of which issue they emphasize as needing improvement – unemployment and
              | inflation – and generally enact policies to address these concerns. Similarly, Hibbs
              | (1987) finds that Democratic voters tend to evaluate incumbent politicians based
              | more on unemployment than inflation, while the opposite is true for Republicans
              | (p. 177). Finally, Chappell, Havrilesky, and McGregor (1993), McGregor (1996),

text          |       This preference is highly rational since, as Wolff (1979) reported, “inflation [can act] like a
              | progressive tax, leading to a greater equality in the distribution of wealth” (p. 207). Moreover,
              | as Minarik (1980) points out, “many if not most low-income households are protected [from price
              | increases] by explicit or implicit indexing of their incomes”; as a result, they suffer relatively little
              | from inflation, but may gain significantly from increased employment opportunities (p. 226–227).
              | Similarly, cost of living adjustments help prevent social security recipients’ incomes from being
              | adversely affected by inflation (ibid, p. 229).

text          | Most studies assessing the presence of a political business cycle in monetary policy
              | have decided against pursuing this more fine-grained, individual-level analysis and
              | focused instead on observable outcomes. For many years, this choice was inconse-
              | quential since the evidence in favor of a political business cycle at the Fed was so
              | strong. That is, many came to agree with Nordhaus’s (1975) claim that partisan
              | actors want their party to maintain control of the White House and those working at
              | the Fed are just as likely to use policy to try to attain this objective as their counter-
              | parts in other bureaucratic agencies. In the same sense, few contested Tufte’s (1978)
              | assertion that the Fed acted to facilitate the president’s (or his party’s) re-election
              | chances. Highlighting this, it was widely believed that President Nixon had strong-

              | not interfere in any way with its decisions.16 When Carter agreed, Volcker accepted
              | the job. Under his watch, the Fed quickly increased interest rates, which initiated a
              | painful recession, but finally ended stagflation. This economic situation contributed
              | to a swift defeat for Carter in the 1980 election, though “to his credit, President
              | Carter honored his pledge not to pressure Volcker” (Meltzer 2010b, p. 1011).
              |        In addition to allowing Volcker to operate free of political inference (i.e., increase
              | the Fed’s de facto independence), President Carter also signed two bills into that law
              | that were designed to raise the Fed’s de jure independence by mandating that mon-
              | etary policy follow clear long-term objectives. The Federal Reserve Reform Act of
              | 1977 made price stability the Fed’s primary objective for the first time, while the Full
              | Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 introduced the aforementioned dual-
              | mandate for the Fed of low inflation (i.e., stable prices) and maximum employment.
              | Put together, these changes were seen as being a strong move towards full political
              | independence for the Fed. As Waller (2011) puts it, “the Federal Reserve System
              | is a well-designed institution, created by Congress, that keeps the government from
              | relying on the printing press to finance public spending. It is independent, credible,

              | business cycle in interest rates and monetary aggregates before the 1972 election, but
              | no evidence thereafter. Abrams and Iossifov (2006) produce corroborating evidence.
              | Following an analysis of monetary policy between 1957 and 2004, they argue that the
              | Fed becomes more expansionary in the 7 quarters preceding an election, but acknowl-
              | edge that this effect basically disappears during the Greenspan era (p. 257).17 In a
              | follow-up study using the same data, Tempelman (2007) agrees with this, displaying
              | null results when removing pre-Volcker data from the sample. Faust and Irons (1999)
              | are also skeptical of the persistence of such an effect.
              |    Still, there are those that insist a political business cycle in monetary policy re-
              | mains. Clark and Arel-Bundock (2013) contend that this effect is uniform in the
              | entire sample between 1954 and 2008, though only under Republican administra-
              | tions. That is, they suggest “the Federal Funds Rate declines as elections approach
              | when Republicans control the White House, but rises before elections when the sitting
              | President is a Democrat” (p. 1). Hellerstein (2007) reaches a different conclusion,
              | suggesting that the Fed embraces inaction around elections and neglects to raise in-
              | terest rates even when it should. Thus, the central bank is providing a short-lived
              | implicit stimulus to the economy. This builds on earlier work done by Beck (1991)
              | and Drazen (2001) pointing to a political business cycle generated by active fiscal
              | policy and accommodated by passive monetary policy.
              |    While these outcome-based analyses have yielded relatively weak evidence in sup-
              | port of a political business cycle in monetary policy, two recent studies have taken a
              | different approach by accounting for individual-level variation (Chappell et al. 2005;

text          | Adolph 2013). This is a preferable approach for understanding how elections affect
              | monetary policy since using the fed funds rate as the dependent variable is question-
              | able, as “the FOMC cannot totally control the federal funds rate” (Chang 2003, p.
              | 87). Interestingly, both studies present stronger results. In other words, they argue
              | that “in-party” governors (what I call copartisans) on the FOMC are generally more
              | “dovish” (i.e., likely to recommend easing interest rates) and become even more so
              | around elections.
              |        However, several factors lead us to question the validity of these findings. First,
              | they assume any electoral effect is uniform across parties. If Clark and Arel-Bundock
              | (2013) are correct in asserting that the Fed only reacts to electoral pressure under
              | Republican administrations, then their broad conclusion may be an overgeneraliza-
              | tion. This could also be true if Abrams and Iossifov (2006) are right in their claim
              | that there is only an effect when the president and the chair are members of the same
              | party since Chappell et al. (2005) and Adolph (2013) do not account for the role
              | of the party identification chair and the median FOMC member. In addition, these
              | analyses assume the Reserve bank presidents are not partisan actors and therefore
              | treated as a monolithic block. This misses a point raised by Tootell (1996): members
              | of this group can be distinguished from one another on the basis of their partisan
              | background.18 Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the data analyses in both
              | Chappell et al. (2005) and Adolph (2013) rely heavily on data from the pre-Volcker
              | era. Thus, their conclusion that there is an electoral effect on copartisans’ monetary

text          |     While innovative, Tootell (1996) uses a very coarse measure of partisan backgrounds by simply

text          | To derive an original testable hypothesis regarding how elections affect monetary
              | policy recommendations, I build off of a robust literature on economic voting that
              | considers voters to be retrospective and economically minded when evaluating the
              | president (Cohen and Noll 1991; Duch and Stevenson 2006; Fiorina 1978; Lewis-Beck
              | and Paldam 2000). Moreover, following recent developments in this literature, I
              | assume the incumbent president or his party are primarily evaluated on the basis of
              | economic performance immediately preceding an election (< 12 months), rather than
              | the full duration of his term (Achen and Bartels 2004).19
meta          |   19
text          |      This assumption treats voters as not fully rational; if they were, then they would evaluate
              | the president based on the economic performance “over [his] entire term of office, with little or no
              | backward time discounting” (Hibbs 2004, p. 7). However, as Achen and Bartels (2004) report,
              | “the clear consensus in the literature is that recent economic performance is much more relevant
              | at election time than what happened earlier” (p. 16). Uchitelle (2004) uses blunter language: “If
              | the economy is flourishing in the final weeks of a campaign, when the music stops, the incumbent is
              | likely to be re-elected.” Experimental studies have illustrated the psychological micro-foundations
              | behind this phenomenon. Huber, Hill, and Lenz (2012) show that participants tasked with evaluating
              | randomized computer “allocators” place significantly more weight on the payments most recently
              | received. This short-term bias leads them to not choose allocators that offer greater total payments,
              | but rather those with payments peaking at the end of the cycle. Similarly, Healy and Lenz (2014) use
              | a set of survey experiments to demonstrate that voters choose to rely on recent outcome measures
              | instead of evenly weighting those from the full time horizon since the former are seen as easier to
              | rely upon.

text          |        This myopia among voters provides an opportunity for the Fed to use monetary
              | policy to provide a short-term boost to the economy.20 The intuition here is straight-
              | forward: by lowering the fed funds rate, the Fed can increase the supply of money
              | and credit in the economy, which together work to stimulate economic production
              | and employment. To voters focusing on the short-term, these improvements signal
              | that the incumbent president is succeeding in managing the economy and therefore
              | make them more likely to support his re-election campaign or, if he is term-limited,
              | that of his party.
              |        Not surprisingly, however, a stimulative approach to monetary policy when not
              | justified by economic expectations at the time is not costless. In a macroeconomic
              | sense, lowering interest rates when economic observables do not support doing so
              | (e.g., with modest levels of unemployment) – or failing to raise them when rising
              | inflation concerns suggest raising them – will produce higher-than-desired inflation in
              | the long-run. There are also implications for institutional legitimacy: a central bank
              | perceived to be helping the incumbent win elections will be less able to achieve its
              | long-run objectives of full employment and stable prices. As Richard Fisher (2010),
              | the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, stated, a country cannot achieve
              | “sustainable non-inflationary growth if its central bank is governed by a politicized
              | monetary authority.” This long-term cost to the central bank of pursuing electoral
              | goals presents monetary policymakers with a clear trade-off: should they help the
              | incumbent president and sacrifice its long-term goals or stay the course on monetary

              |        Not surprisingly, not all officials serving on the FOMC handle this calculation in
              | the same way. We know this because the structure of the institution makes hetero-
              | geneity in partisan background almost inevitable. As introduced above, seven of the
              | twelve on the committee (the Governors) are politically appointed and therefore have
              | a clear party affiliation. With fourteen-year terms, these appointments (by design)
              | do not overlap neatly with a president’s term and, in absence of one party control-
              | ling the White House (and appointments to the Fed) for an extended period, both
              | parties will have representation on the Board of Governors. The five Reserve bank
              | presidents serving on the FOMC present another potential source of partisan hetero-
              | geneity. Although they are not formally selected by the president, there is no reason
              | to expect them to lack a partisan identity altogether.21 Thus, although we may not
              | easily observe their political party affiliations, we still must account for them since
              | their susceptibility to partisan bias around elections depends on this factor.
              |        Obviously, some in this group will be unaffiliated with either party, just as many
              | members of the general public are. There is little reason to expect those individuals
              | to try to help the incumbent. After all, we cannot expect someone to be willing
              | to accept a substantial long-term cost to help a politician to which he is (at least
              | publicly) indifferent. Put differently, for these political independents, the costs of
              | manipulating the money supply around elections is simply not offset by a sufficient
              | benefit.
              |        In the same way, the Reserve bank presidents and Governors with ties to the op-
              | posite party of the president are not expected to try to help the incumbent. In fact,

text          | for this group of officials, there may even be an incentive to instead pursue restric-
              | tive monetary policy since raising interest rates will have the opposite effect on the
              | economy in the short-term: reducing production and employment, both of which hurt
              | the incumbent. However, the benefits of this “contrarian” policy may not always ex-
              | ceed the expected costs. If such an approach to monetary policy is implemented, but
              | unsuccessful, thereby allowing the opposite party to maintain control of the White
              | House, the Fed may be subject to political attacks, such as audits and other attempts
              | to decrease its cherished autonomy. This may also be true if officials at the Fed are
              | subject to loss aversion. That is, if monetary policymakers prefer avoiding losses to
              | acquiring gains, they will be likely to help an incumbent president of the same party,
              | but unlikely to try to hurt one of an opposite party (Kahneman and Tversky 1979).
              | That monetary policy is not guaranteed to sway election outcomes (i.e., there is in-
              | herent uncertainty in this relationship) increases the likelihood of these policymakers
              | being loss averse. For these two reasons, I am reluctant to put forth a strong theo-
              | retical expectation on whether elections in which the incumbent president is of the
              | opposite party will result in these out-of-power monetary policymakers exhibiting no

              |    There is much less theoretical ambiguity, however, for those sharing a partisan

              | to change their monetary policy recommendations around elections. Like partisan
              | actors everywhere, they have an unambiguous preference for a fellow member of their
              | party to control the White House (Nordhaus 1975). Thus, as long as the expected

              | at the Fed to be prone to advocating “policies with immediate, highly visible benefits
              | and deferred, hidden costs – myopic policies for myopic voters” (Tufte 1978, p. 143).22
              |        Still, there is one reason why copartisans of the president would not make mon-
              | etary policy recommendations designed to help the incumbent president. Central
              | bankers will not want to develop a reputation as an overt political agent of the pres-
              | ident if that personal cost is not sufficiently offset by a tangible benefit. In this
              | context, that means they should not be expected to recommend unjustified increases
              | in the money supply around elections unless they can be confident that enough fellow
              | members of the FOMC will also do so. That is, unless at least half of the FOMC
              | voting members share the party identification of the president, any attempts to use
              | monetary policy to sway the presidential election will be unable to generate the de-
              | sired policy outcome. Since such attempts will still produce reputational costs, but
              | without yielding compensatory benefits, policymakers will avoid them as long as they
              | are not expected to succeed.
              |        In a similar way, changing the course of monetary policy around elections likely

              |        More generally, though, it could just be the case that the chair is being strategic
              | and advocating the median’s policy recommendation to ensure that he is not rolled

              | a separate study, for now we can say that having the support of both the median and

text          | To measure the preferences expressed by Fed officials, I take a comprehensive ap-
              | proach. First, using the FOMC’s official minutes, released three weeks after the
              | meeting and published on the Fed’s website, I document each member of the FOMC’s
              | vote. These minutes indicate the direction of the policy change – maintain, lower, or
              | raise – and whether each member voted in support of the change. In the case of a
              | dissent, the minutes describe the member’s preferred alternative (maintain, lower, or
              | raise). Thus, determining the direction of a policymaker’s vote from the minutes is
              | fairly straight-forward.
              |        My data set begins with 1989 since, prior to that, the Fed had relied on a mone-
              | tarist approach to monetary policy in which it targeted the money supply and bor-
              | rowed reserves instead of the fed funds rate (Meade 2005). Shortly after the start of
              | the Greenspan era, the FOMC began targeting the fed funds rate and this continued
              | until December of 2008, when the fed funds rate had reached zero, prompting the Fed

              | isons about the determinants of monetary policy recommendations for these twenty
              | years is most reasonable; expanding the data set into more years could produce com-
              | parisons of “apples-and-oranges.” Incorporating more recent data, even if desirable,
              | is not possible, though, since the Fed only releases the transcripts after a lag of five
              | years. The 2009 meetings will not be released until January of 2015.
              |       Overall, the minutes from the 165 meetings held in these 20 years give us 1,790
              | observations (∼12 officials/meeting ∗ ∼8 meetings/year * 20 years = 1,790 observa-
              | tions). Of these, 338 (18.88%) represented a recommendation for lowering the fed
              | funds rate, while 368 (20.56%) were for increasing the rate. The other 1,084 (60.55%)
              | were in favor of keeping it constant (for a summary, see the right half of Figure 3.3).
              |       In addition to the votes, I examine the verbal recommendations, as provided by
              | the official FOMC transcripts. In this pursuit, I follow Meade (2005), who uses the
              | transcripts of the 72 FOMC meetings from 1989 to 1997 to describe each member’s
              | verbal recommendation for the change to the fed funds rate (in basis points) and
              | how that compares to both the chair’s initial recommendation and their ultimate
              | vote. With a similar set of explicit coding rules, my research assistant and I then
              | hand-collected data from the 93 FOMC meetings held between 1989 to 2008. In total,
              | these transcripts offer 2,920 observations (16–19 officials/meeting ∗ ∼8 meetings/year
              | * 20 years = 2,920 observations).
              |       By providing recommendations made in basis points instead of directional arrows
              | (as the votes do), these data offer a more precise estimate of the recommendations
              | made by the FOMC participants. In addition, these may better reflect the internal

              | gression. However, my data are not continuous. Rather, the recommendations are
              | made in increments of 25 basis points. If these recommendations were instead made
              | a true continuum, we could rely on the OLS technique. Since they clearly are not,
              | though, estimates derived from OLS may be unreliable (Williams 2006).
              |        To deal with this lack of continuity, we could instead treat each distinct recom-
              | mendation as one unit in an eight-point scale. That is, divide each recommendation
              | by 25, and then code it as a value on a simple ordinal scale, ranging from -3 to +4.29
              | With this set of ordinal outcomes, one could potentially use an ordered logistic re-
              | gression or an ordered probit. For us to be sure that this is the right model, we need
              | to check that the assumptions inherent in it are met in this instance. Specifically, we
              | need to check that the relationship between each pair of outcome groups is identical.
              | This is because this particular model constrains the coefficients for each independent
              | variable to be the same, regardless of whether it is comparing the lowest possible
              | outcome (-3) to all higher ones (-2 through +4), or the second lowest (-2) to the ones
              | above it (-1 through +4). Fortunately, this assumption, known as the proportional
              | odds or the parallel lines assumption, is testable. To address this question, I run a
              | Wald test. If the proportional odds assumption is upheld in the data, then the test
              | statistic in the Wald test will be insignificant. In my case, it is not. The χ2 value on
              | 15 degrees of freedom is 189.16, which corresponds to a p-value of 0.00. This is not
              | particularly surprising, though, since I am asking a lot out of relatively sparse data,
              | particularly in the tails. In other words, the variation in the independent variables

              |        To help address this issue, then, I collapse the recommendations into a trichotomy
              | of lower (-1), maintain (0), or raise (+1) interest rates. Though this partially helps
              | address the previous problem, a subsequent Wald test also fails (χ2 = 24.00 and
              | p = 0.03). A second test of this assumption, the Brant Test of Parallel Regression
              | Assumption, confirms that the assumption is violated. As a result, we have to pursue
              | an alternative econometric model that does not require all the coefficients to be
              | fixed.30
              |        One way to do this would be the multinomial logit. Just as before, we must
              | ensure that this model’s assumptions are met. In this instance, the main assumption
              | is the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). For this assumption to hold in
              | the context of explaining monetary policy recommendations, if an official on the
              | FOMC is indifferent between an increase and a decrease (i.e., 50% chance of choosing
              | either), then they would have to maintain that probability ratio if a third alternative
              | – maintaining interest rates – is available. Although there are suggested ways to test
              | this assumption, such as the Hausman-McFadden test (1984) and the Small-Hsiao
              | test (1985), simulations performed by Fry and Harris (1996, 1998) and Cheng and
              | Long (2006) demonstrate their unreliability. As a result, we must use theory to
              | instead guide our judgement on this issue and, in that sense, we cannot reasonably
              | conclude that the addition of an alternative monetary policy would not change the
              | recommendations ultimately issued. Since this model’s ignorance of the ordinal nature

              | alternative approaches.

text          |    The one we ultimately come to rely on is the generalized ordered logit. This is
              | almost identical to the more commonly used generalized ordered logit model, but it
              | relaxes the proportional odds or the parallel lines assumption where necessary. In
              | other words, it imposes partial proportional odds by allowing the coefficients to differ
              | if (and only if) they do not pass a Wald test of parallel lines. It does so by running a
              | series of binary logistic regressions. So, with three possible outcomes (-1, 0, and +1),

              | tion as well as other sources on governors’ partisan identities from McGregor (1996)
              | and Nixon (2005).
              |        Not surprisingly, establishing the partisan identities for the non-appointed Reserve
              | bank presidents is more of a challenge. To my knowledge, there have been no system-
              | atic attempts at establishing their identities, or at least none that generated a public
              | database of this information. For the most part, these officials’ partisan identities are
              | also not disclosed in the press or in the announcements concerning their selection.
              | There are a few, though, for whom this is not the case. For example, Richard W.
              | Fisher, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, ran as the Democratic
              | party’s choice for one of Texas’ US Senate seats. Likewise, William Poole became the
              | President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis immediately after serving at the
              | White House in the Reagan Administration as a member of the Council of Economic
              | Advisors. For such individuals – three Republicans and this one Democrat – we can
              | reasonably treat them as members of one party or the other.
              |        To establish the party memberships for other officials (i.e., those lacking a clear
              | connection to one party, as indicated by their curriculum vitae or press reports), I
              | examine other sources. First, I search for any voter registration information pertaining
              | to the officials. To do so, I rely on a national voter file published by Catalist, a political
              | data provider.33 These registration data indicate that four are Democrats, another
              | four are Independents, and five are Republicans. The remaining 15 are not able to be
              | identified, since they either are (or were) not a registered voter or are not included in
              | the Catalist voter file that I have access to through my university’s subscription.34

text          |        As a supplementary source, I follow Bonica et. al (2012) by deriving these individ-
              | uals’ ideal points from their campaign contributions. Specifically, using the Database
              | on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections (Bonica 2013), I collected data on
              | each monetary policymakers’ campaign contributions between 1979 and 2012. This
              | included when, how much, and to whom they gave. With these data and the method-
              | ology established by Bonica (2014), I then derived an estimate of their ideology known
              | as their CFscore. This is a numerical, unidimensional estimate of how liberal or con-
              | servative each official is based on which candidates and group they donate to. Giving
              | exclusively to liberal Democrats will generate a score far below zero, while donating
              | to conservative Republicans will lead to a highly positive CFscore.
              |        To determine if they can be treated as a Democrat or Republican, I compare their
              | CFscores to the universe of political candidates in state and federal elections. If their
              | CFscore is closer to the median of Democratic politicians (-0.691) than it is to zero
              | (the score of one who is perfectly independent), I code the official as a Democrat.
              | Likewise, if their scores are greater than 0.425, (i.e., half of the median score of
              | the Republican candidates of 0.850), then I code them as a Republican. For those
              | without any campaign contributions or a CFscore closer to zero, I code them as having
              | no party identification.35 This exercise offers evidence that five of the presidents are
              | Democrats and 10 Republicans, while the other 21 are either considered independents
              | or unable to be classified (see also Figure 3.4 in the Appendix).
              |        I then put these data together and look for inconsistencies. In other words, if one
              | data source indicates the Fed official is of another party, but another source shows

              | Jeffrey Lacker, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, since they were both
              | made to the Human Rights Campaign National Marriage Fund. These two donations are the only
              | indication of his political identity, so I am unwilling to declare him to be a member of either party.

text          | them to not be in this category, then I code them as having no party affiliation. For
              | example, Edward Gerald Corrigan, a former President of the Federal Reserve Bank
              | of New York, had, at one point, registered to vote as a member of the Democratic
              | party, but has given substantial campaign donations to politicians in both parties.
              | As a result, I code him as having no partisan affiliation and therefore never being
              | a copartisan of the president.36 Overall, this coding strategy produces the following
              | results: five are Democrats and twelve are Republicans, while nineteen cannot be
              | safely classified as being in either party.
              |        Following much of the previous literature on the existence of a political business
              | cycle in monetary policy, I use a simple binary variable to code each meeting as either
              | being a one or a zero, based on whether it is within twelve months of a presidential
              | election. This cutoff point makes the most sense since this is when the potency of a
              | monetary boost to the economy is maximized, particularly given what we know about
              | how voters retrospectively evaluate the incumbent president (or his party). Using a
              | different window may produce a Type II error by finding no effect. Cutting interest
              | rates (or not deciding against raising them) in meetings held over a year away will lead
              | to economic growth well before the election, but is also likely to produce increases in
              | inflation before that event. Thus, the benefits of manipulating the money supply so
              | far in advance are limited. Likewise, if the window was smaller, say six months, the
              | benefits would be less likely to be fully realized prior to the election, thereby limiting
              | the incentives to change recommendations just prior to the election.
              |        As a robustness check, I also look to see if monetary policymakers change their
              | recommendations in other politically salient meetings. Specifically, I look to see if

text          |    Similarly, Richard Francis Syron, who served in the Treasury Department during the Carter
              | administration, was also a frequent donor to candidates on both sides of the aisle, so I do not code
              | him as a Democrat.

text          | recommendations are altered during political scandals affecting the president. This
              | measure comes from Nyhan (2014), who classifies 28 scandals based on extensive
              | coverage by The Washington Post between 1978 and 2008.37 A meeting is coded as
              | a one if there is at least one front-page story in the The Washington Post about a
              | political scandal affecting the president during the week of the FOMC meeting and a
              | zero otherwise. The intuition here is that if monetary policymakers are trying to help
              | their party keep control of the White House, they may also be willing to help their
              | copartisan when his political capital has been partially eroded by a scandal. On the
              | other hand, if Fed officials are not influenced by political concerns, then they should
              | issue the same types of recommendations during scandals as they do otherwise.
              |       Of course, to fully account for the determinants of each FOMC participants’ mon-
              | etary policy recommendations, we must account for relevant economic variables. Af-
              | ter all, Fed officials should be acting in line with the Fed’s guiding legislation, the
              | Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, which mandates that the Fed
              | “promote full employment and production, increased real income, balanced growth,
              | a balanced Federal budget, adequate productivity growth, proper attention to na-
              | tional priorities, achievement of an improved trade balance ... and reasonable price
              | stability.” To most appropriately model the decisions of the FOMC officials, I rely
              | heavily on the Fed’s Greenbook forecasts, the internal set of economic reporting and
              | forecasting that monetary policymakers have access to at the time of their decisions.
              | The importance of using these real-time data instead of ex post revised data is well
              | documented by Orphanides (2001).
              |       The bulk of the data from the Greenbook that I use measure the Fed’s projec-
              | tions for real, quarter-over-quarter growth in the following areas: real GDP (Real

              | expenditures (Consumption), real business fixed investment (Business Investment),
              | and federal government consumption and gross investment (Federal Expenditures).
              | I also employ projections from the Greenbook regarding the overall unemployment
              | rate (Unemployment), the number of housing starts in millions (Housing Starts), and
              | quarterly growth in the industrial production index (Production). All of these mea-
              | sures were the most recent projections available to the policymakers as of the FOMC
              | meeting.
              |    To this data set, I also add a trade-weighted measure of the US dollar (Dollar
              | Value Change), obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’ FRED economic
              | database, as well as a measure of the S&P 500 (S&P Change). In both instances,
              | these were measured on the percentage change in value over the last 90-days, as
              | measured on the day before the FOMC meeting, an approach consistent with both
              | the dependent variable and other independent variables. Finally, I add a control for
              | the current US government operating budget (Budget Deficit), also accessed via the
              | Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’ FRED economic database, and the fed funds
              | rate at the time of the meeting (Prior FFR). To ensure that all of these controls
              | were useful additions to the econometric model, I ran several tests of collinearity. By
              | finding the variance-inflation factors to be at acceptable levels, these tests confirmed
              | that none of the control variables is a linear function of others.

text          | made in non-election meetings. As an illustrative first step, I use a 1-sample propor-
              | tions test to derive a confidence interval around a mean representing the probability
              | of recommending a reduction of the fed funds rate.38 As a follow up, I employ Tukey’s
              | Honest Significance Test to generate a set of confidence intervals on the within-party
              | differences of the mean of recommending a rate cut based solely on the type of election
              | upcoming: none, Republican, or Democratic. The results from these two exercises,
              | displayed in Tables 3.1 and 3.2, suggest that, on average, Republicans were most
              | likely to recommend a rate cut during meetings held within 12 months of an election
              | in which the incumbent was also a Republican.39 This group of Republican mone-
              | tary policymakers also appears slightly less likely to be in favor of reducing the fed
              | funds rate during a Democratic presidential election year than they are otherwise.
              | However, the difference between the mean likelihood in the no election group and the
              | Democratic election group is not statistically significant (see the bottom row of the
              | left side of Table 3.2).
              |        Among the Democratic monetary policymakers, the distinctions are more modest.
              | These analyses offer no evidence that there is a difference between the likelihood of a
              | rate cut recommendation around elections with a Republican incumbent and one with
              | no election upcoming. However, the Tukey’s Honest Significance Test suggests that
              | Democrats on the FOMC are significantly less likely to recommend a reduction in the
meta          |   38
text          |      The results from this exercise – though not displayed – would be similar, but flipped if the
              | dependent variable was instead measured as the probability of recommending an increase in the fed
              | funds rate. Note also that this test is run without a continuity correction since doing so would lead
              | to an overcorrection raising the probability of a Type II error (Stefanescu, Berger and Hershberger
              | 2005).
meta          |   39
text          |      For added robustness, I also ran a Welch Two Sample t-test comparing Republicans’ proclivities
              | for recommending a rate cut in meetings held around Republican elections to a baseline of meetings
              | with no election proximate. This difference between the two is, again, highly statistically significant
              | (t statistic = -3.147 on 263 degrees of freedom; p-value = 0.002). Moreover, an ANOVA F-Test
              | suggests that we can reject the null hypothesis that all three groups have identical means (p <

              | implications since, as with all of the results from these univariate exercises, they

              | retically enable us to analyze a wider range of the dependent variable (i.e., an ordinal
              | scale from -3 to +4), the tails on both ends are simply too thin to run a successful
              | test. Thus, we must rely instead on the trichotomous measure introduced in Subsec-
              | tion 3.4.1, where the dependent variable is coded as -1 if the policymaker advocates
              | a reduction in the fed funds rate, 0 if she prefers the status quo, and +1 if she would
              | prefer to raise the rate.
              |        Table 3.3 displays the results for the coefficients of interest. Among Republican
              | monetary policymakers, there is a statistically significant and negative effect around
              | elections in which the incumbent president is a Republican. More specifically, the
              | coefficient of interest is estimated to have a value of -1.882, with a p-value less than
              | 0.001. Thus, we can safely reject the null hypothesis that elections with a Republican
              | incumbent have no effect on Republican monetary policymakers. Rather, it appears
              | that Republican monetary policymakers have a clear pattern of lowering their interest
              | rate recommendations around Republican elections.40 The same cannot be said, how-
              | ever, for Republicans around Democratic elections or Democrats around any election.

              | this rises to 39.1% if a Republican (or his party) is up for re-election within twelve
              | months. Reflecting the potency of this effect, the upper bound of the probability of a
              | Republican advocating for an increase in a non-election meeting is 20.6%, lower than
              | the lower bound of the probability of doing so during a meeting around a Republican
              | election. Although Republicans appear to be slightly less likely to recommend a rate
              | cut around Democratic re-election campaigns (15.8% vs. 16.7%), this difference is
              | not statistically significant.42 For the Democrats, all three point estimates are within
              | 320 basis points of one another, consistent with the lack of statistical significance in
              | the coefficients produced by the generalized ordered logits.
              |     To add further confidence that the results presented here are not being driven
              | by some unobserved variable, I run an additional regression for Republicans that

              | monetary policy judgements. As a result, this specification of the regression reduces

              | recommended changes to the fed funds rate is again negative and statistically signif-
              | icant. In fact, the magnitude of the coefficient (-2.275) is larger than without person
              | fixed effects (-1.882; see Table 3.11 for the full regression report). As before, the

              | groups of Republicans are to recommend lowering interest rates around Republican
              | elections – or less likely to recommend a rate increase (see Table 3.6). Although the

              | bank presidents also exhibit different (i.e., more accommodative) behavior around

              | the president merely because of their personal attachments to that politician or their

              | icy to try to keep one’s party in control of the White House is likely to induce benefits
              | that exceed costs (at least in the short-term), in the inverse scenario – tightening the
              | supply of money to hurt a president of the opposite party – the costs will likely be
              | greater than the benefits. This is because implementing an exceptionally restrictive
              | course of monetary policy could jeopardize the Fed’s cherished autonomy. Raising
              | interest rates when not called for based on economic fundamentals would not only be
              | particularly unpopular with the president of the opposite party, but also the general
              | public. Put together, these two phenomena could lead to the Fed becoming more con-
              | strained in the future than it otherwise would be, a highly undesirable outcome for
              | monetary policymakers. This null finding among Republican central bankers during
              | Democratic election years could also be explained by these officials engaging in loss
              | aversion. This would mean that they prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. Either
              | (or both) can explain Republican monetary policymakers’ pattern of being willing to
              | help a copartisan but no such pattern when it comes to hurting a non-copartisan.
              |    Still, it is worth acknowledging that a small, but real negative effect may be
              | present. With a limited sample size, it is possible, though unlikely, that we could
              | possibly be making a Type II error by finding no effect when there is in fact one.

              | that under the current sample size of 1,218, the probability of concluding an effect is
              | present given that there actually is one is less than 5%, once controls are included.

              | would only rise to just over 10%.
              |        The lack of a demonstrable effect among Democrats is also unsurprising. This is
              | not because this group of monetary policymakers is inherently more benevolent (or
              | less Machiavellian) than their Republican counterparts. Rather, they simply never
              | had a chance to, as a group, dictate the course of monetary policy around elections.

              | appointed by Republican presidents and their membership in the Republican party

              | could have been used to help the Democrats keep control of the White House (8 in
              | 1996 and another 8 in 2000), there were never more than four Democratic members
              | on the FOMC. In fact, not only did the Democrats not have a majority in these

              |        The exact opposite is true, however, for the meetings held around presidential

              | Thus, they had no real ability to prevent (or veto) the Republicans from changing

              | The Washington Post, durations often exceed one week. So, although there were only five political
              | scandals during the George H.W. Bush administration, fourteen of the meetings held during his four
              | years a president are coded as having taken place during a political scandal. In the same way, the
              | five political scandals of the George W. Bush administration spanned thirteen FOMC meetings.

title         | 3.6      Conclusion
blank         | 
text          | In this chapter, I have presented clear empirical evidence that partisan actors at the
              | Federal Reserve are willing to sacrifice their long-run macroeconomic objectives to
              | achieve political gains. However, I also show how their willingness to do so is con-
              | ditional on the partisan composition of the institution in which they are operating.
              | Since expressing electorally influenced recommendations while in the (partisan) mi-
              | nority is costly, monetary policymakers are only willing to do so when their party
              | is in control of the committee. This explains why we only observe Republicans act-
              | ing as partisan actors: in each of the three elections in which the incumbent was a
              | Republican, the FOMC had a Republican chair and more than 50% of its members

              | during Democratic election years, making the null effect for that group of monetary
              | policymakers unsurprising.
              |    More broadly, these findings offer further evidence of how partisan interests can
              | influence the making of public policy in the bureaucracy. For any governmental
              | agency with policy discretion – many fit this bill, especially the Fed – there may be
              | an opportunity to use policy to accomplish partisan electoral goals. Nevertheless,
              | such “political policy cycles” are often counter to long-term objectives so there are
              | many that may be interested in reducing or eliminating these patterns, particularly
              | via an adjustment to the institutional design. In general, expanding the number of
              | veto points or preventing the ability of one set of partisan actors from controlling
              | these veto points may help.
              |    One particular idea comes to mind from the legislative history of the Fed. During
              | the congressional debate over the Banking Act of 1935, Senator Carter Glass (D–VA)
              | inserted a provision into the bill that would have restricted membership on the FOMC
              | to no more than four members of the same political party. However, this element of
              | the bill was taken out by the Conference Committee just prior to its final passage
              | and so never actually went into law. Although there have been myriad attempts at
              | reforming the structure of the Fed since this bill, none have succeeded in initiating
              | changes in the composition of the FOMC so the party quotas are still no more than
              | an idea. There may be other reasons for Congress to avoid implementing this rule, a
              | topic beyond the score of this chapter, but for those interested in helping prevent the
              | Fed from implementing accomodative monetary policy around elections, this may be
              | a solution.

blank         | 
text          | As the US financial crisis of 2007–2009 unfolded, financial institutions became in-
              | creasingly unable to sell their assets (particularly those tied to the housing market)
              | and generate the capital needed to fund their lending activities. In response to these
              | severe liquidity constraints, the Federal Reserve engaged in an unprecedented level of
              | lending to the private financial industry. One substantial concern associated with this
              | lending is that it could potentially be gamed by rent-seeking financial institutions.
              | In other words, private banks may have attempted to use political levers to influence
              | the Fed’s administration of these lending programs in a way that would benefit their
              | bottom line.

text          | more from the Federal Reserve’s lending during the financial crisis? Despite the policy
              | salience of this question (billions of dollars were at stake), there have been no prior
              | attempts to answer it, at least to the best of my knowledge. This study addresses
              | that hole, thereby taking a growing literature investigating the impact of political
              | influence on government lending into a new forum and ultimately provides a mixed
              | answer to this important set of questions.
              |    On one hand, my analysis of data only recently made available suggests that
              | financial institutions’ lobbying efforts targeting the Federal Reserve were unsuccessful.
              | That is, multivariate regressions report that such expenditures are not associated
              | with an increase in the probability of receiving funding from the Fed during the
              | financial crisis, after controlling for a host of firm-level covariates. On the other hand,
              | though, lobbying does seem to have been effective for healthier firms. Among this set
              | of financial institutions, greater lobbying expenditures are robustly correlated with
              | higher levels of income derived via funds borrowed from the Fed. This suggests that
              | many firms were engaging in rational political behavior, even if the Fed seems to have
              | succeeded in partially limiting the influence of external actors on the administration
              | of its lending programs during the financial crisis.
              |    This nuanced conclusion contributes to a literature that until now had provided
              | mostly binary conclusions about the effect of politics on the administration of gov-
              | ernmental lending programs during the financial crisis. While some recent literature
              | investigating the impact of firms’ political activities find only strong, positive effects
              | (e.g., Duchin and Sosyura 2012), others find no such effects (e.g., Fisman et al. 2006).
              | Here, however, I document how the virtually universal approved standard of central

title         | 4.1         Background: What did the Fed do?
blank         | 
text          | In 2007, as economic growth halted and problems in the housing market emerged,
              | financial institutions started feeling liquidity pressures and, as a result, increased
              | their borrowing from the Fed. At first, much of this borrowing was done through
              | the Fed’s discount window, the traditional mechanism through which the Fed acts
              | as a lender to banks. Chairman Bernanke and the Board of Governors used this
              | tool aggressively, slashing all three of the discount window’s rates, with the primary
              | credit rate dropping from 5.75% in August of 2007 to 0.5% by December 2008.1 In
              | addition to beginning to lower the rates that August, the Fed extended the maximum
              | term on primary credit loans to 30 days and then to 90 days in March 2008 (Federal
              | Reserve Bank 2011). Financial institutions responded to these policy changes by
meta          |    1
text          |     The Fed charges financial institutions one of three rates to borrow through the discount window:
              | the primary credit rate, which provides the cheapest capital to the healthiest firms in exchange for
              | higher quality capital, the secondary credit rate, which is higher and extended to firms that do not
              | qualify for the primary rate, and the seasonal credit rate, which is charged for loans lasting as long
              | as 9 months.

text          | borrowing in record numbers, with the value of discount window loans outstanding
              | averaging $30 billion per day during the financial crisis.2 This represents a jump
              | of 17,547.06% from the daily average between 2003 and 2006, when the comparable
              | amount was $170 million (Berger et al. 2014).
              |        As the subprime financial crisis became increasingly severe, investors became much
              | less willing to lend to financial institutions, prompting these institutions to have sig-
              | nificant liquidity pressures. To address this, Fed leaders decided a more innovative
              | and robust effort was needed, particularly to stimulate term funding markets. As a
              | result, on December 12, 2007, the Fed used its discount window authority to estab-
              | lish the Term Auction Facility (TAF), through which the Fed “auctioned longer-term
              | funds to depository institutions in exchange for discount window collateral” (Inspec-
              | tor General 2010, p. 17).3 During the 28 months TAF was operating (the program
              | ended on April 8, 2010), $3.82 trillion was lent out through some 4,200 transactions.
              | Daily TAF usage averaged approximately $191 billion during the crisis (Berger, Black,
              | Bouwman and Dlugosz 2014).
              |        Despite the robust nature of the TAF program, pressure on the term funding
              | markets continued. Thus, the Fed decided that its Open Market Trading Desk would
              | engage in a series of term repurchase transactions. To borrow through this mechanism,
              | formally referred to as single-tranche open market operations (ST OMO), the twenty
              | eligible institutions were required to make bids indicating the interest rate they were
              | willing to pay to receive the given amount of Fed capital. The results of the auctions
              | yielded capital being borrowed at rates as low as 0.01% in December, even when

text          | the Fed was charging 0.5% for financial institutions to borrow through its traditional
              | discount window (Wachtel 2011; Ivry 2011). Ultimately, the Fed used ST OMO to
              | make a series of 28-day loans to eleven financial institutions from March 7, 2008 to
              | December of that year.4
              |        However, even with this innovative combination of lending through the discount
              | window, the TAF, and ST OMO, the Fed again decided that more action was needed
              | to “avoid systemic financial failure within the US economy” (Inspector General 2010,
              | 17). Thus, using the “usual and exigent circumstances” authority of section 13(3)
              | of the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed’s Board created and implemented a variety of
              | extraordinary and specially targeted lending measures to act as a lender of last resort
              | to a variety of corporations and financial institutions. Between March and November
              | 2008, six such programs were introduced: the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money
              | Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF), the Commercial Paper Funding
              | Facility (CCFF), the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the Term Securities
              | Lending Facility (TSLF), the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF),
              | and the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF).5
              |        The first of these new extraordinary programs, the TSLF, was created on March
              | 11, 2008, and offered additional assistance to primary dealers facing term funding
              | pressures.6 Through this program, the Fed “loaned relatively liquid Treasury secu-

              | ($15 billion), Morgan Stanley ($12 billion), BNP Paribas ($10 billion), Citigroup ($2.8 billion),
              | JPMorgan Chase ($1 billion), and Merrill Lynch ($4.7 billion). The peak amount outstanding was

              | March 27, 2008, when the Fed held the first auction to allocate the loans via the
              | TSLF, and February 1, 2010, when the last auctions closed, financial institutions
              | borrowed over $2 trillion via 558 transactions.
              |       Like its predecessors, the implementation of this new program did not alleviate
              | all of the primary dealers’ stressors. Another challenge for this group came from
              | the triparty repurchase agreement market. To alleviate the pressure on this front,
              | the Fed created the PDCF on March 16, 2008. Through the PDCF, the Fed made
              | overnight loans to primary dealers, just as it does with depository institutions via
              | its discount window. The Fed started making loans via the PDCF the day after
              | the announcement of its creation and continued doing so through May 12, 2009,
              | ultimately extending $8.95 trillion to the participating financial institutions (Federal
              | Reserve System 2012c).
              |       Next, on September 19, 2008, only three days after the Lehman Brothers’ collapse
              | had triggered the collapse of the $62.5 Reserve Primary Fund and a more general
              | run on money market funds, the Fed announced that it was establishing the AMLF.
              | Through the AMLF, the Fed was able to “help money market mutual funds (MMMFs)
              | that held asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) meet investors’ demands for re-
              | demptions, and to foster liquidity in the ABCP market and money markets more
              | generally” (Federal Reserve System 2012a).7 To do this, the Fed offered non-recourse
              | loans to financial institutions that then used this capital to purchase ABCP from the
              | participating MMMFs. The program was successful in this mission: the market for

              | quality asset-backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds” (Federal Reserve System
meta          | 2008).

              | short-term financing (i.e., liquidity) for a variety of companies, continued to function,
              | and no other money market mutual funds collapsed as result of not being able to
              | meet their redemptions. From September 22, 2008, when the program officially came
              | online, to February 1, 2010, when it was terminated, the AMLF had been used by
              | financial institutions to borrow $217 billion.8
              |        Despite this robust effort in shoring up the ABCP market, the Fed decided that
              | the spiking interest rates and declining volume of notes outstanding in the broader
              | commercial paper market warranted further action. The organization announced on
              | October 7, 2008 that it would serve as a buyer in this market if need be. To begin the
              | program, the Fed created an entirely new private subsidiary, the CPFF LLC. This
              | new limited liability company received funding from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
              | York (FRBNY) via three-month loans. The proceeds of these loans were then used
              | to “purchase commercial paper directly from eligible issuers (Federal Reserve System
              | 2012b). To remediate the risk of holding these notes, CPFF LLC charged issuers fees,
              | collecting a total of $849 million (ibid). Ultimately, between October 27, 2008, when it
              | made its first purchases, and August 30, 2010, when the CPFF LLC was dissolved, the
              | FRBNY loaned over $739 billion to the CPFF LLC and that organization purchased
              | a near identical amount of commercial paper.

              | sion in their studies on the impact of political connections in Indonesia and Pakistan,

              | the firm that they are lending to will not be allowed to go bankrupt and thus offer
              | loans at lower rates.

text          | Building off of this idea, others have recently found that politics affected the federal
              | government’s behavior in the recent financial crisis. Acemoglu et al. (2013) argue
              | that investors perceived that firms that had personal connections to Secretary of the
              | Treasury Timothy Geithner would benefit from their relationship during the govern-
              | ment’s bailout efforts. Similarly, Duchin and Sosyura (2012) argue that measures of
              | financial institutions’ political influence, such as personal connections to high-level
              | government officials, campaign contributions, and lobbying efforts, are robustly asso-
              | ciated with receiving funds in the Treasury-administered Capital Purchase Program
              | (CPP), a part of the broader Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). Veronesi and
              | Zingales (2010), Li (2010), and Helmond (2010) provide corroborating evidence in
              | their own studies of the CPP and TARP. Perhaps financial institutions themselves
              | believe that political activities can affect their treatment by regulators and propen-
              | sity to be bailed out, since lenders lobbying more are more prone to engage in riskier
              | lending (Igan, Mishra and Tressel 2011).
              |    However, these claims that political connections and influence matter in the US are
              | far from universally accepted. Exemplifying the strand of scholarship suggesting that
              | connections and influence do not matter, Fisman et al. (2006, p. 1) conclude,“U.S.
              | institutions are effective in controlling rent-seeking through personal ties with high-
              | level government officials.” Even when political relationships do appear to have an
              | effect in the US, their substantive effect is relatively minor. For example, Jayachan-
              | dran (2006) finds that firms’ campaign contribution do not impact their market value

              | and the “distribution of federal benefits” (p. 31).
              |    Addressing the idea that government lending to private enterprises is affected by
              | politics, Cortés and Lerner (2011) show that political connections do not affect grants
              | made by the Community Development Financial Institution. In a similar context,
              | Puente and Wilson (2013) find that the community banks’ campaign contributions
              | are not systematic predictors of funding received from the Treasury’s Community De-
              | velopment Capital Initiative. In addition, Puente (2012) reports that more politically
              | active and better-connected financial institutions did not receive preferential terms
              | from the Department of the Treasury when exiting TARP.
              |    This ambiguity is compounded by the fact that there is little work specifically
              | investigating the firm-level determinants of the Fed’s lending decisions. The scholar-
              | ship that does exist focuses exclusively on the financial covariates associated with firm
              | borrowing. Berger et al. (2014) finds evidence that, among large banks, healthier in-
              | stitutions borrowed more, a finding inconsistent with the Lender of Last Resort theory
              | that central bank funding is usually tapped by weaker institutions. However, study-
              | ing the same question with only a slightly different sample, the analysis conducted by
              | Boyson, Helwege and Jindra (2014) generates the opposite conclusion: weaker banks
              | borrowed more from the Fed. In the only other work focusing on the potential im-

              | suggests that the Fed “discriminated” in its administration of central bank swap lines

text          | The Fed’s responses to the financial crisis of 2007–2009 ranged widely in terms of
              | their target constituency. Many of the programs, such as the TSLF, were designed to
              | ease pressures faced by primary dealers, while others, like ST OMO, were only used
              | by a few systemically important institutions. To maximize the breadth of the sample
              | without sacrificing a high-level of consistency of comparisons across these different
              | programs, like Boyson, Helwege and Jindra (2014) and Berger et al. (2014), I focus on
              | the two designed to benefit commercial banks operating in the United States: TAF
              | and the discount window.
              |        There were 7,219 commercial banks operating at the start of the financial crisis
              | (the fourth quarter of 2007), though the vast majority of these were small, locally
              | operated banks. Such institutions generally lack the economies of scale to engage
              | in autonomous political activities on the federal level and rarely turn to the Fed to
              | address their long-term liquidity constraints. Large commercial banks, on the other
              | hand, are known to do both. Thus, as Boyson, Helwege and Jindra (2014) do, I
              | restrict my sample to the bank holding companies of commercial banks with total
              | assets over $1 billion that operated for at least one quarter in the financial crisis.10

text          | Unlike Boyson, Helwege and Jindra (2014), however, I do not restrict the sample to
              | only include publicly traded companies since that introduces a potentially artificial
              | differentiation among firms over this size threshold and thus may induce bias into
              | the results. This leaves us with a sample of 442 distinct financial institutions in the
              | sample (from 27 different countries),11 121 of which borrowed from the TAF (27.38%
              | of the sample) and 93 of which borrowed from the discount window (21.04%). From
              | a temporal perspective, data are collected for the period widely seen as the duration
              | of the financial crisis: the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009.

text          | From the Bloomberg LP data, we can derive several measures of financial institu-
              | tions’ borrowing from the Fed in each quarter of the sample (Q42007–Q4 2009). The
              | simplest measure we can derive is a binary indicator variable, marked as one if the
              | institution borrowed at all from the Fed and as zero otherwise. To better understand
              | the mechanisms behind any patterns we observe, though, we want to disaggregate
              | this lending by the program source. Thus, I look at borrowing banks received from
              | the TAF and the discount window separately. We can add even more precision to this
              | by incorporating the number of days each institution borrowed from the Fed’s TAF
              | or its discount window. We can also measure the average daily outstanding balance
              | of each institutions’ debt from these two sources.

              | To do this, I employ the tax-adjusted net interest margin calculated by Bloomberg.
              | This is “the difference between what [banks] earn on loans and investments and what
              | they pay in borrowing expenses” (Kuntz and Ivry 2011). I convert this interest margin
              | into a quarterly percentage and then multiple it by the financial institution’s average
              | outstanding balance in Fed loans in that quarter. The final step of that calculation

text          |    Regulators and central bankers considering applications requesting liquidity pro-
              | visions are also likely to consider the institution’s capital adequacy. That is because
              | they will want to consider whether a bank has sufficient capital to withstand an eco-
              | nomic downturn or any other event inducing unexpected weakness into the balance
              | sheet. I measure this concept with the most common way to do so, the Risk-Adjusted
              | Tier 1 Capital Ratio.
              |    Banks’ asset quality is also likely to be considered when they are seeking lending.
              | This measure is relevant since it offers additional information about a bank’s health
              | during a crisis by accounting for how easily a bank can handle losses stemming from
              | nonperforming loans. Following standard conventions, I measure this as the ratio of
              | loan and lease allowance to total loans. To ease interpretation, I follow Duchin and
              | Sosyura (2012) in inverting the sign of this ratio “so that greater values of this proxy
              | reflect higher asset quality” or an easier ability to absorb losses (p. 45).
              |    To measure earnings I use each banks’ return on assets, calculated by dividing the
              | income earned in a quarter by their total book assets. This is an important control
              | since central bankers are seemingly unlikely to treat more profitable firms exactly the
              | same as their less profitable counterparts.
              |    Boyson, Helwege and Jindra (2014) suggest that “firms with high short-term debt
              | and low deposits are more likely to access the Fed programs” (p. 9). Thus, I control
              | for both concepts, measuring the former as debt in current liabilities divided by total
              | book assets and the latter as total deposits over total book assets.
              |    Finally, I control for leverage to account for a financial institution’s risk level. I
              | measure this as total debt divided by total book assets, as is typically done. These

              | Senate, or the Fed itself are among the agencies targeted. I add a second filter to
              | exclude any lobbying on issues other than banking, finance, or bankruptcy.14 Finally,
              | I calculate each firm’s total expenditures from this set of “relevant” lobbying efforts
              | made between the current quarter and that quarter in the previous year, inclusive.
              | While only a relatively small percentage of firms participated in lobbying, those that
              | did spent over a million dollars a year doing so, on average (see Table 4.2 in the

              |        As with lobbying, though, a firm could be very active in making campaign contri-

              | that have a clearly established interest – not to mention a statutory mandate – in
              | oversight of the Fed. During the period of interest, the two committees that played
              | by far the biggest (public) roles in oversight of the Fed are the Financial Services
              | Committee in the House of Representatives and the Banking, Housing, and Urban
              | Affairs Committee in the Senate.17 73 representatives served on the former in the
              | 110th and 111th Congresses and 31 senators (from 28 states) on the latter.18
              |     While these committees served as the primary forums for public legislative over-

              | private correspondence. Typically, this information would not be revealed and there-

              | request to the Fed’s Board of Governors to uncover all previously confidential cor-

              | time, Ben Bernanke). Since the latter group primarily consists of letters responding
              | to the ones first sent by members of Congress and periodic (and statutorily obligated)
              | transparency disclosures, I focus on the former group for the purposes of my analysis.
              | Unsurprisingly, letters originating from a heterogenous set of congresspersons also
              | tend to express a variety of messages. A majority (45 of the 69) expressed enthusiasm
              | for the lending program in some capacity, though never with overt encouragement to
              | make loans to specific institutions. Another 19 letters struck a more neutral tone
              | in the questions expressed or information requested. Only five of the letters from
              | congresspersons were outright critical of the Fed’s lending.
              |    With this information, I created a new subset of congresspersons composed of
              | members that had written a sole-authored letter to the Board of Governors on the
              | topic of the Fed’s lending during the financial crisis with either a neutral or positive
              | tone. I ignored those only listed on co-authored letters because including one’s name
              | on a mass-signed (the mean number of signatories in a co-authored letter in this data
              | set is 7.9) letter is relatively costless. Therefore, this “uncostly” signal is unlikely
              | to change the Fed’s decisions regarding the set of institutions with which those con-
              | gresspersons have relationships. Similarly, it seems implausible that the Fed would
              | respond to a letter from a congressperson that expresses disdain for the lending in
              | general by increasing said lending to firms that they may have relationships with.
              | Put simply, if the Fed is influenced at all by private correspondence from members
              | of Congress, it is only likely to when letters are written on their own expressing in-
              | dividualistic preferences consistent with an expansion in lending, hence the focus on
              | sole-authored letters with a positive or neutral tone towards the Fed’s lending.

text          |    In total, this set of congresspersons includes 22 representatives and 12 senators
              | (from 11 states). Some of these were not surprising at all; for example, Representative
              | Barney Frank (D–MA), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and
              | Senator Chris Dodd (D–CT), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, were
              | both frequent letter writers. 11 of the representatives writing such letters also served
              | on the House Financial Services Committee, while 4 of the senators doing so were
              | members of the Senate Banking Committee.
              |    Others in the group were less obvious, though not entirely surprising candidates to
              | engage in private correspondence with the Fed. Among this latter group were Iowa’s
              | two senators, Tom Harkin (D-IA), the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor,
              | and Pensions Committee, and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the ranking member of the
              | Senate Finance Committee. Another committee somewhat well represented among
              | the Senate letter writers is the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. In
              | the House, some prominent leaders from outside the Financial Services Committee
              | also wrote letters, including Representative Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY), Chair of

              | the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Of course, however, there

              | donation to members of the House Financial Services Committee is $15,340. The

              | in the full bank-quarter panel data set.
              |    Of course, financial institutions can also develop relationships with congressper-
              | sons by simply being headquartered in that individual’s district. That is, if a bank
              | is based in the congressional district of a representative or the state of a senator,
              | the policymaker will have a clear interest in promoting policies that will benefit the
              | financial institution. After all, if the banks based in their district or state are more
              | profitable, then those institutions will be able to employ more individuals and extend
              | more credit to the homeowners, consumers, and small businesses that are a core part
              | of their constituency.
              |    Moreover, a legislator’s ability to achieve positive policy outcomes for banks in

              | ships between the primary independent variables of interest and participation in the
              | Fed’s two lending programs offered to commercial banks during the financial crisis:
              | the TAF and the discount window. The differences that emerge offers evidence in
              | favor of the hypothesis that the most politically active institutions were more likely to
              | receive funding from the Fed. T tests show that the firms offering more campaign con-
              | tributions to congresspersons expressing an interest in the Fed’s lending and spending
              | more on lobbying salient policymakers consistently received more funding from the

              |    However, this pattern appears to be limited to the variables measuring political
              | expenditures. The univariate differences mostly disappear when comparing borrowing
              | from banks headquartered in districts represented by relevant congresspersons to
              | those with headquarters elsewhere. The one exception is that there is limited evidence
              | suggesting that banks represented in the House by members of the Financial Services

              |    The opposite is true for those represented by congresspersons writing letters to
              | the Fed: those based in these districts were far less likely to participate in TAF
              | and somewhat less likely to borrow from the discount window. This suggests that
              | legislators’ letters may have been a reaction to suboptimal lending outcomes – or
              | expectations of such outcomes – (i.e., a dearth of borrowing among the financial
              | institutions they have developed relationships with) instead of attempts to prevent
              | deviations from positive outcomes. Similarly, the t tests present modest evidence

              |     Of course, however, these simple analyses may provide misleading conclusions
              | since the political variables of interest are not randomly assigned across firms.23 Thus,

              | about the impact that firms’ political activities had on their borrowing from the
              | Fed. While the logit and tobit models (described in subsection 4.3.2 above) do not

              | alyzing the dichotomous TAF borrowing variable when controlling for relationships
              | with congressperson writing letters to the Fed’s Board of Governors on the topic of
              | direct lending during the financial crisis.
              |        On the issue of congressional representation, though, the pattern is contrary to
              | the theoretical expectations: firms whose headquarters resided in the district of the
              | House Financial Services Committee or the district or state of a congressional letter
              | writer were actually less likely to receive TAF funding. There is one small exception
              | here, though: banks headquartered in states with senators serving on the Senate
              | Banking Committee were no less likely to borrow from TAF.
              |        Additional evidence suggesting that political activities may be attempts to reverse
              | unsuccessful relationships with the Fed comes when analyzing variation in borrowing
              | from the discount window (Tables 4.9–4.11). Once again, firms located in the district
              | of a congressperson serving on a relevant committee or expressing interest in Fed
              | lending appear less likely to borrow from the Fed’s discount window.24
              |        As introduced above, this pattern suggests congresspersons focusing on oversight
              | of the Fed may be more motivated by acquiring gains for the banks in their district
              | than avoiding losses. In other words, it could be the case that policymakers are
              | expending their resources (through the seeking of relevant committee assignments or
              | by directly generating correspondence to central bankers) to attempt to help firms
              | struggling in their interactions with central bankers at the Fed. However, it appears
              | such efforts were not successful in changing the nature of lending during the financial

              |       This second set of regressions also show a robust negative correlation between
              | lobbying expenditures and the degree to which financial institutions borrow from
              | the discount window. The implication of this pattern is substantively consistent
              | with the previous point: firms are lobbying Congress and the Fed in a seemingly
              | unsuccessful effort to generate more lending for themselves. Moreover, that these
              | findings from analyzing borrowing from this permanent source – the discount window
              | – are stronger than when looking solely at the transitory TAF makes sense. Firms
              | and their congressional allies would be most rational to more heavily weight their
              | participation (or lack thereof) in the discount window when deciding how to allocate
              | their political resources targeting the Fed since, unlike TAF, it is a permanent source
              | of funding.
              |       Regardless of the roots behind the negative correlations between this set of politi-
              | cal variables and borrowing activities, the Fed does not appear to have been foolproof
              | in insulating itself from external influence during the administration of its lending dur-
              | ing the financial crisis. As Table 4.12 shows, there is a persistent correlation between
              | relevant lobbying expenditures and income derived from TAF borrowing. As first
              | explained in Subsection 4.3.2, this specification of the dependent variable can only
              | be calculated for the subset of firms in the sample that actually borrowed from TAF.
              | Thus, this finding suggests that conditional on applying and being selected for TAF
              | funding at least once, lobbying is a highly profitable strategy.
              |       In terms of magnitude, the coefficients produced by the tobit regressions suggests
              | that a 100% change in relevant lobbying expenditures will generate between a 50.4
              | and 79.6% increase in the amount of income derived from TAF borrowing.25 Since the

              | the amount of income generated by borrowing at the below-market-rates offered by
              | TAF, this represents a very profitable arbitrage opportunity. Highlighting this, the
              | mean amount lobbied in a given year (conditional on lobbying at all) is $1,014,901,
              | while the mean income derived is $751,630.4 per quarter.26
              |     We can be more confident of the profitability of this lobbying strategy among
              | this subset of participating firms by comparing the results displayed in Table 4.12 to
              | those in Table 4.13. The only difference between these two regression specifications is
              | that the latter replaces “relevant” lobbying expenditures (defined in Subsection 4.3.4
              | above) with “irrelevant” lobbying expenditures. While the former solely includes
              | lobbying transactions pertaining to bankruptcy, banking, and finance, and targeting
              | Congress or the Fed, the latter only includes transactions in which the issue area and
              | / or the agency targeted was unrelated to the Fed’s lending program. As Table 4.13
              | shows, banks more actively engaging in this form of “placebo” lobbying derived no
              | more profits, on average, than their otherwise comparable counterparts (hence the
              | statistically insignificant coefficients on the lobbying expenditures variable in this set
              | of tobit regressions).
              |     To further investigate the scope conditions under which lobbying is associated
              | with higher levels of income derived from TAF, I ran a set of regressions that add
              | in an interaction effect between lobbying and firm type. The goal here is to see if
              | the effect of lobbying is conditional on the firm’s underlying health. To do this, I
              | classified each firm-quarter observation as one of three types: “healthy,” “illiquid,” or
              | calculated by multiplying the coefficient estimates for lobbying expenditures (from Table 4.12) by
              | 100.

text          | “unhealthy.” These are all relative classifications based upon the two main financial
              | factors influencing firm profits from TAF: liquidity and asset quality (see the regres-
              | sion results reported in Tables 4.12 and 4.15).27 Those deemed healthy were at least
              | in the 25th percentile in both liquidity and asset quality. I classified firms as illiquid
              | if they were below the 25th percentile in liquidity but above that threshold for asset
              | quality. Finally, firms below the 25th percentile in asset quality were classified as
              | unhealthy. With these coding guidelines, I classified 348 bank-quarter observations
              | as healthy, 136 as illiquid, and 162 as unhealthy.
              |        I then ran a series of regressions investigating how the effect of lobbying differed
              | across these three types of firms. These regressions, reported in Table 4.14, suggest
              | that lobbying is an effective use of a firm’s resources only when they are healthy. The
              | marginal effects plots displayed in Figure 4.2 demonstrate this with greater clarity:
              | there is only a positive relationship between lobbying expenditures and income de-
              | rived from TAF when the firm engaging in that lobbying is above the 25th percentile
              | in both its liquidity and asset quality (i.e., in the healthy category). This finding
              | further illustrates how, for the firms most likely to qualify for borrowing from the
              | Fed, lobbying was a profitable use of their resources. For those with even temporarily
              | weaker balance sheets, however, lobbying appears to have been an exercise in futility.
              | That is, spending more on this activity is not associated with an increase in profits
              | derived from TAF for the firms classified as either illiquid or unhealthy, hence the flat
              | slopes seen in Figure 4.2 for these groups.

text          | bigger firms received more funding from the Fed via both the TAF and its discount
              | window. They do not, however, make more money off of these loans, as demonstrated
              | by the statistically insignificant coefficients for the Total Assets variable in Table
              | 4.12. More profitable firms – those with a higher return on assets – did not receive
              | more funding nor did they make more money from such loans. Similarly, a firm’s
              | capitalization does not seem to have affected its borrowing from the Fed during the
              | crisis, as evidenced by the lack of a robust correlation between the Tier 1 Ratio
              | variable and the various specifications of the dependent variable.
              |    Those with high quality assets borrowed less actively from the discount window,
              | but benefited more by borrowing from the TAF. The former result is consistent with
              | that of Boyson, Helwege and Jindra (2014), as is the finding that less liquid firms,
              | those with more short-term debt, and banks with fewer deposits (a stable source of
              | liabilities) to assets borrowed less. Put simply, banks with more short-term funding
              | needs do seem to have borrowed more, contrary to what Berger et al. (2014) claim.
              | Finally, consistent with expectations, foreign institutions borrowed less, though their
              | nationality did not affect their ability to profit from such lending.
              |    When regressing only financial covariates against income derived from TAF, these
              | same conclusions hold. As shown in Table 4.15 and in the marginal effects plots shown
              | in Figure 4.3, firms with higher quality assets profited more from this extraordinary
              | lending program, as did those with less liquid balance sheets and more short-term
              | debt on their books. This is also a robust negative correlation between firms’ ratios
              | of deposits to assets to the income derived from TAF.
              |    This regression with only financial covariates also reveals that adding political
              | covariates and the primary outcome of interest: income derived from the TAF. Thus, transformations
              | of these variables do not improve model fits.

              | how well it fits the data when compared to regression specifications with the full set
              | of political variables as well as those adding in interaction effects. This corroborates
              | the conclusion made above that politics seem to have played a minor role in the
              | administration of the Fed’s lending during the financial crisis. That does not mean
              | that political influence attempts were never successful, though. It is just that only

              | from liquidity constraints and lower asset qualities do no appear to have profited from

title         | 4.5         Conclusion
blank         | 
text          | The analysis presented above and documented in the Appendix offers two related
              | conclusions. First, it appears that, for many firms, attempting to influence the Fed
              | and change the way in which it was administering its lending during the financial
              | crisis was unsuccessful. It would be a stretch to infer that lobbying or attempting
              | to cultivate partnerships in Congress is counterproductive (i.e., that it causes firms’
              | borrowing usage and intensity to decrease). Nevertheless, these findings do suggest
              | that much of the political behavior surrounding the Fed during the financial crisis
              | were attempts to generate gains that did not achieve the desired outcomes.29
              |        On the other hand, there does appear to be evidence that, among firms that sought
              | and qualified for funding from the Fed, lobbying was a profitable endeavor. For this
meta          |   29
text          |     I want to be careful to not overstate the generalizability of this conclusion, though, by claim-
              | ing that this evidence provides conclusive proof that legislators and firms are generally motivated
              | primarily by gain acquisition in their political behavior.

text          | group, there is a reasonably robust relationship between the amount of money spent
              | on “relevant” lobbying and the income derived from TAF borrowing. Confidence
              | that this is not a spurious correlation is further increased by the lack of a significant
              | findings when the lobbying variable is adjusted to include only lobbying expenditures
              | on issues unrelated to oversight or administration of the Fed’s lending programs.
              |        This set of findings only partially corroborates Chairman Bernanke’s claim that
              | “an institution that was eligible to participate could do so if it chose without the need
              | for ‘influence,’ while an institution that was not eligible would not have been able
              | to participate without regard to any efforts at influence.”30 The second part of this
              | claim seems to hold up upon closer inspection, but the first is much more specious.
              |        While the pattern uncovered here does not definitively prove that lobbying caused
              | the Fed to offer more funding to firms engaging in such activity, this finding should
              | nonetheless be concerning since even the perception of a central bank that can be in-
              | fluenced by external political pressure is damaging to its ability to pursue its mandate
              | of financial stability. Given this practical importance and the absence of other schol-
              | arship on the topic, I invite additional work to provide further clarity on the contexts
              | in which lobbying (and similar initiatives) can successfully influence the Fed.

text          | With my dissertation, I focus on understanding how political institutions and pres-
              | sures affect policy implementation at the Federal Reserve. Although the Fed is often
              | seen as a largely politically insulated institution that makes decisions free from exter-
              | nal influence and without regard to political biases, my dissertation suggests that this
              | perception is not entirely accurate. Despite the popularity of that conception, this
              | result really is not surprising given the intent of the framers of the modern Federal
              | Reserve. As documented in Chapter 2, the architects of the institution’s restructuring
              | in 1935 designed the institution to allow partial political influence, but not so much
              | that politics would dominate the institution. In this way, we should interpret the
              | results from the other chapters as evidence that this vision succeeded. That elections
              | can impact monetary policymakers when one party controls the FOMC is only pos-
              | sible thanks to the structural reforms produced by the Banking Act of 1935; without
              | that reform, no party would have such an ability. The benefits of lobbying we see
              | in Chapter 4 are also only present because of that reform. This is for two reasons:
              | first, prior to the 1935 reform, Congress had far less oversight over what was then a

text          | decentralized institution, and second, that institution lacked the ability to generate
              | the robust level of lending that modern financial institutions have benefitted from.
              |    Although this dissertation maintains a specific focus on determining the various
              | ways in which politics affects the policies made by the American central bank, its con-
              | clusions should not construed as myopic. Perhaps most obviously, once differences in
              | institutional design have been accounted for, its lessons can be used to help better
              | understand the impact of political dynamics on other central banks. This is particu-
              | larly true in the case of financial institutions using external influence to affect central
              | banks in their role of lender of last resort. The conclusions from this dissertation also
              | inform us about the difficulty of eliminating electoral cycles from public policy. After
              | all, if a political business cycle can manifest at the Fed, arguably the most politically
              | insulated institution in American government, then it will be quite the challenge to
              | prevent electoral cycles in settings in which the policymakers are more closely con-
              | nected to voters. Finally, the chapter on the politics behind the Fed’s restructuring
              | illustrates the importance that the veto points inherent in the industrial organization
              | of Congress can have on attempts at policy change as well as how exogenous shocks
              | can induce shifts in preferences that ultimately generate changes in policy.
              |    An additional benefit to the work presented in this dissertation is that it has many
              | natural extensions. For example, my chapter on the structure of the Federal Reserve
              | describes the politics behind the creation of the Fed in 1913 and its reform in 1935,
              | but focuses less on the lack of reform in the subsequent 90 years. This lack of change
              | comes despite the introduction of many proposals in Congress to further reform the
              | structure of the Fed, including some by prominent policymakers.
              |    For example, in 1975, Senator Hubert Humphrey (D–MN) introduced S. 2540,

              | 
text          | which would have removed the Reserve bank presidents from the FOMC, reduced
              | the terms of appointees from fourteen to seven years, and added two members to the
              | committee from the cabinet. However, this proposal never made it out of committee.1
              | While this outcome was fairly predictable given a lack of unified Democratic control
              | of government at the time it was introduced, it is more surprising that Representative
              | Barney Frank’s (D–MA) was not able usher in an almost identical structural reform.
              | He tried to do so with his H.R. 1512 in the 111th Congress, but only after his party
              | had lost control of the House of Representatives. Had he been more proactive when he
              | chaired the House Financial Services Committee, he surely would have gotten closer
              | to getting the bill passed.
              |        Of course, even then nothing is guaranteed. As Krehbiel, Meirowitz and Wiseman
              | (2015) point out, the minority party and moderates in the governing coalition can still
              | effectively limit moving policy to the extreme – as Frank’s proposal would have done.
              | The question that remains, though, is what precisely was different in 2010, and other
              | years in which one party controlled government, when compared to 1935? Was the
              | cost needed to generate structural reform in this recent example not sufficiently offset
              | by the benefit of such change or is another factor to blame? Further investigating this
              | could further improve our understanding of when and why legislative adjustments are
              | made to agency design and other policies already on the books.
              |        The investigation into the impact that elections have on the recommendations
              | of monetary policymakers serving on the FOMC presented in Chapter 3 somewhat
              | abstracts away from the potential role of strategy in these meetings. While per-
              | sonal, in-person interviews with former Fed officials provide further confidence that

text          |     There have also been plenty of unsuccessful proposals from Republican policymakers designed
              | to move the Fed in the opposite direction by, for example, making all twelve Reserve bank presidents
              | permanent members of the FOMC (see S. 238 H.R. 1174 from the 113th Congress).

              | (hence my focus on the transcripts instead of the votes), it could be the case that
              | the chair is more considerate of others’ opinions since she does not want to be rolled.
              | The question here is as follows: is the chair simply reflecting the position of the me-
              | dian voter on the committee, making her own recommendation independently of the
              | others, or doing some combination of the two? This question has yet to be explored
              | in depth by the scholarship pertaining to central bank decision-making and is thus
              | an area ripe for new research.
              |        Another question that arises from this research on the politics behind monetary
              | policy decisions pertains to the appointment procedure. Each of the last four pres-
              | idential administrations has had at least two vacancies on the Board of Governors
              | simultaneously open for a period of over six months. Figure 5.1 illustrates this point;
              | the white space representing an unfilled seat is readily apparent to the eye. Table 5.1
              | offers more details on this puzzle within the Clinton presidency, showing the precise
              | appointment lags associated with each vacancy on the Board during that adminis-
              | tration. Needless to say, in each of these four White Houses, the puzzle is apparent:
              | given the substantial impact that monetary policy can have on the economy – and,
              | as I suggest, elections – why do appointments to the FOMC take so long?2
              |        While I focused on the impact that myopic voters may have on monetary policy-
              | makers, there is still much to be learned about the inverse relationship. While there
              | is evidence that citizens incorporate short-term fluctuations in the macro-economy
              | when voting, we know less about the precise transmission of this information. More
              | specifically, very little has been written about how quickly monetary policy can affect

text          | voters. Preliminary evidence from the 2012 election suggests that the third round
              | of quantitative easing, a classic case of monetary expansion (labelled QE3 in Figure
              | 5.2), resulted in a spike in the probability of President Obama’s re-election prob-
              | ability as quantified by Intrade, a prediction market.3 Additional analyses of this
              | question could improve our understanding of voter behavior and therefore clarify the
              | micro-foundations underpinning the political business cycle in monetary policy.
              |        Finally, the evidence from the previous chapter (4) analyzing the sources behind
              | firm-level variation in borrowing from the Fed suggests that some policymakers may
              | be expending their legislative resources in a way that reflects a desire to acquire gains
              | rather than prevent losses. If generalizable, this would be an important contribu-
              | tion to the field of legislative behavior, particularly since it is inconsistent with the
              | predictions from prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979).
              |        In addition, the negative correlation between relevant committee appointments
              | and some of the borrowing measures suggests that some legislators may be targeting
              | committee appointments that could help out businesses (and presumably constituents
              | too) that are struggling in their interactions with governmental agencies.4 Again, with
              | more data across more policy contexts,5 we could determine how widely that strategy
              | is being applied as well as at how seniority combines with committee membership to
              | generate desired gains.
              |        I look forward to working with my colleagues to pursue such research and thereby
