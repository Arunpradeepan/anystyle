              | Dissertation Abstract
text          |         This dissertation examines how terrestrial vertebrates, as seed dispersers, seed
              | predators and herbivores, influence plant functional trait composition in tropical forests and
              | thereby diversity. I conducted this work in the Barro Colorado National Monument (BCNM)
              | in Central Panama, where a long term mammal exclosure experiment has been ongoing, and in
              | neighboring Parque Nacional Soberanía (PNS), which together with the BCNM forms a
              | defaunation gradient driven by hunting.
              |         I first comprehensively review what is known about how the loss of vertebrates in
              | tropical forests alters plant-animal interactions, plant demography, and plant diversity.
              | Defaunation consistently lowers primary dispersal and creates a seed shadow that is more
              | dense around the parent tree and less dense at sites farther away. However, it also often
              | lowers seed predation by rodents, and as a consequence, species with rodents as seed predators
              | and dispersers often benefit from defaunation. While demographic and diversity responses
              | tend to be more mixed, a few consistent trends emerge. Community dominance tends to
              | increase in response to defaunation. Often, plants with particular functional traits or abiotic or
              | unhunted dispersal agents are favored by defaunation.
              |         I next examined how community-level functional trait composition shifts in seedling
              | communities (Chapter 2) and sapling communities (Chapter 3) which have experienced
              | exclosure from terrestrial mammals. Seedling communities in exclosures had higher median
              | seed mass than paired plots open to the mammal community, but treatments did not differ in
              | their leaf traits (leaf mass per area and laminar toughness) or wood density. In contrast to the
              | seedling community, the sapling community did show significant shifts toward higher specific
              | leaf area and lower leaf toughness in response to herbivore exclosure, primarily due to an
              | increased dominance of species with those traits, and secondarily due to differences in the

              | suggest that hunting results in community mean wood density in seedling communities, due to
              | a disproportionate number of high wood density species relying on hunted animals for their
              | seed dispersal.
              |         Finally, I investigated the seed size response to changes in mammal abundance by
              | measuring vertebrate seed predation rates in a protected and hunted forest (Chapter 4). I
              | found that in central Panama, seed mass does not correlate well with either body size of the
              | seed predator, or vertebrate seed predation rates. I suggest that rather than formulate seed
              | predation rates as a linear function of seed predator abundance, these interactions may be
              | better modeled as threshold-dependent processes.

text          | This work suggests that terrestrial vertebrates play an underappreciated role in maintaining
              | plant diversity and that pan-tropical levels of unsustainable hunting may indirectly lead to
              | losses of plant biodiversity.

text          | My deep gratitude goes to my two advisors, Rodolfo Dirzo and David Ackerly, for giving me
              | the flexibility and support to pursue this work. Rodolfo’s generosity as a teacher and advisor,
              | and his tireless contributions to teaching, research and conservation, both at Stanford and
              | internationally, are a great inspiration to me. I am thankful to David for graciously and
              | supportively allowing me to build a network of intellectual support that allowed me to
              | successfully complete this journey. He has also been an excellent intellectual role model for
              | me, challenging me to grapple with complexity and nuance and to confront problems from
              | new perspectives.
              |         Joe Wright has been a generous and supportive mentor and collaborator throughout
              | my time at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and some of this work would not have
              | been possible without his contributions. Peter Vitousek contributed many insightful
              | suggestions throughout the course of this work as a committee member, and his service
              | activities, from facilitating collaboration among scientists in Hawaii, to the First Nations’
              | Futures Program, have also inspired me. I also thank Fio Micheli for her enthusiasm as a
              | committee member and for helping me frame my work in a broader context. Walter Carson
              | very generously permitted me to work on the long-term mammal exclosure experiment he
              | established in the Barro Colorado National Monument in Panama and shared with me his
              | long-term datasets.
              |         The communities at Stanford, Berkeley and STRI were essential in shaping my
              | graduate school experience. At Stanford, Will Cornwell, Nathan Kraft, Virginia Maztek,
              | Steve Allison, Stephen Porder, Katie Amatangelo, Jen Funk, Camila Donatti, and Mauro
              | Galetti provided helpful feedback and support throughout the various stages of my work.
              | Doug Turner was an essential help in analyzing leaf nutrients, both for chapter three, and work
              | not included in this thesis. Alex Royo, Allen Herre, Scott Magnan, Liza Comita, Mike Tobin,

              | shared their advice and knowledge of the field site with me, improving the feasibility and
              | execution of this work.
              |         Many thanks go to the botanists at BCI. Without their assistance, this work would not
              | have been possible. Andrés Hernández, Oldemar Valdes, David Brassfield, and Osvaldo
              | Calderón were always happy to help me identify whatever leaf, fruit, seed, or flower I
              | brought to their office. Andrés and Oldemar in particular taught me most of what I know
              | about the BCI flora.
              |         Many paid and volunteer field and lab assistants helped to make this work possible.
              | Lissie Jiménez helped immensely with the collection and processing of the thousands of
              | leaves collected for Chapter three. Ana Patricia Calderón and Rousmery Bethancourt
              | contributed many early mornings conducting mammal transect surveys. Clare Sherman was
              | such a dedicated help in the lab and fieldwork for chapter 4, that I sometimes had to remind
              | her to take a break and have some fun. Susan Rebellon helped with the pilot studies for
              | chapter four, and also with leaf sample processing at Stanford. Gaspar Bruner, Karen
              | Kapheim, Adam Roddy, and David Bethancourt, helped me recover (most of) my leaf
              | samples after they were destroyed in a freezer accident.
              |         I would also like to thank staff at Stanford and STRI who helped make the logistical
              | aspects of this work easier. The competence of Pam Hung, Oris Acevedo, Belkys Jiménez,
              | Orelis Arosemana, and Marcela Paz made them a pleasure to work with. The Falconer library
              | and copy staff, as well as Allen Smith, did their best to get me the literature I needed, despite
              | STRI’s rigorous firewall. Valerie Kiszka and Jennifer Mason helped with countless
              | administrative tasks and advice during my time as a student at Stanford.

title         | Introduction
text          | Tropical forests are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. Many
              | mechanisms have been proposed to explain the maintenance of that diversity,
              | including negative distance- or density- dependent mortality, niche partitioning, and
              | neutral processes.   However, little attention has been paid to the role vertebrate
              | consumers play in maintaining tropical diversity. Evidence from defaunated tropical
              | forests suggests that these animals play a critical role in diversity maintenance
              | (Chapter 1). This dissertation examines how terrestrial vertebrates, as seed dispersers,
              | seed predators and herbivores, influence plant community composition in tropical
              | forests and thereby levels of diversity. Specifically, I used plant functional traits as a
              | lens through which to observe changes in seedling and sapling communities, identify
              | which guilds of consumers were responsible for the changes, and elucidate trait-
              | mediated mechanisms for the observed change. This work suggests that terrestrial
              | vertebrates play an underappreciated role in maintaining plant diversity and that pan-
              | tropical levels of unsustainable hunting may indirectly lead to losses of plant
              | biodiversity.
              |        I first examined how community-level functional trait composition shifts in
              | seedling communities which have been protected from terrestrial mammals (Chapter
              | 2). I conducted this work in the Barro Colorado National Monument in Central
              | Panama, where a long term mammal exclosure experiment was established in 1993-
              | 94, and where terrestrial mammals are relatively abundant. I found that seedling
              | communities in exclosures did not differ in their dispersal mode or in the relative
              | abundance of free standing and climbing growth forms, as may be expected in an
              | experiment that did not manipulate primary dispersal agents. Seedling communities in
              | exclosures had higher median seed mass than paired plots open to the mammal
              | community, but treatments did not differ in their leaf traits (leaf mass per area and

text          | laminar toughness) or wood density. These results were validated with similar data
              | from a defaunation gradient in the same region of Central Panama. One key contrast
              | to the exclosure, however, was that seedling communities in defaunated sites had a
              | higher representation of species with abiotic dispersal modes, lianas, and species with
              | lower wood densities, which is consistent with the fact that primary dispersers are
              | impacted by hunting.
              |        I next examined the sapling community in the exclosure experiment to evaluate
              | the effects of herbivores specifically, and to identify the relative contributions of
              | altered species present, abundance, and trait expression to the differences in functional
              | trait composition observed (Chapter 3). In contrast to the seedling community, the
              | sapling community did show significant shifts toward higher leaf nitrogen and lower
              | leaf toughness in response to herbivore exclosure, primarily due to an increased
              | dominance of species with those traits, and secondarily due to differences in the
              | species present in each treatment type.      Interestingly, I also found evidence that
              | intraspecific differences in leaf traits were also contributing minorly to changes in
              | community mean leaf toughness, though whether this is the result of differential
              | mortality among genotypes or microhabitats, or a plastic response to decreased
              | mammalian herbivory is unknown.
              |        Finally, I investigated the seed size response to changes in mammal abundance
              | by measuring vertebrate seed predation rates in a protected and hunted forest (Chapter
              | 4). I aimed to both test a model of how seed predation rates should vary with seed size
              | and defaunation intensity, and potentially clarify discrepancies in community level
              | seed-size responses to hunting at different sites. I found that in central Panama, seed
              | mass does not correlate well with either body size of the seed predator, or vertebrate
              | seed predation rates. In fact, I found little difference in seed predation rates between
              | the protected and hunted forests, despite large differences in key seed predators such
              | as peccaries and agoutis. I suggest that rather than formulate seed predation rates as a
              | linear function of seed predator abundance, these interactions may be better modeled
              | as threshold-dependent processes.

text          |          Large bodied vertebrates have been subject to human hunting for millennia. At
              | the end of the Pleistocene, a diversity of large mammals became extinct worldwide,
              | with human overhunting likely being one of the major drivers (Barnosky et al. 2004).
              | The extinction of mammoth, giant sloths, giant kangaroos, giant deer, and many more
              | megafauna in such a short time likely changed the structure and composition of their
              | associated plant communities (Zimov et al. 1995, Guimares et al. 2008, Johnson
              | 2009).
              |          The extinction of large vertebrates is not a phenomenon restricted to the past,
              | but rather continues in the present day. While scientists still debate what caused the
              | Pleistocene megafaunal extinction (Alroy 2001; de Vivo & Carmignotto 2004; Koch
              | & Barnosky 2006; Webb 2008), there is little doubt that human activities are
              | resposible for threatening the persistence of approximately 22 percent of all mammal
              | and 12 percent of all bird species in the world today (Pimm et al. 2006). Particularly
              | in tropical forests, animal populations are currently in decline due to both

              | comtemporaneous defaunation on vegetation is measurable. In many parts of the
              | tropics, plants have lost their major seeds dispersers, seed predators, and herbivores,
              | likely altering plant demography, spatial distribution, genetic diversity and selection
              | on seed and plant defense traits within species, with cascading effects on community

text          |     Because the animals most vulnerable to defaunation, as well as their less vulnerable
              | competitors, interact with plants as seed dispersers, seed predators, seedling predators,
              | and herbivores, contemporaneous defaunation is likely to disrupt plant-vertebrate
              | interactions. Several papers have outlined in detail how species interactions and plant
              | communities are likely to change as a consequence of these disruptions (Wright 2003,
              | Dirzo et al. 2007, Muller-Landau 2007). Disruptions of seed dispersal are likely to
              | have negative effects on plant recruitment by preventing individuals from escaping
              | distance-dependent and density-dependent mortality (sensu Janzen 1970, Connell
              | 1971). Reduced seed dispersal may also prevent light-demanding species, or species
              | with other specific environmental requirements, from reaching sites favorable for
              | recruitment (Muller-Landau 2007, Brodie et al. 2009). Changes in seed predation,
              | seedling predation, and herbivory may have positive or negative effects on species
              | recruitment by altering seed and seedling survival (Wright 2003, Dirzo et al. 2007,
              | Muller-Landau 2007). Changes in seed predation and seedling predation may have
              | further indirect benefits for invertebrate seed predators and herbivores.
              |           Overall, the net effect of defaunation on plant diversity has been hypothesized
              | to be negative (Wright 2003, Muller-Landau 2007) This is both because it is thought
              | that species experiencing reduced seed dispersal will not persist if they cannot escape

              | herbivores will not suppress populations of competitively dominant species.
              |        Here we synthesize what is currently known about the indirect effects of
              | defaunation on tropical plants, in the context of hunting, forest fragmentation, and
              | animal exclosure. We divide our analysis into three sections, addressing effects on
              | plant-animal interactions, population demography, and community diversity. Our first
              | goal was to evaluate the extent to which the hypothesized changes mentioned above
              | are supported by empirical evidence. Our second goal was to focus on plant species
              | or community responses that show mixed responses to defaunation, and try to clarify
              | why such variability may exist. Our third goal was to identify areas of study which
              | have received little attention and warrant future attention.

text          | where RD and RND are the magnitudes of the response variables in the defaunated and
              | non-defaunated sites, respectively. In cases where the denominator, RND, was zero, we
              | used the smallest possible non-zero value for RND (e.g. one seed, in the case of
              | absolute seed dispersal). When the minimum possible response could not be inferred
              | (e.g., a percent abundance), we conservatively estimated the effect size as 100 percent.
              | For example, where size class data were reported, sapling to seedling ratios were
              | calculated to allow for comparison of recruitment rates across studies.
              |        When studies reported response variables from multiple defaunated or non-
              | defaunated sites, the data were averaged to derive a single value for defaunated and
              | non-defaunated states. In studies of defaunation gradients, data on the abundance or
              | presence-absence of vertebrate species relevant to the study, as well as the authors’
              | categorical characterizations of the relative levels of defaunation were used to define
              | sites as “defaunated” or “non-defaunated” for purposes of comparison. In these cases,
              | sites experiencing the lowest levels of defaunation were often grouped with “no
              | defaunation” sites, while sites showing medium to high levels of defaunation
              | comprised the “defaunated” sites.

text          | QUANTIFICATION OF DEFAUNATION INTENSITY            We attempted to compare effects as a
              | function of defaunation intensity. We restricted these analyses to Neotropical sites
              | (70% of studies) because more extensive and comparative data on vertebrate
              | communities was reported for this region. We selected twelve genera of mammalian
              | frugivores, granivores, and browsers that differ in body mass and sensitivity to
              | defaunation pressures: Tapir, Tayassu, Pecari, Odocoileus, Mazama, Ateles, Allouata,
              | Cebus, Agouti, Dasyprocta, Sciurus and Proechimys. These genera are wide-ranging
              | in the Neotropics, though the particular species may vary. Because some studies did
              | not report animal abundances or densities, but rather species presence or absence, we
              | calculated the degree of defaunation for each site as the percent of focal genera that
              | appeared to be locally extirpated in that site, though present historically.

text          | SEED SIZE DATA     In several cases, the perturbations in plant-animal interactions as a
              | consequence of defaunation are hypothesized to vary as a function of seed size. We
              | therefore attempted to rank species by seed size in order to present the data in a way
              | that would address these hypotheses. In most cases, either seed mass or seed length
              | was reported.     In the case of Celtis durandii, one Astrocaryum species and one
              | unspecified Dipteryx species for which seed sizes were not reported, an approximate
              | seed size was estimated by assigning that species the value of a congeneric species
              | from another site. Species for which both length and mass were reported were used to
              | approximate a relative size rank for the species for which only mass or length were
              | reported.   Alternatively, we could have used published seed mass-seed length
              | correlations to estimate missing size parameters and used one measure of seed size to
              | assign size ranks. However, this would generally change the positions of only a few
              | species with unusual seed mass-to-seed length proportions (e.g. Gustavia superba),
              | and we felt that those species were better assigned a rank by considering the size
              | parameters in the context of the plant-animal interaction and the natural history of that
              | species.

title         | Seed dispersal
text          | Seed dispersal is thought to promote plant recruitment in tropical forests by facilitating
              | escape from natural enemies (Janzen 1970, Connell 1971) and by helping species with
              | particular environmental requirements for germination and survival (e.g. light-
              | demanding species) reach favorable microhabitats (Muller-Landau 2007).              Seed
              | dispersal establishes the spatial distribution and diversity of species in the seed and
              | seedling banks.
              |        A single seed can be dispersed multiple times by different agents. Here we
              | refer to primary seed dispersal as physical removal from the parent tree and deposition
              | on the ground. Primary seed dispersal can be performed by biotic agents such as
              | primates, bats, and birds, or by abiotic agents such as wind. Once a seed has dispersed
              | from the parent tree, it may still disperse further. This we refer to here as secondary

text          | dispersal. We focus on secondary dispersal by biotic agents such as rodents, though in
              | some circumstances, water and gravity may also facilitate dispersal on the ground.

              | 
text          | PRIMARY    SEED DISPERSAL         Seed dispersal by biotic agents should decrease as
              | defaunation intensity increases and the abundance of seed dispersers is reduced. This
              | should affect large-seeded species to a disproportionate degree for two reasons. First,
              | their predominate dispersal agents tend to be larger-bodied, and therefore more
              | vulnerable to defaunation (Peres & van Roosmalen 2002, Holbrook & Loiselle 2009).
              | There also appears to be less redundancy of seed dispersal agents for large-seeded
              | species, relative to smaller-seeded species (Peres & van Roosmalen 2002, Nuñez-Iturri
              | et al. 2008, Donatti et al. 2009). When seed dispersal has been directly measured,
              | either as the quantity of seeds removed by primary dispersers such as birds or
              | primates, or as the proportion of seed crop removed from a parent tree, seed dispersal
              | is lower in defaunated forests in almost all cases examined (Fig. 1.1). The magnitude
              | of the decrease appears to be moderately correlated with seed size.
              |        It is important to keep in mind that tropical seed mass distributions span more
              | than seven orders of magnitude (I.J. Wright et al. 2007). The species reported here
              | represent only the very upper range of that distribution and were generally selected for
              | study because they were most likely to show dispersal declines. Almost nothing is
              | known about how hunting alters biotic dispersal across the broader range of seed sizes
              | (Muller-Landau 2007).
              |        Two studies examining how perturbations of bird communities affect the
              | dispersal of smaller-seeded species (< 1 cm fruit diameter) have shown contrasting
              | results. Dispersal of Bocageopsis multiflora in defaunated sites was actually more than
              | 2-fold higher than in non-defaunated sites (Fig. 1.1). The cause of this increase is
              | unknown, but has been suggested to result from an increase in the relative abundance
              | of generalist, frugivorous birds in highly fragmented sites (Cramer et al. 2007). In the
              | case of Celtis durandii, a decrease in avian forest specialists that was not compensated
              | for by forests generalists appears to be responsible for in an overall decrease in seed
              | dispersal (Kirika et al. 2008).

text          | SEED CACHING A special case of seed dispersal is the caching of seeds in the ground
              | by scatter-hoarding rodents. While individual cached seeds may be predated at a later
              | time, seeds that are not subsequently recovered are afforded protection from
              | invertebrate seed predators.       For some species, such as large seeded palms with
              | specialist bruchid beetle seed predators, seed survival is heavily dependent upon seed
              | caching by rodents.

text          |         In most cases, seed caching was higher in defaunated sites relative to non-
              | defaunated sites (Fig. 1.2). This is likely due to the fact that the rodents primarily
              | responsible for seed caching in these forests, agoutis (Dasyprocta spp.) and squirrels
              | (Sciurus spp.) may actually benefit from a reduction in the abundance of predators and
              | larger-bodied competitors at low to medium levels of defaunation (Wright 2003, Dirzo
              | et al. 2007, Peres & Palacios 2007).             Therefore, while defaunation may have a
              | negative effect on primary dispersal, this negative effect often does not extend to
              | secondary seed dispersal by terrestrial rodents.

text          |         Defaunation gradients in Venezuela and Brazil were exceptions to the trend of
              | higher seed caching rates in defaunated forests (Asquith et al. 1999, Galetti et al.
              | 2006). In both of these cases, the defaunated sites were small fragments in which
              | agoutis were virtually absent. Consistent with the loss of this important terrestrial
              | seed disperser, seed caching in defaunated sites was lower than in non-defaunated sites
              | in these studies (Fig. 1.2). Squirrels do not compensate for the loss of agoutis (Donatti
              | et al. 2009).
              |         In contrast to primary dispersal, no relationship between seed size and
              | differences in caching rates were apparent between defaunated and non-defaunated
              | sites. This may again be due to the fact that agoutis are capable of handling large
              | seeds and fruits much larger than their relatively small gape size might suggest.
              | Therefore, in the Neotropics secondary dispersal of larger-seeded species may occur
              | despite some degree of defaunation, provided that agoutis persist in the site.
              |         Smaller-bodied scatter-hoarding rodents, such as squirrels, exist in Africa and
              | Asia, however to our knowledge, there is no functional equivalent to the agouti in
              | Paleotropical forests.    The larger Paleotropical rodents that do exist, such as
              | Cricetomys species, are larder-hoarding rodents that tend to take seeds to burrows
              | where they will not survive (Guedje et al. 2003).        Therefore, the seed dispersal
              | “buffer” that agoutis provide in the Neotropics is less likely to be present in other
              | systems.

text          | SPATIAL    DISTRIBUTION OF SEEDS AND SEEDLINGS        The spatial distribution of seeds
              | and seedlings on the forest floor can also be an indicator of changes in seed dispersal.
              | In particular, if seed dispersal is lower in defaunated forests, one would expect to find
              | a greater proportion of seeds or seedlings undispersed under parent trees relative to
              | what is observed in non-defaunated forests. Likewise, one would expect to see fewer
              | seeds or seedlings at distances away from parent trees relative to non-defaunated
              | forests. Indeed for many species, seed or seedling numbers under parent trees were 2-
              | to 12-fold higher in defaunated sites relative to non-defaunated sites, and were lower

text          | away from parent trees (Fig. 1.3). These patterns are consistent with the loss of biotic
              | dispersal agents.
              |        One notable exception is Hymenaea on land-bridge islands in Venezuela.
              | Hymenaea shows the highest increases in seed pods remaining under parent trees in
              | sites without agoutis relative to sites with agoutis. However, it is one of the few cases
              | in which seedling densities are actually lower under parent trees in defaunated forests
              | (Fig.1.3).   This is not due to distance or density dependent mortality effects as
              | mediated by specialist invertebrates or pathogens (Janzen 1970, Connell 1971).
              | Rather, Hymenaea relies on agoutis to open its seed pods so that seeds may germinate.
              | In sites lacking agoutis, the seeds cannot escape the seed pod, and seedling densities
              | are correspondingly low (Asquith et al. 1999).
              |        One study estimated changes in dispersal distances with defaunation. Cramer
              | et al. (2007) reported a 60 percent and 80 percent decrease in mean and maximum
              | dispersal distances respectively for the large-seeded Duckeodendron cestroides in
              | defaunated fragments, relative to continuous forest. In the same study, the smaller-
              | seeded Bocageopsis multiflora mean and maximum dispersal distances were not
              | significantly different. This suggests that large-seeded species may become more
              | spatially aggregated in defaunated forests.      Those plant species requiring special
              | microhabitats for germination and recruitment (e.g. light gaps) may have greater

text          | COMPENSATION       AMONG DISPERSAL AGENTS             An important question regarding seed
              | dispersal in tropical forests is whether a decrease in dispersal by the principle dispersal
              | agent may be compensated for by other dispersal agents. Comparisons of primate
              | diets suggest that smaller species of primates only disperse a nested subset of the plant
              | species that are dispersed by larger primates. Even when co-occurring dispersers

text          | appear to have significant dietary overlap on the basis of species consumed, a
              | quantitative diet analysis reveals that dispersers differ in the fruit species that make up
              | the major portion of their diets (Poulsen et al. 2002).         This suggests that even
              | dispersers with diet overlap may not compensate for one another. Similarly, among
              | frugivores that feed on Virola, alternative dispersers do not shift their diet preferences
              | enough to compensate for the loss of the principle dispersers (Holbrook & Loiselle
              | 2009).
              |          Decreases in primary seed dispersal summarized here (Fig. 1.1) suggest that
              | this lack of compensation among primary dispersal agents may be fairly general, at
              | least for larger-seeded species. There are no studies that directly investigate the
              | degree to which an increase in secondary dispersal by terrestrial vertebrates (e.g. Fig
              | 1.2) may compensate for reduced dispersal by birds and primates. However, in cases
              | where species have lost their primary dispersal agent, the number of seeds and
              | seedlings remaining under adult trees in defaunated sites is often higher than in non-
              | defaunated sites (Fig. 1.3). These data provide indirect evidence that, at least in the
              | cases studied, terrestrial seed dispersers do not fully compensate for loss of principle
              | avian and primate dispersers. It is possible, however, that terrestrial dispersers are
              | partially compensating for the loss of other dispersers, and that the observed changes
              | in seed and seedling densities under and away from parents would be even more
              | extreme in the absence of terrestrial dispersal.

text          | POST-DISPERSAL       SEED PREDATION   After primary dispersal, seeds may be predated
              | upon by terrestrial mammals such as rodents, peccaries, pigs and deer. The majority of
              | studies comparing seed predation rates between defaunated and non-defaunated sites
              | have performed manipulative experiments, setting out arrays of seeds and monitoring
              | the fates of those seeds. However a few studies of species with slowly decomposing
              | endocarps have looked at “standing” rates of seed predation in the field (Wright et al.
              | 2000, Wright & Duber 2001, Galetti et al. 2006). In 22 of the 31 cases, seed predation
              | rates were lower in defaunated sites, while in nine cases, seed predation rates were
              | higher (Fig. 1.4).
              |        In a conceptual model, larger-seeded species were hypothesized to experience
              | higher seed predation rates in moderately defaunated forests relative to non-
              | defaunated forests (Dirzo et al. 2007). At severe intensities of defaunation, however,
              | large-seeded species were hypothesized to experience lower seed predation rates,
              | relative to sites with moderate to no defaunation. These changes in seed predation
              | rates were posited to be in response to changes in the abundance of seed predators of
              | medium body size.
              |        Using our estimates of defaunation intensity for Neotropical sites, we
              | examined how differences in seed predation rates for different plant species varied
              | with defaunation intensity.     These empirical data do not generally support the
              | hypothesis that seed predation of larger seeds in moderately defaunated sites is higher
              | than non-defauanted sites, while being lower in highly defaunated sites. (Fig. 1.4).
              | Among the largest-seeded species studied, seed predation increased and decreased in
              | about the same number of cases across all levels of defaunation examined.
              |        The conceptual model also hypothesized that seed predation rates of smaller
              | seeded species would increase monotonically with increasing defaunation intensity, as
              | small rodents experienced release from competition and predation.              However
              | empirical data suggest that seed predation rates are generally lower for smaller-seeded
              | species in defaunated sites, regardless of defaunation intensity (Fig. 1.4).

text          | INVERTEBRATE SEED PREDATION                                               It has been suggested that a reduction in vertebrate
              | seed predation may benefit invertebrate seed predators in two ways.                                                      First,
              | invertebrates experience a release from competition for seed resources (Muller-Landau
              | 2007). Secondly, larvae developing in seeds may experience decreased mortality due
              | to the reduction of seed predation by vertebrates (Silvius 2002).                                                Through these
              | mechanisms, defaunation may lead to higher abundances of invertebrates, and thereby
              | higher rates of invertebrate seed predation.
              |        Few studies have investigated how defaunation indirectly alters invertebrate
              | seed predation rates. Consistent with expectation, bruchid beetle seed predation of
              | palms was higher in defaunated sites for every species investigated (Fig. 1.5).
              | However, in most cases, the absolute increase in invertebrate seed predation rates only
              | partially compensated for the decreases in vertebrate seed predation (Wright et al.
              | 2000, Wright & Duber 2001, but see Galetti et al. 2006).

text          | Few observational studies have evaluated differences in herbivory or trampling as a
              | consequence of defaunation.         Dirzo & Miranda (1991) an absence of vertebrate

              | to seedlings. Authors could define seedlings variously as first year germinants or by
              | size class. In about half of cases, recruitment was about 2-fold higher in defaunated
              | forests than in non-defaunated forests, both for seedlings and saplings (Fig. 1.6). In
              | the other half of cases, recruitment is lower in defaunated forests.
              |        There have been virtually no investigations into why recruitment rates change.
              | The variation in changes in recruitment do not seem to be consistently related to the
              | degree of defaunation across studies, loss of particular dispersers or loss of particular
              | seed predators. Changes in vertebrate seedling predation and herbivory, as well as
              | distance and density dependent mortality as mediated by invertebrate herbivores and
              | pathogens (Janzen 1970, Connell 1971), can be responsible for altered seedling
              | recruitment. However, no studies have recorded herbivory rates or causes of plant
              | mortality, so no definitive data exists on how each of these mechanisms contribute to
              | the changes in recruitment observed. One study of Syagrus found that sapling
              | recruitment near the parent tree was slightly lower in defaunated forests, while
              | recruitment far from the parent tree was more than 2-fold higher in defaunated forests
              | (Alves-Costa 2004). This may be because non-vertebrate natural enemies are more
              | than compensating for the loss of vertebrate herbivores near the parent trees, but not at
              | far distances, for this species. However, no data exist with which to evaluate this
              | explanation.
              |        It is also possible, in some cases, that differences in recruitment are not
              | actually due to defaunation.     In some studies of seedling recruitment, only one
              | defaunated site and one non-defaunated site were compared.              This opens the
              | possibility that some differences in recruitment were due to other environmental
              | factors that vary across the landscape, such as precipitation or edaphic conditions. The

              | in seedling survival could vary among species within the same study system. Survival
              | was lowest on highly defaunated islands in Lake Gatun, Panama for two of the three
              | species tested. Exclosure experiments verified that spiny rats, free of competition
              | from larger mammals, reach population sizes 10-fold greater on these islands relative
              | to the non-that sites (Adler 1996), and are responsible for the increased mortality. The

              | Lake Gatun region of central Panama. In one case, the defaunated site was hunted
              | relative to the non-defaunated site, but the animal community was not so impoverished
              | as to lead to a competitive release of small rodents. In that study, G. superba had

              | islands with only high populations of spiny rats present, survival of G. superba was
              | lower in the defaunated site. This difference in the degree of defaunation intensity
              | evaluated in the two studies, and compensatory changes in abundance of non-hunted
              | species, are likely to account for the contrasting responses in seedling survival, and

text          | (Babweteera et al. 2007). Meanwhile, species that are bird dispersed have lower
              | abundances in non-defaunated sites.
              |        These data suggest, for species which are rodent dispersed and predated, any
              | increases in distance-dependent or density-dependent mortality by invertebrates or
              | pathogens, as a consequence of reduced dispersal, do not compensate for reductions in
              | vertebrate seed and seedling predation, resulting in a net increase in survival for these
              | species. The same does not appear to be true for bird dispersed species, although there
              | is no theoretical reason why these species should not experience high reductions in
              | vertebrate seed predation.
              |        All studies involving rodent dispersed species were conducted on palm species,
              | most of which are preferred food species for agoutis, a dominant Neotropical seed
              | predator. More studies in Neotropical forests are required to determine if these
              | species are unique in experiencing a net benefit from defaunation, or if other species
              | preyed upon by agoutis also increase in abundance in defaunated sites. These studies
              | should include species that have birds or primates as their primary dispersal agents.
              |        In contrast to the rodent-dispersed palms, little is known about the seed
              | predators of the bird-dispersed species studied. However, at least two of the three
              | studies of bird-dispersed species were conducted in Paleotropical forests with different
              | assemblages of seed predators. Studies of vertebrate seed and seedling predation in
              | the Paleotropics may determine whether differences observed between rodent-
              | dispersed species and bird-dispersed species may be due to differences in the seed and
              | seedling predator community, rather than differences between species with different
              | dispersal agents per se.

text          | LINKING   DISPERSAL AND SEEDLING RECRUITMENT              It is clear, by several measures,
              | that seed dispersal decreases as a consequence of defaunation (Figs. 1.1 & 1.3), though
              | effects on seed caching are variable (Fig. 1.2). What is less clear is whether decreased
              | dispersal translates to decreases in plant recruitment.           Investigators focusing on
              | decreased seed dispersal as a consequence of defaunation often suggest that decreased
              | dispersal will result in decreases in seed and seedling survival and plant recruitment.
              | This is because undispersed seeds are assumed to be unable to escape distance-
              | dependent and/or density-dependent mortality (Janzen 1970, Connell 1971).
              |        However, there are several problems with this assumption. First, there are
              | many species for which distance- and/or density-dependent mortality have not been
              | detected (Hyatt et al. 2003, Uriarte et al. 2005). Secondly, spatial data on seedling
              | densities also show that reduced seed dispersal does not generally lead to great
              | decreases in seedling abundances under parent trees in defaunated forests (Fig. 1.3).
              | This suggests that though seed and seedling mortality may be higher under parent
meta          |                                                                                     23

text          | trees, the higher number of seeds that fall below the parent tree in defaunated forests
              | compensate for this higher mortality and seedling densities under parent trees remain
              | relatively similar to those observed in non-defaunated forests. Finally, as seen above,
              | vertebrate seed and seedling predation rates may also vary with defaunation (Figs. 1.4
              | & 1.5). Seedling density data suggest that reduced rates of vertebrate seed predation
              | result in increased survival rates that more than compensate for any increases in
              | distance-dependent or density-dependent mortality by non-vertebrates, at least for
              | rodent-dispersed species and species like B. wilsoniana (Fig. 1.6). Taken together,
              | these data suggest that the assumed negative effects of reduced seed dispersal on plant
              | recruitment as a consequence of hunting may not be general, but rather manifest
              | themselves only in species which (1) experience strong natural enemy-mediated,
              | negative density-dependent mortality (2) rely exclusively upon a few, large-bodied,
              | hunted vertebrates for seed dispersal, and (3) do not experience a demographic benefit
              | of reduced seed predation by rodents with increasing defaunation intensity.
              |        Interestingly, there are few studies that actually investigate changes in
              | dispersal and seedling recruitment simultaneously in a single species. In the case of
              | the large seeded palm Attalea butyracea in Central Panama, seed dispersal is reduced
              | in defaunated forests (Wright & Duber 2001). In addition, the intensity of bruchid
              | beetle seed predation does increase with proximity to the parent tree, and the effect
              | intensifies with defaunation. However, increased bruchid beetle seed predation did
              | not fully compensate for the decrease in vertebrate seed predation associated with the
              | defaunation, and seedling densities of the palm were higher in defaunated sites,
              | despite the decrease in seed dispersal.
              |        Brodie et al. (2009) modeled the effects of decreased dispersal on seedling
              | recruitment for Choerospondias axillaris in Thailand and did find evidence that
              | decreased dispersal would translate to decreased recruitment in this species. However
              | this was because defaunation deprived C. axillaris of favorable regeneration sites,
              | since C. axillaris seems to depend on light gaps for regeneration and could not
              | disperse to gaps without its vertebrate disperser (Brodie et al. 2009). It was not a
              | consequence of distance-dependent or density-dependent mortality.

              | defaunation due to hunting and fragmentation (Dirzo & Miranda 1991) completely
              | eliminate vertebrate herbivory (Fig. 1.9).               Interestingly, at many moderately
              | defaunated sites, community seedling densities are lower, relative to non-defaunated
              | sites.   It may be that terrestrial herbivores initially increase in abundance as a

              | appears to increase species dominance as well (Fig. 1.10b). Diversity indices appear
              | to mask the changes in community composition that occur in exclosure experiments,
              | because the effects of increased species richness and increased dominance tend to

              | diversity.
              |         In forest comparisons, species richness was generally lower. Unlike short-term
              | exclosure experiments, defaunated forests have experienced decades of defaunation,
              | likely allowing competitively dominant plant species to outcompete rarer and less
              | dominant species, reducing diversity.       Consistent with this hypothesis, species
              | dominance was higher in the cases that reported it (Fig. 1.10b). Responses in diversity
              | indices were mixed (Fig. 1.10c), again suggesting that these indices may be less

text          |           The studies found important differences in community seed mass responses.
              | In Peru, the relative abundance of large seeded species was lower in defaunated sites,
              | while in Panama, the community mean seed mass was higher in defaunated sites
              | (Wright et al. 2007, Nuñez-Iturri et al. 2008). The discrepancy appears to be due to
              | differences in faunal communities between Peru and Panama. In the Peruvian study,
              | defaunation greatly reduces populations of large primate dispersers, while not greatly
              | affecting the relatively low populations of seed predators such as agoutis. In contrast,
              | defaunation in Panama, defaunation greatly reduces agouti populations, but does not
              | greatly affect seed dispersal by large primates, as these animals are rare or absent even
              | in the non-defaunated sites.
              |           Studies of the effects of defaunation effects on other functional traits are rare.

              | 100 cm) in the exclosure experiment did have lower community mean leaf toughness,
              | and higher community mean leaf nitrogen relative to controls (Ch. 3). Wood density
              | was the only functional trait that had different responses to defaunation in the forest

text          | WHAT IS DEFAUNATION?
              | The heterogeneity in response to defaunation, particularly at the level of plant
              | population dynamics and community composition, suggest that more precision is
              | needed in characterizing exactly what is meant by defaunation, including its drivers
              | and the effects on the particular mammal community being studied. Among the
              | studies reported there, there was variation in the levels of defaunation in both “non-
              | defaunated” and “defaunated” forests across studies. In some cases, sites with similar
              | species compositions would be considered “non-defaunated” in one study, and
              | “defaunated” in another.
              |        Unfortunately, terms such as “hunted”, “fragmented,” or “disturbed” are
              | usually used to classify sites into treatments, but do not correspond to a specific
              | change in a vertebrate community. This problem could be addressed by reporting a
              | robust characterization of the vertebrate community. Often, studies did not actually
              | report differences in either abundances of key species (e.g. a particular seed disperser)
              | or the vertebrate community as a whole.      In other cases, the presence or absence of
              | species were reported, but not animal abundances. Reporting presence/absence data
              | will not capture situations in which animals such as rodents or smaller primates
              | actually increase in population size as defaunation reduces the predation and
              | competition they experience. In other cases, a species may be present, but in such rare
              | numbers so as to be functionally extinct.
              |        Though estimating animal abundances is labor-intensive, we suggest that

text          | Understanding the heterogeneity and sources of potential bias in the studies examined
              | here is important both for understanding the limitations and generality of the data, as
              | well as identifying areas for further research. Research on effects of defaunation on
              | plants has predominantly focused on Neotropical mammals.           Over 70 percent of
              | studies were conducted in the Neotropics, while only 15 percent and 10 percent of
              | studies were conducted in Africa and Asia respectively, with the remaining 5 percent
              | conducted in Australia and Polynesia. As this review has demonstrated, responses to
              | defaunation can be quite variable even within the Neotropics, where faunal
              | communities are relatively similar. More studies in the Paleotropics are needed to
              | understand how plant responses to defaunation in these forests may differ from those
              | observed in Neotropical forests.
              |        Only 15 percent of studies reported effects of avian defaunation, with the
              | remainder examining effects of mammalian defaunation.          Many of those studies
              | focused on rodents and/or primates.       Despite the fact that many of the larger
              | vertebrates such as peccaries, pigs, deer, tapir and elephants are most vulnerable to
              | defaunation, only a few studies investigated the effects of losing these animals from
              | the community.     Future studies should seek to understand the impacts of losing
              | relatively understudied groups of vertebrates, as well as understanding how losses of
              | dispersers, seed predators, and herbivores may synergize.
              |        It is also important to note that forest comparisons generally had low
              | replication. The majority of studies only had one non-defaunated site, and sometimes
              | only one defaunated site. We suggest that a better understanding of patterns and
              | mechanisms could come from increasing the number of study sites examined, and
              | including a range of defaunation intensities within a single study, with better
              | quantification of the differences in vertebrate communities. We suspect that many of

text          | Defaunation alters interactions between plants and their seed dispersers and predators,
              | and is sometimes associated with decreased diversity at the community level. A more
              | cryptic plant response to defaunation is an altered distribution of life histories and
              | functional traits in the community. In this study, we censused 12,769 seedlings in a
              | long-term terrestrial mammal exclosure experiment (LTEE) in Central Panama to
              | examine how vertebrate seed dispersers and seed predators shape relative abundances
              | of species classified by dispersal mode, growth forms, seed mass, leaf mass per area
              | (LMA), leaf toughness, and wood density. We then compared exclosure results with
              | data from a natural comparison of 38,250 seedlings in nearby hunted and unhunted
              | sites. The exclosure experiment excludes terrestrial seed predators and herbivores but
              | not seed dispersers such as primates, birds, and bats. In contrast, the hunting

text          | comparison reduces the abundance of all three groups. We tested the hypotheses that
              | (1) where seed dispersal is disrupted, species with unhunted dispersal modes, and
              | lianas, which are abiotically dispersed, are favored, (2) where seed predation is
              | reduced, larger-seed plant species are favored, and (3) where herbivory is reduced,
              | species with lower LMA, leaf toughness, and wood density are favored. Consistent
              | with our expectations, dispersal-driven changes in the relative abundance of growth
              | forms or dispersal mode classes were not observed in the terrestrial mammal exclosure
              | experiment, while higher median seed mass as a consequence of reduced seed
              | predation was observed. In contrast to our hypothesis, leaf functional traits did not
              | differ as a consequence of defaunation either in the forest comparison or in the LTEE.
              | Interestingly, wood density responses differed between our two experiments. Species
              | dispersed by mammals and large birds had significantly higher mean wood density
              | than wind dispersed species, suggesting that seed dispersal, rather than seedling
              | herbivory, may mediate decreases in community median wood density in hunted
              | forests.

title         | Introduction
blank         | 
text          | Over-hunting has caused severe declines, and even local extirpations, of hunted
              | wildlife populations in tropical forests throughout Latin America (Peres & Palacios
              | 2007), Africa (Fa & Brown 2009), and Asia (Corlett 2007). Defaunation perturbs
              | plant interactions with the frugivores, granivores, and herbivores that play critical
              | roles in establishing the composition and spatial distribution of seedlings in tropical
              | forest seedling banks. Reduced seed dispersal in hunted forests results in higher
              | proportions of undispersed seeds under parent trees of species reliant on hunted biotic
              | dispersal agents (Wright & Duber 2001, Cordiero & Howe 2003, Babweteera et al
              | 2007, Sethi & Howe 2009). Vertebrate seed predation rates may increase or decrease,
              | depending on the severity of defaunation and the size of the seeds and seed predators
              | affected (Guariguata et al. 2000, Galetti et al. 2006, Dirzo et al. 2007). Vertebrate
              | herbivory rates can also be drastically reduced (Dirzo and Miranda 1991). The net
              | effect of these perturbations can be the loss of plant diversity (Dirzo and Miranda
meta          |                                                                                      37

text          | 1991, Chapman & Onderdonk 1998), with up to 66% of species failing to recruit in the
              | most extreme case documented.
              |        Other important changes may also be occurring in the plant community even if
              | species richness is unaffected. Species with hunted dispersal agents, such as primates
              | or large birds, consistently decrease in abundance in hunted forests, while species with
              | abiotic or unhunted dispersal agents increase (Wright et al. 2007b, Nuñez-Iturri et al.
              | 2008, Terborgh et al. 2008). Lianas, the majority of which are abiotically dispersed in
              | this forest (Hardesty & Muller-Landau 2005), also increase in abundance in hunted
              | sites (Wright et al. 2007b). Where dispersal of large, primate-dispersed seeds is
              | disrupted by local extirpation of ateline monkeys, the relative abundance of those plant
              | species is lower than in sites where ateline monkeys are present (Nuñez-Iturri et al.
              | 2008). In sites where hunting decreases rodent seed predator populations, the median
              | seed mass of the seedling community is higher than in unhunted sites (Wright et al.
              | 2007b).
              |        In this study, our first goal was to move beyond investigations of dispersal
              | mode classes and seed mass to examine the effect of defaunation on other functional
              | traits. Lower abundances of browsers and other seedling predators in hunted sites
              | should lead to reduced vertebrate herbivory and seedling predation. Leaf mass per
              | unit area (LMA), low leaf laminar toughness (hereafter referred to as “toughness”),
              | and wood density are correlated with palatability to vertebrates or seedling survival
              | (Wardle et al. 2002, Alvarez-Clare & Kitajima 2007). We hypothesized that species
              | with low leaf area per unit mass, low leaf laminar toughness, and lower wood density
              | should be favored in hunted sites.
              |        A weakness of many forest comparison studies in defaunation work is that they
              | lack replication of hunted and unhunted forests. Even when there is replication,
              | differences in climate, soils, forest age, fragmentation or other anthropogenic factors
              | may covary with hunting intensity in comparative studies, making it difficult to
              | attribute the patterns observed to hunting alone. Therefore, a second goal of this study
              | was to validate results from forest comparisons with data from a long-term exclosure
              | experiment (LTEE). We conducted this study in Central Panama, where a hunting

text          | defaunation gradient has been previously documented (Wright et al. 2007b). Within
              | the unhunted, protected sites, a terrestrial mammal exclosure experiment has been
              | ongoing for the past fifteen years (Royo & Carson 2005).
              |        Because hunting typically disrupts multiple plant-animal interactions
              | simultaneously, it can be difficult to determine the relative influence of lost seed
              | dispersers, seed predators, or herbivores on resulting seedling communities in
              | comparative studies. A third goal of this study was to improve the extent to which
              | changes in the seedling community could be attributed to changes in particular
              | interactions. Unlike the hunted forest comparison, our LTEE excludes terrestrial seed
              | predators and herbivores from exclosure plots, but does not alter the abundance of
              | primary dispersal agents such as primates and most large birds. By comparing results
              | between the forest comparison and exclosure approaches, we can identify which
              | changes in the seedling community are due to changes in seed dispersal and which are
              | due to changes in seed or seedling predation. .
              |        We predicted that seedling communities in exclosures would have higher
              | median seed massas a consequence of lower seed predation, consistent with the forest
              | comparison (Wright et al. 2007). In contrast to the forest comparison experiment, we
              | predicted the LTEE would not show differences in the relative abundances of dispersal
              | mode classes or growth forms. We expected that median LMA, toughness and wood
              | density would be lower in exclosure plots relative to paired plots open to terrestrial
              | mammals, and in hunted forests relative to unhunted forests, as a consequence of
              | reduced herbivory.

              | and mainland peninsulas located in Lake Gatun in the Republic of Panama. Because
              | of forest guard patrol and researcher presence, activity of poachers is virtually
              | nonexistent on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) itself and is highly reduced on Gigante

text          | Exclosure experimental design.      Between late-1993 and mid-1994, eight pairs of
              | fenced, exclosure plots and open, control plots were established within the BCNM
              | (Royo & Carson 2005). Paired fenced and unfenced plots are 30 m x 45 m and are
              | approximately 5 m apart.       Exclosure fences are constructed of 12.7 x 12.7 cm
              | galvanized steel fencing 2.2 m tall and buried 0.25 m deep. A secondary 1.3 x 1.3 cm
              | mesh surrounds the lower 70 cm and also extends 0.25 m below ground. Twenty-
              | eight 0.5 x 0.5 m subplots were established in each of the 16 plots in a stratified
              | random fashion to census seedlings.        To avoid fence effects, no subplots were
              | established within a 5-7 m buffer zone of a plot edge. Within each subplot, each plant
              | less than 50 cm in height was tagged, measured, and identified. Seedling census data
              | were collected in 2006.

text          | Exclosure effectiveness. To assess differences in the animal communities between
              | open and exclosure treatments, Reconyx RC-55 infrared cameras (Reconyx, Inc.,
              | Holmen, WI) were used to monitor mammal activity in the 16 plots between August
              | and October 2008. Each plot was monitored at 6-7 locations, for a total of 41 camera
              | trap days per plot. A camera trigger was counted as a new “visit” if (1) it was a
              | different species than the prior trigger, or (2) if 60 minutes had elapsed between
              | triggers (Di Bitetti et al. 2008). We chose this method of quantification because
              | unmarked individuals of most mammals in this community cannot be distinguished by
              | photograph, and because this measure of activity likely describes animal impact on
              | each plot more accurately than abundance. Because it was difficult to accurately
              | count individuals for social animals such as peccaries (Tayassu tajacu) and coatis
              | (Nasua narica), activity by these species was analyzed as the number of visits by
              | social groups rather than visits by individuals.

              | Between June and December 2004, all woody plants less than 50 cm tall in an 8 x 8 m
              | subplot were censused by Wright et al. (2007b). Seedling plots were at the center of

              | between adult and seedling censuses. A total of 38250 individuals comprising 312

text          | Plant traits. Wright et al. (2010) determined life history traits, dry seed mass, leaf
              | mass per area (LMA), laminar toughness, and wood density for species in central
              | Panama. In this study, dry seed mass was measured as endosperm plus embryo mass
              | after oven drying to constant mass at 60ºC. Leaf mass per unit area was measured on
              | shade leaves as the mass of a standard-sized leaf disc after oven drying to constant
              | mass at 60ºC divided by the area of the disc. Laminar toughness was measured as the
              | force necessary to cut across a leaf, perpendicular to the midvein (Lucas et al. 2000).
              | Wood specific gravity, or mass after drying at 100ºC per unit volume, was used as the
              | unit of wood density. Data on dispersal agents have been assembled from published

text          | EXCLOSURE     EFFECTIVENESS.                   Fenced plots excluded non-climbing, terrestrial
              | granivores and herbivores from exclosures, including agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata),
              | paca (Agouti paca), deer (Mazama Americana and Odocoileus virginianus), and
              | peccaries (T. tajacu) (Fig. 1). Most climbing animals appeared to be undeterred by the
              | exclosure treatment.           Spiny rats (Proechimys steerei) showed higher activity in
              | exclosures than controls, perhaps responding to a lack of competition for food, greater
              | cover, or a reduction in ocelet abundance (Felis pardalis) in the exclosures. Most
              | birds were not affected by the exclosures, a notable exception being tinamous, which
              | are seed predators (Erand et al. 1991).

              | seedling predators in a way analogous to seed predators. A reduction in vertebrate

              | stems (73.3 %) in the hunting experiment. Stem tissue density is strongly positively
              | correlated with seedling survival in this forest (Alvarez-Clare & Kitajima 2007). If
              | greater stem tissue densities confer a protective effect against herbivores, we would
              | expect higher wood density species to be favored in open plots relative to exclosures,
              | and protected sites relative to hunted sites. Median wood densities were greatly
              | reduced in hunted site seedling communities, relative to both protected site seedling
              | communities (pooled variance t=3.86, P = 0.0011, one-tailed test) (Fig. 5a), and their

text          | This study demonstrates that hunting effects change in the seedling community of
              | tropical forests primarily by perturbing biotic seed dispersal and vertebrate seed
              | predation. Increases in lianas and reductions in species with hunted biotic dispersal
              | agents were observed in the hunting experiment, where primary dispersers were
              | reduced (Wright et al. 2007b), but not in the LTEE, where primary dispersers were not
              | manipulated (Figs. 2 and 3). Activity of seed predators was dramatically reduced in
              | the LTEE, and here we observed increases in median seed mass (Fig. 4). This result is

text          | consistent with larger-seed species experiencing an escape from vertebrate seed
              | predation (Dirzo et al., 2007), and lends strong support to the view that changes in
              | seed predator abundance are responsible for the increases in median seed mass
              | observed in hunted forests relative to protected forests (Wright et al. 2007b).
              |        Leaf traits showed no differences in both the LTEE and the hunting
              | experiment. This suggests that the reduction of vertebrate herbivores by hunting does
              | not have a strong impact on changes in seedling community composition at early
              | stages of plant recruitment.
              |                Wood density responses to herbivore reduction differed between the
              | LTEE and hunting experiment. The likeliest explanation for the discrepancy is that, as
              | with differences in dispersal mode and growth form responses between our
              | experiments, differences in wood density responses are dispersal-driven. To test this
              | post hoc hypothesis, we evaluated whether dispersal mode classes differ in their mean
              | wood densities. Consistent with our hypothesis that experimental differences in wood
              | density responses are due to differences in dispersal, wood density was significantly
              | lower for species with unhunted dispersal agents than for species having either hunted
              | dispersal agents, or a combination of the two (Fig. 6).
              |        In contrast to the hunting experiment, the LTEE shows higher spiny rat activity
              | in the defaunated treatment. As spiny rats are known to be significant seedling
              | predators in the absence of other competitors (Asquith et al. 1997), it is also possible
              | that they may be compensating for the reduction in other seedling predators inside the
              | exclosures. However several lines of evidence contradict this putative explanation.
              |        First, if spiny rats were compensating for other herbivores inside the exclosure
              | as in the study of Asquith et al. (1997), we would expect overall seedling densities to
              | be similar in open and exclosure plots, but instead, seedling densities in exclosures are
              | about 2-fold higher than in open plots (data not shown). The herbivory study on
              | islands which indicated that spiny rats alone can achieve seedling predation rates as
              | high as communities with relatively intact mammal fauna were conducted on islands
              | in which spiny rat densities are among the highest rodent densities ever documented
              | (Adler 1996), but our study does not replicate these high densities. In addition,

text          |        Our evidence for a link between seed dispersal and community wood density is
              | an interesting result because Brodie and Gibbs (2009) recently proposed that
              | reductions in seed dispersal as a consequence of defaunation may result in shifts in
              | mean wood density at the community level.           However, the mechanism that they
              | proposed assumed that seed mass was positively correlated with wood density across
              | species in tropical forests, which is true neither generally, nor for our site specifically
              | (Wright et al. 2010).      Here we show that dispersal likely mediates changes in
              | community wood density distributions via an alternative mechanism, namely that low
              | and high wood density plant species are disportionately associated with dispersal
              | mode agents that are favored and disfavored respectively by hunting.

              | 
text          |        Our results suggest that there may be important links between hunting,
              | frugivore abundance, and the ability of future tropical forests to sequester carbon.
              | Disruption of seed dispersal by game animals has the potential to alter the ability of
              | forests to store carbon by (1) decreasing the abundance of trees relative to lianas
              | (Wright et al. 2007b), and (2) shifting wood density distributions in the community
              | toward lower wood density species (Fig 5a).
              |        Higher liana relative abundance may reduce carbon storage at the ecosystem
              | level in two ways. Lianas compete with trees for light, displace tree leaf mass (Kira &
              | Ogawa 1971), and lower tree growth.         One recent study from Amazonia estimated
              | that above ground competition from lianas was responsible for reductions in tree
              | growth that reduced carbon sequestration by the equivalent of 0.25 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (van
              | der Heijden & Phillips, 2009). Growth of the lianas themselves amounted to 0.07 Mg
              | C ha-1 yr-1, which did not compensate for reductions in tree growth. The authors

              | 
              | 
text          | therefore estimated that competition from lianas reduced carbon sequestration at the
              | ecosystem level by net amount of 0.18 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 or 71%.
              |        The consequences of lowering community mean wood density for carbon
              | storage depend on the relationship between wood density and tree volume in a
              | particular forest. Three Panamanian forests in the region, including BCI, exhibit a
              | weak, but negative relationship between plot mean wood density and plot biomass
              | (Stegen et al. 2009). This suggests that the reduction in community wood density in
              | our study site may actually lead to higher forest biomass, and partially compensate for
              | any reduction resulting from the relative reduction in free-standing stems. However,
              | forests exhibiting positive wood density-biomass relationships could experience a
              | decrease in carbon sequestration potential under the same scenario of reduced plot
              | wood density.
              |        The phenomenon of over-hunting in tropical forests is widespread and severe.
              | If the changes in carbon storage potential represented by shifting seedling
              | communities in this study are as wide-spread as over-hunting itself, the potential
              | impact may be great. However, many questions must be answered before we can
              | understand the magnitude of the impact that hunting may have on the ability of
              | tropical forests to sequester carbon.
              |        First, to our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that tropical tree
              | wood densities are associated with dispersal mode classes, and in a way that would
              | respond to hunting. Studies investigating the generality of this association would
              | represent the first step in predicting whether the changes observed in our site would
              | apply pan-tropically. Secondly, here we report changes in the seedling community,
              | but better models of forest dynamics are needed to understand the extent to which
              | those changes will propagate to the adult community. Third, how lianas alter carbon
              | storage at the ecosystem level is poorly understood, and in particular we do not
              | understand how liana competition with trees varies as a function of liana abundance.
              | Finally, as noted by Stegen et al. (2009), there are many unanswered questions
              | pertaining to how changes in wood density distributions translate to changes in
              | biomass at the plot level.

text          |            Hunting is not the only cause of defaunation. Frugivores, granivores, and
              | herbivores may also decrease in abundance as a result of habitat fragmentation and
              | loss (Asquith et al. 1999, Galetti et al. 2006, Terborgh et al. 2006, Cramer et al.
              | 2007).      As with hunting, decreases in abundance with intensity of habitat loss
              | disproportionately affect larger-bodied animals. Therefore, even in the absence of
              | hunting, other sources of defaunation may be expected to have similar indirect effects
              | on plant community functional trait composition and ecosystem services in tropical

text          | Mammalian herbivores are known to be important regulators of plant community
              | composition in tropical savannas and temperate systems. However, their impact on
              | tropical communities beyond their impact as seedling predators has remained largely
              | unexplored, perhaps because of the assumed importance of insect herbivory for
              | tropical plants beyond the seedling stage. In this study, we censused 35,069 saplings
              | in a long-term terrestrial mammal exclosure experiment in Central Panama to
              | determine whether mammalian herbivores had the ability to regulate the abundances
              | of species differing in wood density, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf toughness, and leaf
              | nitrogen. We found that community mean leaf toughness decreased in exclosures over
              | time, while community mean leaf nitrogen increased.           These differences were
              | primarily due to an increased abundance of species possessing favored traits, rather
              | than species turnover as a consequence of herbivore exclusion. No community-level
              | differences were observed for mean wood density or specific leaf area. We also found

title         | INTRODUCTION

text          | Mammalian herbivores are known to be important top-down regulators of plant
              | community composition in many ecosystems (Olff & Ritchie 1998, Parker et al.
              | 2006). In tropical forests, mammals are recognized as significant seedling predators
              | (Barone and Coley 1996). However their importance as herbivores in later stages of
              | plant recruitment has been less studied.
              |        One study in peninsular Malaysia found that native pigs (Sus scrofa) uproot or
              | snap 500 saplings per female pig in their reproductive nest building (Ickes et al. 2001).
              | Experimental exclusion of pigs resulted in sapling density increasing by 32 percent,
              | relative to open controls in just two years (Ickes et al. 2001). Lizcano (2006) excluded
              | large mammalian herbivores, including mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque) and
              | brocket deer (Mazama spp.), in montane tropical forests in Columbia and discovered a
              | 2-fold increase in understory plant biomass in two years.
              |        These two studies found higher species richness in exclosures, as may be
              | expected with higher stem densities, but no differences in species diversity indices.
              | The discrepancy between species richness and species diversity indices is explained by
              | the fact that species dominance often increases in mammal exclosures as well. The
              | positive and negative influences of increased species richness and dominance
              | respectively on the diversity index of an exclosure community can cancel each other
              | out, leading to the diversity index of an exclosure community being similar to that of a
              | control community.
              |        In other ecosystems, herbivore exclosure not only results in changes in plant
              | density and diversity, but also in plant functional trait composition. This is because,
              | although mammals are generalist herbivores relative to many insects, they still exhibit
              | diet preferences. In one temperate forest, browsers selected species lower in defense
meta          |                                                                                        53

              | and in a sub-humid grassland, grazers preferred taller-growing species (Diaz et al.
              | 2001).
              |          However, at the community level, evolutionary history and present day
              | intensity of herbivory interact with diet preferences to produce mixed effects on
              | functional trait composition.      In cases where species have evolved naïve of
              | mammalian herbivores, introduced browsers change species composition in favor of
              | species with lower average tissue quality (Wardle et al. 2002). The same occurs in
              | intensely grazed grasslands (Chaneton et al. 1988). In cases where plant communities
              | have evolved with mammalian herbivores, herbivory results in communities of species
              | with higher average tissue quality, both in the presence of native herbivores
              | (McNaughton 1985), as well as domestic herbivores that are not grazing at intensive
              | levels (Cingolani et al. 2002).
              |          In contrast to other ecosystems, mammals in tropical forests are perceived to
              | be relatively unimportant herbivores. Mammals are responsible for about one quarter
              | of all herbivory in tropical forests. As generalists, they are perceived to have less of a
              | selective influence in shaping plant community composition and plant anti-herbivore
              | defense than specialist invertebrate herbivores (Coley and Barone 2003). However,
              | tropical forest mammals are important seedling predators. Therefore, the primary aim
              | of this study was to test whether mammalian herbivores could indeed have effects on
              | plant functional trait composition in tropical forests similar to those seen in temperate
              | forests by influencing the composition of the younger cohorts of the plant community.
              |          We conducted this study in the Barro Colorado National Monument in central
              | Panama, where a terrestrial mammal exclosure experiment has been ongoing for the
              | past fifteen years (Royo & Carson 2005). We predicted that if mammalian herbivores
              | were important for determining sapling functional trait distributions, exclosure would
              | favor species that are faster growing (typically species with low wood density and
              | high specific leaf area, or SLA), less defended (low leaf toughness) and which have
              | higher nutrient leaves (higher leaf nitrogen). Our second goal was to evaluate the
              | hypothesis that differences in traits between treatments developed both as a

text          | consequence of species turnover as well as increases in abundance of favored species
              | already common to both treatments.
              |        A final goal of this study was to examine whether the traits of the species
              | themselves changed intraspecifically with mammal exclusion. In temperate systems,
              | changes in mammalian herbivory induce changes in photosynthetic rates (Oleksyn et
              | al. 1998, Nabeshima et al. 2001), photosynthetic efficiency (Retuerto et al. 2004), leaf
              | toughness (Shimazaki & Miyashita 2002). In tropical savanna, megaherbivores
              | influence the concentrations of condensed tannins in Acacia (Ward & Young 2002).
              | Though herbivory rates in tropical forests are much higher overall in comparison to
              | temperate forests (Coley & Barone 1996), suggesting that perhaps constitutive anti-
              | herbivore defenses should be ubiquitous. However, several tropical species alter their
              | defense in response to herbivory, and it has been suggested that the lack of more
              | tropical examples of plasticity in defense are due to lack of study rather than
              | biological differences between temperate and tropical plants (Karban & Baldwin
              | 1997). We therefore examined whether the defense trait we examined, leaf toughness,
              | may decrease intraspecifically in response to mammal exclusion.

              | moist forest. We conducted our experiment on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) and on
              | the Gigante Peninsula, within the Barro Colorado National Monument (BCNM). The
              | BCI has relatively high abundances of vertebrate herbivores affected by mammal
              | exclosure, compared to other Neotropical forests, including deer (Mazama Americana
              | and Odocoileus virginianus), collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu), agoutis (Dasyprocta
              | punctata), pacas (Agouti paca), rabbits (Silvilagus brasiliensis). This is due to a
              | combination of factors, including a lack of resident large felines on the island,
              | protection from poaching, and other environmental factors. Tapir (Tapirus bairdii) are
              | also present on BCI, but are rare.

text          | Exclosure experimental design. Between late-1993 and mid-1994, eight pairs of
              | fenced, exclosure plots and open, control plots were established within the BCNM
              | (Royo & Carson 2005). Four pairs of plots are on (BCI) and the remaining four pairs
              | are on the mainland Gigante Penninsula. Fenced and unfenced plots are 30 m x 45 m
              | and are approximately 5 m apart. Exclosure fences are constructed of 12.7 x 12.7 cm
              | galvanized steel fencing 2.2 m tall and buried 0.25 m deep. A secondary 1.3 x 1.3 cm
              | mesh surrounds the lower 70 cm and also extends 0.25 m below ground. A 5-7 m
              | buffer zone at the plot edge, and bisecting the plot, allowed for access and the
              | avoidance of fence effects. Exclosures excluded the species mentioned above, but did
              | not exclude climbing mammals such as squirrels and spiny rats, nor did they exclude
              | arboreal mammals such as monkeys (Fig. 2.1). Monitoring data suggest that birds
              | were not altered by the exclosures, with the possible exception of tinamous (Fig. 2.1).
              | Though tortoises occur on our study site and are likely to be excluded by the fences,
              | they are small and rare, and generally not considered to have an effect on our study

              | on shade leaves of saplings as the fresh lamina area divided by the mass of a whole
              | leaf with petiole after oven drying to constant mass at 60ºC (Cornelissen et al. 2003).

              | NA1500 elemental analyzer (Carlo Erba Instruments, Italy) for total N and C. Leaf
              | toughness was measured as the force necessary to punch a 3mm diameter hole the leaf
              | lamina with a force gauge, avoiding leaf veins to the extent possible (Sagers &Coley
              | 1995). Wright and colleagues (2007b) determined dry seed mass and adult tree wood

text          | Analyses. Trait correlations were conducted to assess whether traits in this study were
              | orthogonal to one another, and thus likely to respond independently to herbivory.
              | Community mean trait values were calculated in three ways. First, we calculated the
              | grand means of the traits at the species level, and used these species means to
              | determine the average trait value of the species occurring in each plot. We next
              | repeated this analysis, but weighted the species’ trait means by species’ abundances in
              | the plots. Finally, we calculated species trait means separately for exclosure and open
              | communities, and recalculated the abundance-weighted plot means using these
              | treatment-specific species trait values.
              |        Linear mixed models were used to evaluate whether changes in community
              | mean trait values over time differed between treatments. Exclosure and time were
              | treated as fixed factors and the exclosure-control pair were treated as a random factor
              | nested within time. Our experiment tested for an exclosure-time interaction, and
              | significance values reported here refer to that interaction. All analyses were conducted

text          | EFFECTS   OF   SPECIES OCCURRENCE In 1993, approximately 87 percent of species
              | occurring in the experiment were present in both treatments. In 2003, 75 percent of
              | species occurring in the experiment were present in both treatments. Therefore, when
              | we averaged the trait means of the species occurring in each plot, we observed that the
              | changes in plot trait means over time did not differ between treatments for any of the
              | traits measured (Fig. 3.1).

              | from 1994 to 2003, but did not increase in open plots (data not shown). When we
              | averaged the trait means of the species occurring in each plot, and weighted traits by

              | We predicted that exclosures would favor species with lower wood density, lower
              | SLA, lower leaf toughness, and higher leaf nitrogen. We did not see significant
              | differences between treatments in wood density (Fig. 3.2A) or SLA (Fig. 3.2B).

text          | Regulation of plant functional trait composition by mammalian herbivores
              | In this study, we demonstrate that terrestrial mammals influence understory functional
              | trait distributions in tropical forests. They do so primarily by suppressing populations
              | of species with traits that are correlated with high nutrition and low defense.
              | Consistent with our predictions that reduced herbivory should favor species with low
              | defense and high nutrient content, community mean leaf toughness decreased over
              | time in exclosures over time (Fig. 3.2C), and community mean leaf nitrogen increased
              | in exclosures over time (Fig 3.2D), while open control plots did not show equivalent
              | changes.
              |        Wood density is associated with seedling survival in the presence of herbivores
              | in this forest (Alvarez-Claire & Kitajima 2007, 2009). Browsers and grazers have also
              | been shown to select species with higher SLA in other systems (Wardle et al. 2002,
              | Cingolani et al. 2002).     However, neither of these traits changed in response to
              | mammal exclosure. This could be because, at the sapling stage in tropical forests, the
              | low light conditions of the forest understory also favor low SLA, high wood density
              | species and perhaps this environmental factor constrains the community response to
              | herbivory with respect to those traits.
              |        We did not find that changes in functional traits at the community-level were
              | the result of divergences in species presence-absence between exclosure and open
              | plots. The sapling community established prior to the imposition of the exclosure
              | treatments, and therefore two treatments started out with very similar communities.

              | 
text          | Over longer time scales, competitively dominant species may outcompete less
              | competitive species in the exclosure treatment, resulting in lower species richness,
              | particularly of species which are better defended but slower growing. However, we
              | did not observe decreases in species richness in the time-frame of this experiment
              | (data not shown).
              |        Seed and seedling predators are also excluded from the exclosure communities.
              | Therefore, it is reasonable to question whether the effects we observed are due
              | exclusively to herbivore exclusion. Two lines of evidence allow us to attribute our
              | results to herbivores. First, long-term studies of seedling growth in central Panama
              | suggest that all individuals in this size class established before the experimental
              | treatments were imposed (S.J. Wright, pers. comm.). Therefore, saplings in both
              | treatments should have been exposed to the same seed and seedling predation agents.
              |        Consistent with the assumption that saplings established prior to exclusion of
              | seed and seedling predators, community mean seed mass does not differ between
              | treatments for the sapling community (data not shown). This is in contrast to the
              | seedlings in the exclosure communities, which did establish under conditions of seed
              | and seedling predator exclusion, and as a result have higher community mean seed
              | mass than seedlings in open control communities (Fig. 2.4).
              |        These two lines of evidence suggest that exclusion of seed and seedling
              | predators are not responsible for the exclosure effects observed in the sapling
              | community, leaving only herbivory as a possible explanation.

title         | Intraspecific differences in leaf toughness
text          | The majority of species in the experiment showed lower mean leaf toughness inside
              | the exclosure, relative to open plots. When these intraspecific differences in species
              | leaf toughness were accounted for (Fig. 3.3), treatment differences in plot level leaf
              | toughness in 2003 were 66 percent larger than when a grand mean for the species leaf
              | toughness was applied (Fig. 3.2C). This result suggests that in the case of leaf
              | toughness, the trait values measured for juvenile tropical plants may vary with the
              | degree of herbivory experienced.

text          |        There are several possible explanations for the intraspecific divergence in leaf
              | toughness. First, it is possible that, within species, genotype or environment produces
              | variation in leaf toughness, and individuals with lower leaf toughness survive at a
              | lower rate in open plots than in exclosures . Support for this mechanism can be found
              | in studies of insect herbivory on plant genotypes which differ in their expression of
              | qualitative defense traits (Kessler & Baldwin, 2001, Silfer et al. 2009).
              |        An alternative explanation is that plants are relaxing their investment in
              | mechanical defenses when they no longer experience mammalian herbivory.
              | Hundreds of plant species are known to increase investment in defense when exposed
              | to herbivory, and subsequently attenuate that defense when herbivory levels are lower
              | (Karban & Baldwin 1997).           However few studies have documented reduced
              | investment in defense upon reduction of mammalian herbivory.                   In Acacia
              | drepanolobium decreases in spine length or spinescence are detectable after 22 months
              | (Young & Okello 1998), decreases in condensed tannin concentrations are detectable
              | after 24-36 months (Ward & Young 2002) and reduced investment in indirect defenses
              | occur within several years (Huntzinger et al. 2004).
              |        Regardless of the mechanism, the fact that mammalian herbivores may play a
              | role in altering leaf toughness intraspecifically in tropical plants is unexpected. Insects
              | are thought to be responsible for three quarters of herbivory in tropical forests, and
              | also the source of the strongest selection pressures plants receive to develop anti-
              | herbivore defenses in this system (Barone & Coley 2002). The experimental plots in
              | which we measured leaf toughness did not manipulate insects, and it is plausible that
              | plants in both treatments could have experience high rates of invertebrate herbivory,
              | and therefore shown no attenuation in defense traits.        Yet, it appears that insect
              | herbivores could not compensate for mammalian herbivores in maintaining high
              | intraspecific leaf toughness when mammals were excluded.

text          | result, these communities currently experience intense levels of herbivory, low rates of
              | plant recruitment and often decreases in species richness and diversity (Wardle et al.
              | 2002, Rooney 2001).        However, tropical forests are undergoing the opposite
              | perturbation. Throughout the tropics, mammalian herbivores are being unsustainably
              | hunted (Peres & Palacios 2007, Corlett 2007, Fa & Brown 2009). Preferred game
              | species of animals are often large-bodied herbivores, such as elephants, tapir, pigs,
              | peccaries and deer.
              |        Understanding how and why such perturbations in herbivore abundance alter
              | plant species diversity and functional composition will help conservation biologists
              | identify potential interventions to conserve plant species threatened indirectly by
              | defaunation.    However, because most studies examining changes in functional
              | diversity have been conducted in temperate forests, where the perturbation
              | experienced by plant communities is increased rates of herbivory, little empirical data
              | exists with which to evaluate how tropical forests may respond to decreased rates of
              | herbivory by native herbivores as a consequence of defaunation.
              |        The biomass of terrestrial mammalian herbivores in tropical forests is quite
              | low, relative to other ecosystems (Bodmer 1989, Leigh et al. 1982). In addition,
              | insects are thought to account for approximately 75 percent of overall herbivory in
              | tropical forests. Taken together, these data might suggest that observed reductions in
              | terrestrial mammalian herbivore populations in tropical forests may not have large
              | impacts on sapling community composition.           However, this study demonstrates
              | reduced herbivory as a consequence of tropical defaunation is likely to cause an
              | increase in dominance of sapling species with higher leaf nitrogen and lower leaf
              | toughness. Leaves with higher leaf nitrogen and lower concentrations of defense
              | compounds typically have higher decomposition rates. Therefore, it is conceivable
              | that if changes in the sapling community propagate to alter canopy composition,
              | defaunation may alter nutrient cycling in tropical forests.

text          | This study tested the hypothesis that vertebrate seed predation rates vary with seed
              | size and with hunting intensity in tropical forests, corresponding to direct impacts of
              | hunting on vertebrate species of differing size classes. Seed fate of seeds from species
              | with mean fresh seed masses ranging from 0.002 to 62.4 g was compared between a
              | protected and nearby hunted forest in central Panama. Transect survey data verified
              | that higher hunting intensity corresponded with lower abundances of key mammalian
              | seed predators. Seed arrays of a subset of species were monitored with camera traps
              | to verify the identities of animals responsible for seed removal. In this system, there
              | was only weak support for a relationship between seed predation rates and seed size,
              | and no evidence that this relationship changed at high hunting intensity. There was
              | also no evidence that seed predator body size varied with seed size, as agoutis
              | (Dasyprocta punctata) were responsible for most of the verified removal for five plant
              | species examined, ranging from 1.95 to 62.4 g in fresh seed mass.

text          | Overharvesting of bushmeat is a pervasive threat to biodiversity across the tropics (Fa
              | & Peres 2001, Peres & Palacios 2007, Corlett 2007). This defaunation not only
              | directly lowers vertebrate abundance in hunted forests, but initiates trophic cascades
              | which perturb the plant, insect, and pathogen communities as well. Preferred game
              | species of animals are usually large-bodied vertebrates, such as ateline monkeys, tapir,
              | peccary and deer, as well as large birds, and in some cases reptiles, in the context of
              | Neotropical forests. Understanding how and why such cascading perturbations alter
              | species diversity and functional composition in the plant community is important for
              | understanding the role mammals play in maintaining the diversity of tropical forests,
              | as well as identify potential interventions to conserve plant species threatened by the
              | negative indirect effects of defaunation.
              |        Several studies have documented reduced seed dispersal as a consequence of
              | hunting in tropical forests, particularly for larger-seed species (e.g. Wright et al. 2000,
              | Guariguata et al. 2000, Guariguata et al. 2002, Galetti et al. 2006, Wang et al. 2007,
              | Brodie et al. 2009, Fadini et al. 2009, Holbrook & Loiselle 2009). These studies
              | suggest that reduced dispersal should result in reduced recruitment of large-seeded
              | species, in particular those that rely on large-bodied mammals vulnerable to hunting
              | for their seed dispersal (Peres & van Roosmalen 2002, Nuñez-Iturri et al. 2008,
              | Terborgh et al. 2008).
              |        However, in most cases, reduced dispersal due to hunting has not been
              | explicitly linked to subsequent reductions in seedling recruitment. While one study
              | modeled the potential reduction in seedling recruitment, based on estimates of reduced
              | dispersal to and differential survival in different microhabitats (Brodie et al. 2009),
              | only one set of studies of which I am aware measured seed dispersal, seed predation,
              | and seedling recruitment for the same species in both protected and hunted sites
              | (Wright et al. 2000, Wright & Duber 2001). Wright and colleagues (2000, 2001)
              | focused on two large-seeded palm species, members of genera which are widespread
              | in the Neotropics. They found seed dispersal to be indeed reduced, and seedling
              | densities near parent trees to be higher, as one would predict to be associated with

              | literature, recruitment of Attalea and Astrocaryum palms was actually higher in the
              | hunted sites (Wright et al. 2000, 20001). The reason for this unexpected increase in
              | recruitment was that hunting reduced the intensity of vertebrate seed predation, and
              | this reduction was not fully compensated for by invertebrates.     (Cramer et al. 2003)
              | suggested a similar reduction in seed predation was responsible for higher recruitment
              | of the African species Balanites wilsoniana in defaunated sites, despite lower dispersal
              | by elephants, however seed predation rates were never measured (Babweteera et al.
              | 2007).
              |          It is clear from this example that a better understanding of the consequences of
              | hunting for seed predation is necessary for providing context to the studies
              | documenting reduced seed dispersal. In studies which have measured seed predation
              | in sites with differing intensities of hunting, rates of vertebrate seed predation have
              | often been lower in hunted sites (Terborgh & Wright 1994, Wright et al. 2000, Wright
              | & Duber 2001, Guariguata 2000, Beckman & Muller-Landau 2007, but see Roldán &
              | Simonetti 2001).
              |          Even less clear is how perturbations in seed predation rates as a consequence
              | of hunting may vary with seed size. Because larger-seeded species are expected to
              | disproportionately experience reduced seed dispersal, understanding how seed
              | predation changes with hunting across a range of seed sizes is important for
              | understanding whether or not the potentially negative demographic consequences of
              | reduced seed dispersal of larger-seeded species is intensified, maintained, or
              | compensated for by alterations in seed predation across species (Stoner et al. 2007).
              | However, most studies which have measured seed predation rates under various
              | hunting regimes have focused on one or two plant species (e.g. Terborgh & Wright
              | 1994, Wright et al. 2000, Roldán & Simonetti 2001, Wright & Duber 2001, Galetti et
              | al. 2006, Beckman & Muller-Landau 2007, Donatti et al. 2009). Due to the variation
              | in location, mammal community composition, and degree of defaunation in the sites
              | studied, these data cannot be directly compared to assess how seed predation rates
              | change with defaunation intensity as a function of seed size.           Guariguata and

text          | colleagues (2000) measured seed predation rates of seven species, but focused
              | primarily on small-seeded timber species. .
              |        In 2007, Dirzo and colleagues published a model of how vertebrate seed
              | predation could be expected to vary with seed size and intensity of vertebrate
              | defaunation in tropical forests (Fig. 4.1). At low levels of hunting, vulnerable, large-
              | bodied animals drastically decrease in abundance or become locally extirpated. In
              | response to this competitive release, as well as a likely reduction in predation by
              | felines, medium-sized seed predators initially become more abundant, until they
              | become the primary game species at moderate levels of hunting. At the highest
              | intensities of defaunation, even medium-sized seed predators have become rare. Small
              | rodents increase steadily with increasing hunting intensity, as they experience a
              | reduction in competition and predation.
              |        In this model, predation intensity of larger-seeded species mirrors the changes
              | in abundance of medium-bodied seed predators (e.g. 4-20 kg body mass in
              | Neotropical communities), while predation of smaller-seeded species increases as
              | small bodied seed predator (< 1 kg) biomass increases. As a result, the relative
              | proportion of larger and smaller seeds comprising the seedling bank is expected to
              | shift as defaunation intensity increases. This model was important for clarifying how
              | seed predation is likely to vary by seed-size, and how this relationship is dependent
              | upon the defaunation context.

text          |        With this study, I aimed to test several assumptions and hypotheses inherent in
              | this model. The first assumption I tested was that larger-seeded species experience
              | higher seed predation intensity than smaller seeded species at all but the highest levels
              | of defaunation intensity. The second assumption of the model I tested was that larger-
              | seeded species tend to be consumed by large- and medium-bodied vertebrates.
              | Likewise, smaller-seeded species tend to be consumed by smaller-bodied vertebrates.
              | A third hypothesis implicit in the model is that at high levels of defaunation intensity,
              | where the number of large- and medium-bodied vertebrates is highly reduced, larger-
              | seeded species experience reduced seed predation, relative to less defaunated sites. A

text          | fourth prediction of the model is that smaller-seeded species experience increased seed
              | predation as defaunation intensity increases, as populations of small bodied vertebrates
              | increase in response to competitive release and reduced predation. There is a great
              | interest in determining the extent to which other vertebrates or natural enemies can
              | compensate for the loss of a primary seed predator.
              |        To test these hypotheses, seeds of 13 species spanning the range of 0.002 to
              | 64.2 g mean fresh seed mass were monitored in arrays in both a protected forest and a
              | nearby hunted forest. Fate of seeds was monitored for four weeks. To           examine
              | whether larger- and smaller-seeded species indeed had larger- and smaller-bodied
              | seed predators respectively, the seed arrays on BCI were monitored with camera traps
              | for five species ranging from 1.95 to 64.2 g fresh mean seed mass for one week, and
              | the the agents of seed removal were recorded.
              |        To assess whether other vertebrates might compensate for the loss of a
              | principle seed predator, I monitored two large-seeded palm species with camera traps
              | in both sites. This allowed me to determine if and how the species of vertebrate seed
              | disperser differed between the protected and hunted sites, in particular if smaller
              | vertebrates compensated for the removal of larger vertebrates. I also recorded the
              | source of mortality for all species when seeds were killed by invertebrates and
              | pathogens, to examine whether those agents could also compensate for the loss of
              | larger bodied seed predators.

              | Terwilliger 1978, Milton & Hopkins 2005). However today, activity of poachers is
              | virtually nonexistent on BCI due to the monitoring by forest guards and Panamanian
              | police. The last confirmed incident of poaching on BCI occurred in 1989 (Wright et
              | al. 2007).   Consistent with an absence of poachers, researchers on BCI do not

              | which the study was conducted is not actively patrolled. This is due to both fewer
              | forest guards at the park, a lack of vehicles to access the study area, which is more
              | than 20 km from the park headquarters. Consistent with a lack of protection, various
              | evidence of hunting activity was encountered while conducting this study, including
              | spent shells, campfires, litter, gun shots, hunting dogs, experimental vandalism, and in
              | one case, encountering a hunting party.

text          | Seed preparation. Thirteen woody plant species ranging from 0.002 to 64.2 g mean
              | fresh seed mass were selected for this study (Table 4.1), representing 76 % of the
              | range in fresh seed mass for this area on a log scale. While these species are common
              | to both BCI and PNS, heavy insect and/or pathogen infestation of some species in
              | PNS prevented collection of viable seeds in this site. Because of protected area rules,
              | seeds could not be moved between sites. Therefore, eleven species were examined on
              | BCI and six species in PNS, with four species common to both sites, spanning almost
              | the entire range of seed size in the study.
              |           Seeds appearing rotten, insect-damaged, or otherwise unviable were not
              | included in the experiment. To remove confounding effects of differing seed pulps, all
              | seeds were cleaned of pulp or mucilage. After pulp removal, mass, width and length
              | were measured for seeds of all species but Apeiba tibourbou. Apeiba seed mass for
              | BCI was previously recorded (Wright et al. 2007). A thread was attached to all but
              | the smallest seeds (A. tibourbou and P. tenuifolium), so that I could recover the seeds
              | and record their fate.

text          | Seed predation experiment. A randomized block design was used to compare seed
              | predation rates in the two sites.    Within each forest, six blocks were delineated.
              | Within each block, each species was placed on the forest floor in an array of 6-8 seeds
              | in a different random location. For G. superba on BCI and C. tepelijote in PNS, only
              | four arrays were used, as few seeds unattacked by insects were available. Because A.
              | tibourbou and P. tenuifolium, were small and not marked with thread, these species
              | were set out in shallow mesh trays with 6-8 seeds per tray. Data reported here is from
              | a total of 732 seeds.
              |        Experiments were conducted between mid-July and mid-September 2009.
              | Seeds were monitored for four weeks, during which seed fate and agent of mortality
              | were recorded. Classes of seed fate were: unmoved (intact), cached, moved but not
              | buried (intact), predated by vertebrates, predated by insects, and killed by pathogens.
              | Seeds which were removed and only the thread recovered were presumed predated. .

text          | Assessment of seed predator identity. The arrays of 5 species with masses ~2 g or
              | larger were monitored with Reconyx RC-55 infrared cameras on BCI for the first
              | week. Only half of the Virola arrays were monitored due to camera limitation. In
              | addition, the arrays of two of the larger-seeded species, A. standleyanum and A.
              | butyracea were monitored in PNS. More species were not monitored in PNS due to
              | concerns over equipment loss. As a conservative assignment of seed predator identity,
              | the species of seed predator was only recorded when the removal of a marked seed
              | was clearly visible in the image. Instances of probable seed removal, but in which
              | camera angle, position of the animal, or clarity of the image prevented a clear

title         | DISCUSSION
blank         | 
text          | Hunting is a pervasive threat to biodiversity in tropical forests. Decreases in plant
              | diversity as high as 66% have been documented as an indirect consequence of hunting.
              | Yet the mechanisms by which that diversity is lost are poorly understood, as is their
              | context dependence. This study aimed to test some basic assumptions about plant-
              | seed predator interactions in the context of seed size, as well as hypotheses as to how
              | those interactions may change as a consequence of defaunation. This information is
              | useful for understanding how vertebrate seed predators shape community level
              | distributions of seed size, and to predict how and why plant community composition
              | may change with increasing hunting intensity.
              |        This discussion focuses primarily on plant-seed predator interactions.
              | However, as several of the animals relevant to this discussion are also recognized to be
              | secondary seed dispersers, much of the discussion which follows is equally relevant to
              | seed dispersal.

text          | Seed size and vertebrate seed predation intensity. Overall, this study found little
              | support for the model assumption that vertebrate seed predation rates are correlated
              | with seed mass, either positively in moderately defaunated sites, or negatively in
              | highly defaunated sites. Other seed traits, as well as natural history, may be more
              | important for determining seed predation rates than seed mass per se. For instance, of
              | the three of largest seed-species in this study, the Astrocaryum and Attelea exhibited
              | the highest rates of seed removal, whereas Gustavia exhibited one of the lowest.
              | Relative to Gustavia, the palm seeds have an endosperm that is high in fat content, and
              | therefore energy rich for their weight. The rodents are well adapted to the primary
              | defense of these palms against seed predators: a woody endocarp. While the thin seed
              | coat of Gustavia would appear to make it more vulnerable to vertebrate seed
              | predators, it may exhibit chemical defenses that make them less desirable to
              | rodents(e.g. Forget 1992). Indeed, it was not uncommon on BCI and PNS to see bits
              | of Gustavia pulp with a pile of intact seeds of the forest floor, the result of agoutis
              | consuming the fruit flesh and discarding the seeds (E. Kurten, pers. obs.). However,

text          | there are circumstances in which Gustavia seed predation has been higher (Sork 1987,
              | Forget 1992).
              |         The natural history of the two palm species also make them preferable for
              | hoarding.    A. standleyanum and A. butyracea germinate after 8 and 12 months
              | respectively. Therefore, they are likely to persist intact as hoarded seeds until the
              | period of low fruit availability from November through February (Foster 1982). In
              | contrast, Gustavia germinates within 1-2 weeks of fruit fall (E. Kurten, pers. obs.).
              | While the seeds remain attached to the establishing seedling for many more months,
              | seeds and cotyledons are vulnerable to consumption by other seedling predators, and
              | seed energy stores become reduced over time. By November, Gustavia seedlings are
              | no longer of interest to agoutis on BCI (Forget 1992). Therefore, in contrast to the
              | palms, Gustavia is not a species useful for provisioning rodents through the period of
              | low fruit availability.
              |         Comparison of the large-seeded palm species and Gustavia illustrates how
              | variability in seed consumption by vertebrates among seeds of similar size is likely to
              | be introduced by a variety of differences in nutritive value, defense traits, and
              | germination strategy. Variation in these traits will likely cause deviations in
              | consumption rates from what may be predicted by seed size and optimal foraging
              | theory alone.

text          | Seed predator identity. Camera-based observations for five species preyed upon by
              | vertebrates showed little support for the model assumptions that the seed predator
              | body size is correlated with the size of the seed. While enclosure and exclosure
              | experiments have demonstrated that small rodents prefer small seeded species to
              | taxonomically related larger seeds, and can exert a large, and disproportionate seed
              | predation pressure on smaller seeded species (Dirzo et al. 2007, Mendoza & Dirzo
              | 2007), this study suggests that when seeds are available to the entire community of
              | potential seed predators, the importance of smaller mammals, even for relatively
              | smaller seeds, is diminished. In particular, agoutis appear to be a highly important
              | seed predator and secondary seed disperser in this system.

text          |         There may be other circumstances, however, in which the relationship between
              | seed size and seed predator biomass may be stronger. It is notable that, despite the
              | fact that peccaries are well-documented seed predators of palms such as Astrocaryum
              | and Attelea in many parts of the Neotropics (Beck 2006), no observations of predation
              | of these two species by peccaries were observed in this study. This is likely due to the
              | fact that larger-bodied seed predators such as peccaries and brocket deer tend to
              | consume fruits and seeds under fruiting trees, where fruit and seed densities are
              | highest and foraging most efficient. In contrast, the seed arrays in this experiment best
              | mimicked the situation in which a few seeds have already been dispersed away from
              | the parent tree. Rodents such as agoutis and squirrels, will also forage under fruiting
              | trees. However, as scatter-hoarding species, they are behaviorally more likely than
              | larger seed predators to search for, find and consume small, isolated patches of seeds
              | on the forest floor.
              |         In addition to dispersal context, the composition of the mammal community is
              | likely influential in determining the strength of any relationship between seed size and
              | seed disperser size. For example, in forests such as Cocha Cashu, Peru, agoutis are
              | much less abundant (Terborgh & Wright 1994), and therefore less likely to
              | demonstrate a high importance as seed predators and seed dispersers across a range of
              | species, as seen on BCI. BCI is also lacking an abundance of terrestrial vertebrates at
              | the two extremes of seed predator body size. White-lipped peccaries (T. pecari) have
              | been locally extinct for more than half a century on BCI, and tapirs are rare. At the
              | other extreme, in parts of Mexico and Belize, mice such as Peromyscus and
              | Heteromys can be significant seed predators of some species (Coates-Estrada &
              | Estrada 1988, Klinger and Rejmanek 2009), whereas rodents smaller than spiny rats
              | (P. steerii) are rare on BCI.

text          | hunted site relative to the protected site. Rates of seed caching of large-seeded palms,
              | critical for seedling recruitment in those species, also did not differ between sites.
              | These data corroborate the work of Wright and colleagues (2001) with respect to
              | large-seeded palms, and extend it to a broader spectrum of species.
              |        Rather than seed predation, and secondary seed dispersal, varying linearly with
              | agouti abundance in this system, it may be useful to consider the possibility of seed
              | predator thresholds. In particular, lower populations of agoutis as a consequence of
              | hunting may serve to decrease competition for fruit and seed resources among agoutis
              | locally, but within certain limits, may not interfere with seed dispersal and seed
              | predation rates from the perspective of the plant. However, if hunting reduces agouti
              | populations below a particular threshold in abundance, there are no longer enough
              | animals to adequately maintain levels of seed predation and dispersal.
              |        Conceptualizing the disruption of plant-seed predator interactions in terms of
              | thresholds is similar to the model proposed by Galetti and colleagues (2006), in which
              | Astrocaryum seed predation rates are a sigmoidal or logistic, rather than linear,
              | function of agouti abundance. Data from two defaunation gradients suggest this may
              | be the case (Fig. 4.7). In Panama, sites with agouti densities 60%-80% lower than
              | BCI still had high rodent seed predation rates equivalent to or higher than those
              | observed on BCI, but where agouti densities were further reduced, seed predation rates
              | dropped dramatically (Wright et al. 2001). Likewise in Brazil, sites with agouti
              | abundances 80% lower than the maximum density observed still maintained agouti
              | seed predation rates approximately equal to those observed in the sites with the highest
              | agouti abundance (Donatti et al. 2009).

              | predation rates should vary as a function of seed size and defaunation intensity found
              | little general support for the model. In this system, there was only weak support for a
              | relationship between seed mass and vertebrate seed predation rate, and no evidence
              | that seeds were increasingly predated upon by larger-bodied seed predators as seed
              | size increased by species. Furthermore, despite large differences in the abundances of

              | when trying to predict the indirect effects of hunting on plant recruitment. It also is
              | consistent with accumulating evidence that the functional roles that seed predators and
              | seed dispersers play in tropical forests may not be linearly correlated with their
              | abundance in a system, but rather, may be threshold-dependent.
