blank         | 
text          |          This dissertation explores how seven low-income Hispanic-Latino immigrant
blank         | 
text          | families with young children use broadcast and digital media – sources that have
blank         | 
text          | become a substantial part of families’ language and literacy environment but whose
blank         | 
text          | role is little understood. In particular, this study focuses on media’s role in families’
blank         | 
text          | language- and literacy- related activities. The study takes a three-pronged approach
blank         | 
text          | that includes: ethnographic case studies of seven families; an intervention wherein I
blank         | 
text          | distributed a tablet device (iPad) to each case family and documented the role it took
blank         | 
text          | on in everyday family life and learning; and case parents’ reponses to the Families and
blank         | 
text          | Media survey (Rideout, 2014) that was also administered to a nationally representative
blank         | 
text          | sample. The case studies provide rich data regarding families’ existing media
blank         | 
text          | ecologies and practices, while the intervention gives a glimpse of the opportunities
blank         | 
text          | and/or challenges a new technology can bring and how families take up new media
blank         | 
text          | tools.
blank         | 
text          |          The study looks at media use from a sociocultural perspective, which includes
blank         | 
text          | the ways family members engage with media together and how media relates to a
blank         | 
text          | variety of family interactions including joint media engagement (Takeuchi & Stevens,
blank         | 
text          | 2011). The findings reveal a variety of practices that families engaged in for seeking
blank         | 
text          | knowledge on the Internet, as well as entertainment and play – many of which
blank         | 
text          | included meaningful language and literacy experiences. Media played several roles
blank         | 
text          | which included: helping to “bridge” home and school settings, supporting parents in
blank         | 
text          | their own studies or careers and facilitating children’s interest-driven learning across
blank         | 
text          | settings. The iPad intervention led to some new language- and literacy-related

text          | practices, based to some degree on the characteristics of the device, but mostly on the
blank         | 
text          | quality of the content that was included with the iPad. The new iPad content allowed
blank         | 
text          | families to engage in some language- and literacy-related media activities they hadn’t
blank         | 
text          | done before, including using ebooks and recording their own animated stories. I argue
blank         | 
text          | that media is an important focus of study for understanding the language and literacy
blank         | 
text          | experiences of Hispanic-Latino immigrant children and that links between media
blank         | 
text          | practices and the development of language and literacy skills merit much greater
blank         | 
text          | attention than has been afforded in the past. This study shows clear evidence of
blank         | 
text          | families’ active and strategic forms of pursuing learning at home.

text          |        This research would not have been possible without the nurturing and support
              | of so many academic and personal allies.

text          |         First, I owe a debt of gratitude to my advisors, Dr. Brigid Barron and Dr.
              | Shelley Goldman. I have been fortunate to work with two such innovative and brilliant
              | scholars that also care deeply about mentoring students. Thank you to Brigid for
              | inviting me to join the YouthLAB team and for your constant mentorship over the past
              | six years, as well as the encouragement to pursue this topic of research. Thank you to
              | Shelley for all of your invaluable input and guidance along the way, for the many
              | important opportunities to connect scholarship with design, and for reminding me to
              | make more explicit connections to social justice.
blank         | 
text          |        Many thanks also to Dr. Guadalupe Valdés and Dr. Claude Goldenberg, you
              | both have given invaluable guidance on the topic of immigrant families and language,
              | and helped encourage this new line of research. Your life’s work has also informed
              | this work in myriad ways. Dr. Valdés deserves special recognition for originally
              | proposing the tablet intervention method that added an innovative dimension to the
              | study.
blank         | 
text          |         The Amir Lopatin Fellowship provided generous funding support for this
              | dissertation project. I would like to extend special thanks to the Lopatin family for
              | their loving dedication to carrying forward Amir’s dreams and for sharing his belief in
              | the potential of technology to transform education. This research is also supported by
              | the LIFE Science of Learning Center (Learning in Informal and Formal Environments),
              | an NSF funded (REC-354453) effort seeking to understand and advance human
              | learning through a simultaneous focus on implicit, informal and formal learning, thus
              | cultivating generalizable interdisciplinary theories that can guide the design of
              | effective new technologies and learning environments. I thank the LIFE Center for
              | providing direct funding of a Research Assistantship that allowed me to research and
              | write this dissertation, as well as exposure to its unique network of interdisciplinary
              | faculty and students. I am also grateful to the Heising-Simons foundation for their
              | support.

text          |          Over the course of this study and my career at Stanford I have benefited
              | enormously from working with scholars and mentors who have shared expertise with
              | me. A special thanks to the team at the Joan Ganz Cooney Center and Sesame
              | Workshop – including Dr. Michael Levine, Dr. June Lee and particularly Dr. Lori
              | Takeuchi. It has been a joy to participate in three of collaborative Cooney Center-led
              | projects – the Families and Media Project, the Aprendiendo Juntos Council and the
              | Joint Media Engagement Consortium. These have been invaluable opportunities for
              | me to learn and to share my research. Thanks to Dr. Vikki Katz, also a member of
              | these groups, for the inspiring example and advice on working with immigrant
              | families. At Stanford, I thank Dr. Sam Wineburg, for the mentorship, teaching and
              | critical eye that improved my scholarship in many ways. I also thank my “advisors-in-

              | 
title         | Part I: The Need
blank         | 
text          |           Digital media use for work, play, and learning is on the rise. This is true not only
blank         | 
text          | for adults but also for children of all ages. How does media time in families’ day relate to
blank         | 
text          | learning? As devices proliferate and time spent with both “old” and “new” media
blank         | 
text          | increases, research needs to address questions about how these technologies can support
blank         | 
text          | productive learning and development. This dissertation is an attempt to better understand
blank         | 
text          | the possibilities of learning with media, and to contribute to how family media ecologies
blank         | 
text          | are considered in relationship to learning. Family media ecology is not only the physical
blank         | 
text          | setting (availability and pervasiveness of media devices) but also the social and cultural
blank         | 
text          | context (routines, practices, rules and beliefs) that shape how media is used.
blank         | 
text          |           Past research on family media use has focused predominantly on mainstream
blank         | 
text          | culture and middle-class families. There has been little attention to minority and
blank         | 
text          | underserved groups. Nationally representative survey data on young children and media
blank         | 
text          | show that children zero to eight from low-income families consume more screen media
blank         | 
text          | than their middle- and high-income counterparts (Common Sense Media, 2011; 2013).
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino children have been shown to consume more television, but have less
blank         | 
text          | access to computers and the Internet than (non-Hispanic) white children (Espinosa, Laffey
blank         | 
text          | & Whittaker, 2006). The average time spent with screen media overall for children zero to
blank         | 
text          | eight years old is nearly two hours per day (Common Sense Media, 2013) – yet there has
blank         | 
text          | been very little light shed on what content children from non-dominant backgrounds
blank         | 
text          | access and what role this media plays in development, learning and family life (Katz,
blank         |

text          | 2010). Although research has shown a positive relationship between computer access and
blank         | 
text          | scores on early cognitive development scores, and a negative relationship between
blank         | 
text          | watching television and these scores (Espinosa et al., 2006), existing large-scale research
blank         | 
text          | has not been able to pinpoint what impact media use patterns may have on children’s
blank         | 
text          | schooling and learning. This dissertation seeks to contribute toward informing researchers,
blank         | 
text          | educators and media producers about how low-income Latino immigrant families – whose
blank         | 
text          | primary language is not English – engage with media, and what entry points for English
blank         | 
text          | learning media might provide.

text          | Why Hispanic-Latino Families?
blank         | 
text          |           On the whole, Hispanic-Latino families in the United States face greater risks on
blank         | 
text          | a number of fronts than do White or African-American families. Recent estimates show a
blank         | 
text          | larger proportion of Hispanic-Latino children living in poverty as compared to children of
blank         | 
text          | other backgrounds (Lopez & Velasco, 2011, cited in Vaala, 2013). Hispanic-Latino youth
blank         | 
text          | have higher school dropout rates and higher rates of teenage pregnancy (Pew Hispanic
blank         | 
text          | Center, 2009). Hispanic-Latino families, particularly those at low income levels, may have
blank         | 
text          | less access to center-based early childhood programs – a potential disadvantage that is
blank         | 
text          | compounded by the challenge many children face attending school in a language that is
blank         | 
text          | new to them (Vaala, 2013). Concern regarding the literacy development of children from
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino immigrant families has grown largely because of the “disproportionate
blank         | 
text          | underachievement” (Reese & Gallimore, 2000, p. 103) of minority students – including
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino children – in U.S. schools and the so-called “achievement gap” between
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino and white students (e.g. Bali & Alvarez, 2004). Hispanic-Latino children

blank         | 
text          | additional hurdles. Although popular belief might imagine that these school-age children
blank         | 
text          | quickly “absorb” a new language with little effort, in-depth research has shown that
blank         | 
text          | becoming a competent English user is often a long and challenging journey that is not
blank         | 
text          | adequately supported in schools (Valdés, Capitelli & Álvarez, 2011). As Valdés and
blank         | 
text          | colleagues point out, this issue can be particularly acute in under resourced areas and
blank         | 
text          | schools with large populations of English learners. Espinosa et al.’s (2006) nationally
blank         | 
text          | representative study among language-minority, largely Spanish-speaking children has
blank         | 
text          | found that technology access at home is linked to achievement scores in grades K-3 but
blank         | 
text          | also highly co-related to socio-economic status. The authors recommend more in-depth
blank         | 
text          | research on this topic to further investigate the role of these resources in children’s home
blank         | 
text          | activities.
blank         | 
text          |                                                          At the same time, basic access to devices and the Internet among Latino
blank         | 
text          | families is growing rapidly; in some instances at higher rates than families from other
blank         | 
text          | ethnic groups. According to recent Pew Internet & American Life polls, for example,
blank         | 
text          | Latino adults possess smartphones and tablet computers at similar or higher rates as
blank         | 
text          | compared to White and Black non-Hispanic adults (Lopez, Gonzalez-Barrera & Patten,
blank         | 
text          | 2013).1 Recent data shows a rapid rise in technology activities among Hispanic-Latinos in
blank         | 
text          | the United States, particularly among those born outside the United States and those who
blank         | 
text          | are primarily Spanish Speakers (López et al., 2013 - detailed data is presented in the
blank         | 
text          | review of the literature that follows). Given the great challenges families face and their
blank         | 
text          | growing access to media, questions arise as to how these families are leveraging media

text          | attention to the present-day “transition period,” in which new technologies are opening up
blank         | 
text          | new possibilities, but are also still met, understandably, with apprehension. As Gutnick et
blank         | 
text          | al. (2011) point out, our society is still in search of the “right balance” of media in
blank         | 
text          | children’s lives:
blank         | 
text          |    A vigorous national dialogue is taking place over the right balance between media
              |    consumption, the potential negative impact that inappropriate digital content can have on
              |    vulnerable children, and the worry that children are increasingly leading physically inactive
              |    lives. These legitimate concerns must be juxtaposed with emerging evidence from the learning
              |    sciences and innovative practices showing how well-deployed digital media can promote new
              |    skills, raise achievement, and bring children together across time and space. (p. 2)
blank         | 
text          | As acknowledged in the passage, fears around media use are warranted and important to
blank         | 
text          | address. Parents who have immigrated to United States and are not fluent in English – not
blank         | 
text          | to mention many aspects of technology – may experience these feelings particularly
blank         | 
text          | acutely (Tripp, 2011). However, young children and their families also may stand to
blank         | 
text          | benefit a great deal from certain types of media, and these apprehensions may be – as the
blank         | 
text          | saying goes – “throwing out the baby with the bathwater.” By approaching media use as a
blank         | 
text          | social activity, this study seeks to identify ways that family media use can lead to growth,
blank         | 
text          | development and family interactions, rather than inactivity and isolation. It also
blank         | 
text          | highlights the importance of media content as an important factor, as opposed to measures
blank         | 
text          | of screen time, device ownership or Internet use alone.

text          |    Although literature on the topic of Hispanic-Latino families and digital media use is
blank         | 
text          | not yet well-developed, recent initiatives such as the Aprendiendo Juntos Council led by
blank         | 
text          | the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop have made this area of research a
blank         | 
text          | primary focus. In June 2012, JGC in partnership with the National Center for Family
blank         | 
text          | Literacy and the National Council of La Raza led the first forum bringing together
blank         | 
text          | scholars working in this field. This group of partners then formed the Aprendiendo Juntos
blank         | 
text          | Council and have continued to convene scholars including myself to chart a course for
blank         | 
text          | new research on this subject. Members of the council have identified several important
blank         | 
text          | directions for future study, including how to leverage Internet technologies to connect and
blank         | 
text          | engage parents and their children’s schools (Constantakis & Valdés, 2013), how families
blank         | 
text          | use media to access information and services in their communities (Katz, 2013) and
blank         | 
text          | internet use among immigrant parents and U.S.-born children (Tripp, 2013). This
blank         | 
text          | dissertation research is one contribution to this effort to begin to understand how
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino families use and learn with media and what the opportunities might be to
blank         | 
text          | engage and benefit family learning for this population.
blank         | 
text          |    This dissertation uses ethnographic methods to construct rich portraits of seven
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic- Latino immigrants and their young children’s media-related activities and
blank         | 
text          | values. This study contributes to current knowledge in education and learning sciences
blank         | 
text          | for several reasons. It helps to fill a gap in empirical data on how recently immigrated
blank         | 
text          | Latino families with young children employ media for learning (if at all) and what role
blank         | 
text          | media plays in development. Second, the study takes a holistic look at family practices
blank         | 
text          | and family learning, identifying ways that both parents and children are making use of
blank         | 
text          | media and how social arrangements and interactions shape learning and behavior around

blank         | 
text          | (specifically tablet computers) take on in these households when families acquire them.
blank         | 
text          | While qualitative case studies with a small number of families will result in data that is
blank         | 
text          | less generalizable than larger, randomized studies, they have the depth to help lay the
blank         | 
text          | groundwork for future research, capturing detailed accounts of family life and providing a
blank         | 
text          | nuanced account of home practices among Hispanic-Latino immigrant families.
blank         | 
text          |            The kind of knowledge this study provides is a valuable resource if we are to
blank         | 
text          | increase the value proposition of educational media for underserved children and families
blank         | 
text          | in this country. Currently, much media is designed and produced without an
blank         | 
text          | understanding of the diverse social and cultural environments where the media is used. In
blank         | 
text          | my view, this research is extremely important to help inform media producers, educators
blank         | 
text          | and policy-makers as they endeavor to serve this population and enable them to re-
blank         | 
text          | imagine media resources such that they fit into the familial, social and cultural realities of
blank         | 
text          | young children and their families.

title         | Part II: What Do We Know? A Review of the Literature
blank         | 
text          |           This study draws upon frameworks and builds upon findings from diverse
blank         | 
text          | disciplinary approaches. Currently there is no well-developed, robust research literature
blank         | 
text          | on media practices that specifically addresses Hispanic-Latino and/or immigrant families,
blank         | 
text          | and few existing studies address the full range of present-day media platforms. As the
blank         | 
text          | present study belongs to an emerging line of inquiry and has a strong exploratory element,
blank         | 
text          | its support stems from various areas of scholarship that are related in one aspect or another,
blank         | 
text          | but diverge in others. Research reviewed here includes studies of family media use (not
blank         |

text          | literacy development, education of children from immigrant families (particularly
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino families), and the small, emergent body of research that has begun to
blank         | 
text          | specifically address media use among Hispanic-Latino immigrant families. The following
blank         | 
text          | sections support these four overall points:
blank         | 
text          | 1. Technology access is growing rapidly among low-income, Hispanic-Latino immigrant
blank         | 
text          |    families, and research must focus on how technology is being used rather than on
blank         | 
text          |    device access only. Research has shown links between academic scores and
blank         | 
text          |    technology access, however there has been little in-depth research revealing what
blank         | 
text          |    underlies these relationships.
blank         | 
text          | 2. Beyond devices and content, it is important to consider the social context of media use.
blank         | 
text          |    Research has shown that children can learn from screen media and parent participation
blank         | 
text          |    in media activities increases learning. In-depth studies that document the social
blank         | 
text          |    context of use in family homes can reveal these processes.
blank         | 
text          | 3. For language minority children and adults, a variety of studies have shown positive
blank         | 
text          |    relationships between screen media use (in various formats, with and without text) and
blank         | 
text          |    test scores measuring skills in the L2 (second language). These studies suggest media
blank         | 
text          |    can support and advance language learning (not replace human interaction).
blank         | 
text          | 4. Research on Hispanic-Latino families’ home literacy practices draws attention to
blank         | 
text          |    similarities and differences between home and school, and how home literacy
blank         | 
text          |    practices are influential. Based on this literature one might ask the question of how
blank         | 
text          |    these relationships play out when families use media together.

title         | Hispanic-Latino Language Minority Families and Technology Access
blank         | 
text          |           Technology access is growing rapidly among low-income, Hispanic-Latino
blank         | 
text          | immigrant families, and research must focus on how technology is being used rather than
blank         | 
text          | on device access only. Research has identified promise in exploring technology’s benefits
blank         | 
text          | for language minority children. In Espinosa et al.’s (2006) nationally representative,
blank         | 
text          | large-scale study of language minority children, technology access – including television
blank         | 
text          | and computer programs as well as books and other media – at home showed a positive
blank         | 
text          | relationship to scores on the ECLS-K assessment of growth in reading and math between
blank         | 
text          | kindergarten and third grade. However, the report acknowledges that certain aspects such
blank         | 
text          | as strong co-variance with socio-economic status create the need for more in-depth
blank         | 
text          | research to parse out these relationships. In addition, the ECLS-K study did not capture
blank         | 
text          | the language or content of media children used, and the authors argue that this type of
blank         | 
text          | information currently missing in the research would be necessary to more fully inform our
blank         | 
text          | understanding of technology’s value for language minority children. In the authors’ own
blank         | 
text          | assessment, as computing tools become increasingly available in various languages they
blank         | 
text          | stand to offer important instructional opportunities for language minority children
blank         | 
text          | (Espinosa et al., 2006). More detailed data on children’s language, the content they use
blank         | 
text          | and their practices with technology would provide a clearer picture of these relationships.
blank         | 
text          |           With regard to computing and internet use, the disparity known as the “digital
blank         | 
text          | divide” emerged as a popular concept of inequality in technology access between low-
blank         | 
text          | income, undeserved families and communities and higher-income, educated ones.
blank         | 
text          | However, since its inception the focus in the digital divide debate has shifted away from
blank         | 
text          | access to equipment alone. As price points, devices and their capabilities are rapidly

text          | changing and Internet connectivity is available to a much broader population, new
blank         | 
text          | questions have been posed about the true meaning of “access” and what is necessary to
blank         | 
text          | provide an equitable playing field for all, even if obtaining physical devices is no longer
blank         | 
text          | an obstacle. To date several works (e.g. Warschauer, 2010; 2011; Margolis, 2008) have
blank         | 
text          | documented the insufficiency of devices and Internet access alone to bridge divides, and
blank         | 
text          | the many inequities that persist due to what Gomez, Barron, Pinkard and Martin (2014)
blank         | 
text          | term the “digital experience divide.” The term refocuses attention on kinds of mentorship,
blank         | 
text          | tools and support that are often absent even where equipment exists. Gomez and
blank         | 
text          | colleagues argue that digital media literacies – abilities to engage in meaningful activities
blank         | 
text          | with technology – can only develop given the necessary opportunities and support.
blank         | 
              | 
text          |    With respect to reading, for example, children who struggle to learn to read continue to read less
              |    than their classmates, and as a consequence their vocabulary, background knowledge, and fluency
              |    in decoding and comprehension are hindered. In turn, the divide between the more and less
              |    literate grows wider. With computing, deep engagement in digital media hobbies can similarly
              |    lead to expertise development, self-efficacy, and new forms of creative agency—all critical
              |    pieces of necessary twenty-first-century skills. In the absence of these interests and of the
              |    opportunities to develop them, these skills cannot emerge. Ensuring equitable access for all is
              |    essential. (p. 8)
blank         | 
text          | In this way, the “digital divide” has been reconceptualized to signify the disparity in the
blank         | 
text          | resources that empower learners to productively use digital media, rather than a problem
blank         | 
text          | that can be solved by providing technology alone whether in homes, schools or in
blank         | 
text          | informal learning spaces. Delivering books to children is not enough to bridge the gap in
blank         | 
text          | literacy opportunities – various supports and instruction must also accompany it. By this
blank         | 
text          | token, efforts to equalize technology experience must also incorporate both physical and
blank         | 
text          | instructional resources.
blank         | 
text          |    What does the digital divide mean for the U.S. Hispanic-Latino population? As with
blank         | 
text          | much of the large-scale data on technology access, the focus is on devices and access

text          | rather than on social or educational resources related to media, such as instruction and
blank         | 
text          | mentoring. Pew Hispanic Center (Lopez, Barrera and Patten, 2013) notes significant
blank         | 
text          | changes in technology access among Hispanic-Latinos in the United States between 2009
blank         | 
text          | and 2013. Whereas a report based on 2009 survey data found that Hispanic-Latinos used
blank         | 
text          | the internet less and were less likely to have cell phones, particularly those who were
blank         | 
text          | Spanish-dominant and/or born outside the U.S (Livingston, 2010), Lopez and colleagues’
blank         | 
text          | more recent report on data from 2012 shows that in terms of cell phone use, going online
blank         | 
text          | and using social networking sites, the Hispanic-Latino population is “just as connected as
blank         | 
text          | other Americans” (p. 6). The change was attributed in particular to a sharp rise in these
blank         | 
text          | technology activities among Spanish-dominant and foreign-born Hispanic-Latinos
blank         | 
text          | (including those born in Puerto Rico). Gaps still exist, however, between English-
blank         | 
text          | dominant or U.S. born Hispanic-Latinos, who are more likely to use the Internet, and
blank         | 
text          | those who are foreign born and/or Spanish-dominant, who are less likely to do so.
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latinos in general are also somewhat less likely than the general population to
blank         | 
text          | have a laptop or desktop computer – 72 per cent of Hispanic-Latinos versus 79 per cent of
blank         | 
text          | the overall population. In addition, and relevant to this review, families with dependent
blank         | 
text          | children were more likely to use the Internet. Demographic factors that continue to be
blank         | 
text          | strongly related to technology use include age (younger people and those with a higher
blank         | 
text          | level of formal education are more likely to use technology) but these patterns exist
blank         | 
text          | among Caucasians and African-Americans as well.
blank         | 
text          |           As Katz (2010) argues, access to devices and technological fluency may pose
blank         | 
text          | greater challenge to children in low-income immigrant families than to those from middle-
blank         | 
text          | class, majority culture families. Despite growing access among underserved populations,

blank         | 
text          | (Common Sense Media, 2013; Joan Ganz Cooney Center, 2013). Katz emphasizes the
blank         | 
text          | importance of considering the particular concerns of families when researching their
blank         | 
text          | activities with technology:
blank         | 
text          |    Low-income children often have irregular or no access to computers and Internet access,
              |    making them less likely to develop the media literacy required for the range of media

text          | However, three or four years’ time can be significant when it comes to the spread of
blank         | 
text          | technology. The most recent Pew Hispanic data cited above identifies rapid changes and
blank         | 
text          | adoption of certain technologies. In particular the growth in mobile phone and Internet
blank         | 
text          | use among foreign-born Hispanic-Latinos and those who are primarily Spanish speakers
blank         | 
text          | indicates that at the very least, families in this group are increasingly likely to have the
blank         | 
text          | devices and Internet service needed to access technology resources. However, as argued
blank         | 
text          | above, equalizing access to equipment is only the beginning of bridging divides. The Pew
blank         | 
text          | data tell us very little or nothing about the nature of media activities or content accessed
blank         | 
text          | among the Hispanic-Latino population, or the divides that may still exist in terms of
blank         | 
text          | access to instruction on how to use technology and how to productively leverage
blank         | 
text          | computing tools. Unfortunately, the data only provides information on the use of social
blank         | 
text          | networking sites, and not of other resources, activities or supports.
blank         | 
text          |    Other research on the digital divide investigates individuals’ attitudes toward
blank         | 
text          | technology, and show some relationships between these attitudes and demographic and
blank         | 
text          | language factors. In a survey of over 200 Hispanic-Latino college students in the
blank         |

text          | dominant students had more favorable attitudes toward the Internet and technology use
blank         | 
text          | and less anxiety related to these activities than Spanish-dominant students (who made up
blank         | 
text          | more than half of the sample). The authors theorize that the prevalence of English-
blank         | 
text          | language content on the internet may account for some of the Spanish speakers’ less
blank         | 
text          | favorable responses. In addition, because English-dominant students were more likely to
blank         | 
text          | have a computer at home, the authors suggest that these attitudes toward technology may
blank         | 
text          | be related to home technology access, based on prior research that showed this pattern
blank         | 
text          | (Selwyn, 1999; Ravenaugh, 2000; as cited in Slate et al., 2003). The study also found
blank         | 
text          | gender differences, where male Hispanic-Latino students expressed more positive
blank         | 
text          | attitudes and less anxiety regarding technology as compared to female students. Benitez
blank         | 
text          | (2006) also documents similar gender differences in attitudes about technology in his
blank         | 
text          | media ethnography of Salvadoran immigrants in Washington, DC. In addition, Benitez
blank         | 
text          | found that some immigrants who had access to the Internet at home were conscious of the
blank         | 
text          | fact that they did not have the necessary understanding or training to use it in all the ways
blank         | 
text          | they would like. In sum, as physical device and network access appears to be more and
blank         | 
text          | more widespread, disparities in practices with technology and the degree to which these
blank         | 
text          | are supported and informed in different populations remains an important issue to address.

title         | Media, Learning and Social Context of Use
blank         | 
text          |           Given the situation that low-income, non-dominant and language minority
blank         | 
text          | families are gaining increasing access to devices and Internet connections and also watch
blank         | 
text          | television regularly, it is important to identify what value these types of media might offer.
blank         | 
text          | A growing number of studies have identified relationships between media use and

text          | learning, and an increasing number of studies take into account different factors beyond
blank         | 
text          | screen time such as media content and the social arrangements in the context of use
blank         | 
text          | (Dugan, Stevens & Mehus, 2010; Dugan, 2012; Takeuchi & Stevens, 2011; Rideout 2014).
blank         | 
text          | This literature draws attention to the fact that while the amount of time spent with media is
blank         | 
text          | important, other factors including interpersonal interactions – between parents and
blank         | 
text          | children, peers or other groups – shape the nature of learning with media.
blank         | 
text          |           Some studies have indicated that even infants can imitate and learn from what
blank         | 
text          | they see on television and video (Meltzoff, 1988; Mumme & Fernald, 2003), however
blank         | 
text          | most consensus around television’s learning benefits begins with preschool-age children.
blank         | 
text          | According to Kirkorian, Wartella and Anderson’s (2008) extensive review of the research
blank         | 
text          | on children and media, the literature indicates that by 3 years of age children can learn
blank         | 
text          | from age-appropriate educational television. Studies of the pioneering educational
blank         | 
text          | program Sesame Street – the most researched children’s television show – have shown
blank         | 
text          | positive effects of watching on children’s academic and social school readiness (e.g. Fisch
blank         | 
text          | and Truglio, 2001; Bogatz and Ball, 1971). Studies of Sesame Street also indicate that
blank         | 
text          | children learn more from the program in terms of literacy and numeracy when they view
blank         | 
text          | alongside a parent. For example, Salomon (1977) compared two groups of low-income
blank         | 
text          | Israeli children and found the group whose mothers were encouraged to watch Sesame
blank         | 
text          | Street alongside their children learned more than the group whose mothers were not
blank         | 
text          | encouraged to co-view. Reiser, Tessmer and Phelps (1984) also found that children
blank         | 
text          | learned more when parents were instructed to prompt and ask questions of children while
blank         | 
text          | viewing Sesame Street. Similarly, Reiser, Williamson, & Suzuki (1988) compared four
blank         | 
text          | conditions of adult-child interactions while watching the show and found that children
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
              |

text          | assigned to conditions where an adult asked them questions, or asked questions and
blank         | 
text          | offered feedback, showed greater comprehension gains than child groups where adults
blank         | 
text          | simply watched alongside them or only directed their attention to the screen. The vast
blank         | 
text          | majority of studies on educational television do not specifically address bilingual families
blank         | 
text          | or families whose primary home language is different from the language of the TV
blank         | 
text          | programming (some exceptions are noted later in this chapter). Particularly relevant to
blank         | 
text          | this review, the “Early Window Project” documenting the impact of Sesame Street also
blank         | 
text          | found that Spanish-speaking parents often reported watching Sesame Street along with
blank         | 
text          | their children as a way of learning English themselves (Wright, Huston, Murphy, St.
blank         | 
text          | Peters, Piñon, Scantlin & Kotler, 2001).
blank         | 
text          |           In their synthetic review focused on the youngest children, Linebarger and Vaala
blank         | 
text          | (2010) reiterate the argument that babies and toddlers can learn from screen media and
blank         | 
text          | that social factors that surround them while they watch are important. They posit that the
blank         | 
text          | degree to which media engagement can affect language development depends on three
blank         | 
text          | main factors: the person or people engaging with the media, the content of the program
blank         | 
text          | itself and contextual factors such as social and physical setting. The review presents a
blank         | 
text          | diverse set of findings about the relationship between screen media and learning, and
blank         | 
text          | emphasizes the importance of content and the way that content is matched with children’s
blank         | 
text          | developmental niche. Among the research findings synthesized in the review are the
blank         | 
text          | connections between television viewing and developing literacy skills in children. The
blank         | 
text          | review cites evidence that older children use the same narrative comprehension skills to
blank         | 
text          | understand both print and screen media (Kendeou, Lynch, van den Broek, Espin, White
blank         | 
text          | and Kremer, 2005). In addition, the authors highlight Linebarger and Piotrowski’s (2009)

text          | finding that screen media exposure can support preschoolers in developing skills related to
blank         | 
text          | print narratives, including comprehension and production. Again, the way that media is
blank         | 
text          | incorporated into the social context of the home is important. The above studies
blank         | 
text          | operationalize television as something family members are attending to. In contrast
blank         | 
text          | Kirkorian, Pempek, Murphy, Schmidt and Anderson (2009) also found that so-called
blank         | 
text          | “background television,” – an adult-centered program that was played in the background
blank         | 
text          | during parent-child play in a lab setting – reduced the amount of interaction between
blank         | 
text          | parent and child as compared to when no television was on.
blank         | 
text          |           The literature on children and media also suggests that some demographic factors
blank         | 
text          | may predict how parents interact with children around media. In their work on television
blank         | 
text          | co-viewing, Valkenberg, Krcmar, Peeters and Marseille (1999) developed a framework
blank         | 
text          | that characterized three “parental mediation” styles: restrictive mediation, social
blank         | 
text          | mediation and instructive mediation. Restrictive mediation refers to the ways in which
blank         | 
text          | parents create rules and limits around viewing, limit screen time or programs that can be
blank         | 
text          | watched. Social mediation describes instances where parents watch with children for fun
blank         | 
text          | or to spend time together, without discussing what they see necessarily. Finally
blank         | 
text          | instructive mediation refers to the ways in which parents might prompt children about
blank         | 
text          | program content, help them understand what is happening on screen and model media
blank         | 
text          | literacy practices. While different co-viewing styles can be present within a given family,
blank         | 
text          | the authors found that parents with less education engaged in instructive mediation
blank         | 
text          | (asking questions, prompting children) at a lower rate than more highly educated parents.
blank         | 
text          | The Valkenberg et al., scale has been confirmed as robust by further studies (e.g.
blank         | 
text          | Nathanson, 1999; Warren, 2003; Buijzen, van der Molen, and Sondij, 2007). As with the

text          | studies of Sesame Street, the television co-viewing literature to date does not specifically
blank         | 
text          | address the issue of how parents and/or children who are not fluent in the language of the
blank         | 
text          | programming access meaning from shows or discuss the content they watch.
blank         | 
text          |           While the latter research suggests that families from more educated backgrounds
blank         | 
text          | may do more instructive JME than others, it is not necessarily the case that mainstream
blank         | 
text          | culture or majority language families spend more time in JME with their children.
blank         | 
text          | Specifically concerning Hispanic-Latino families, recent survey research has shown that
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino parents engage jointly with their children for similar or greater
blank         | 
text          | proportions of time as compared to white or African-American parents (similar
blank         | 
text          | proportions with television, and significantly more with mobiles and computers) (Lee &
blank         | 
text          | Barron, 2014). Among Hispanic-Latino parents, those from Spanish-speaking or dual
blank         | 
text          | language households reported more JME than did parents from English-speaking homes.
blank         | 
text          | Thus, although the amount of time parents spend using media together with their children
blank         | 
text          | may depend on any number of factors and may be more feasible in certain homes, it may
blank         | 
text          | actually be more common among families from non-dominant or language minority
blank         | 
text          | backgrounds, rather than the reverse.
blank         | 
text          |             Historically, much of the research on children and media has taken a quantitative
blank         | 
text          | approach using surveys or intervention/control group comparisons along with academic
blank         | 
text          | assessments. However, some researchers have conducted ethnographic, naturalistic
blank         | 
text          | studies of children watching television (Dugan, Stevens & Mehus, 2010; Dugan, 2012)
blank         | 
text          | and playing video games (Stevens, Satwicz and McCarthy, 2008). These authors propose
blank         | 
text          | an “in-show, in-room, in-world” (or “in-game, in-room, in-world”) framework that calls
blank         | 
text          | for and models more nuanced perspectives on how children and families use media, what

blank         | 
text          | children’s and families’ lives. This research in turn has become part of a broader research
blank         | 
text          | agenda around the concept of joint media engagement (JME) to expand and update
blank         | 
text          | concepts put forth by television co-viewing researchers. Joint media engagement is a term
blank         | 
text          | used to describe
blank         | 
text          |    …spontaneous and designed experiences of people using media together. JME can happen
              |    anywhere and at any time when there are multiple people interacting together with media.
              |    Modes of JME include viewing, playing, searching, reading, contributing, and creating, with
              |    either digital or traditional media. JME can support learning by providing resources for making
              |    sense and making meaning in a particular situation, as well as for future situations (Stevens &
              |    Penuel, 2010).
blank         | 
text          | JME moves beyond television to include interactive and mobile media, video and all of
blank         | 
text          | the forms available currently in addition to television. The JME perspective, building on
blank         | 
text          | case studies from a number of researchers and – laid out in greater detail in the Takeuchi
blank         | 
text          | and Stevens’ (2011) report, also draws attention to so-called “asynchronous” interactions,
blank         | 
text          | such as a family discussion the content of a program at dinnertime or a child bringing up
blank         | 
text          | material from a TV show that she watched at home during a classroom activity at school
blank         | 
text          | the next day. Asynchronous JME has also been documented in online forums, as in
blank         | 
text          | Matthews’ (forthcoming) research on fan sites of history-based television shows, where
blank         | 
text          | viewers discuss history as it relates to programs they watch.

text          | from PBS Kids program Sid the Science Kid as centerpieces for discussion and activities.

text          | They trained classroom teachers to engage children in identifying, asking, answering and
blank         | 
text          | other discussion during and between clips. These video clips illustrated science concepts

text          | that teachers explored with children both through discussions of the media and in
blank         | 
text          | classroom activities. The authors found greater learning gains in the groups of children

text          | whose teachers had used the curriculum supplement, and parents of children in these
blank         | 
text          | groups also reported higher frequency of science talk at home (Penuel et al., 2010). The

text          | authors highlight the significance of these findings as evidence that media – if

text          | incorporated into a curriculum that includes a diverse array of interpersonal and hands-on
blank         | 
text          | interactions in addition to media segments or games – can be a beneficial ingredient in

blank         | 
text          |           For language minority children and adults, a variety of studies have shown positive
blank         | 
text          | relationships between screen media use (in various formats, with and without text) and
blank         | 
text          | test scores measuring skills in the L2 (second language). These studies suggest media can
blank         | 
text          | support and advance language learning (not replace human interaction). Leseman, Mayo
blank         | 
text          | and Scheele (2009) studied immigrant families in the Netherlands, comparing native
blank         | 
text          | Dutch speaking families with Turkish (middle-income) and Moroccan (lower-income)
blank         | 
text          | immigrant families, and found a correlation between children’s exposure to Dutch media
blank         | 
text          | (both television and electronic games) and their development of Dutch vocabulary for all
blank         | 
text          | groups. In a synthetic review, Uchikoshi (2008) analyzed studies of media use and
blank         | 
text          | language and literacy development among dual language learners (of various native
blank         | 
text          | languages) in the U.S., and also found that television viewing can aid in children’s English
blank         | 
text          | language and literacy development. Uchikoshi also found in an earlier (2006) study that
blank         | 
text          | children who watched educational television shows at home showed steeper growth on
blank         | 
text          | vocabulary assessments, although the study did not find differences for children who

text          | watched the shows during allotted classroom time.

text          |           Some studies attempt to show relationships by simply looking at the amount of
blank         | 
text          | time children spend with media, rather than considering the content. In this vein,
blank         | 
text          | Blosser’s (1988) study revealed a positive relationship between children’s television
blank         | 
text          | watching and reading scores, as well as vocabulary scores for some groups, and noted
blank         | 
text          | particularly strong correlations for those with higher English proficiency. With a sample
blank         | 
text          | of second, fourth and seventh grade Hispanic-Latino children who had exited bilingual
blank         | 
text          | education programs in their schools and joined the English-only instructional programs,
blank         | 
text          | the study compared oral questionnaire responses regarding the amount that children
blank         | 
text          | watched television (the language of programming was not determined or was assumed to
blank         | 
text          | be English) with children’s test language proficiency and reading scores. Results showed
blank         | 
text          | a positive relationship between television viewing and reading scores, however the author
blank         | 
text          | notes that unexpectedly, the relationship between reading scores and television watching
blank         | 
text          | was highest for children with higher levels of English language proficiency. Blosser
blank         | 
text          | suggests that perhaps the children with lower English proficiency skills were not able to
blank         | 
text          | access enough meaning from television content in English and thus were not able to
blank         | 
text          | benefit from it in terms of language or literacy learning. The author reasons that language
blank         | 
text          | in television programs may have been less comprehensible for children at the lower
blank         | 
text          | English proficiency levels, and thus less effective in aiding second language acquisition.
blank         | 
text          | The study also showed an unexpected effect of the time of day children were watching
blank         | 
text          | television, with afternoon and evening watching being more positively correlated with
blank         | 
text          | reading scores. The author suggests that this pattern could be due to programs broadcast in
blank         | 
text          | the after-school and evening hours, which were more child- and family-oriented.

blank         | 
text          | combinations of (audio)visual information and text. In an experimental study, Neuman
blank         | 
text          | and Koskinen (1992) tested the ways that the audiovisual cues of television as well as
blank         | 
text          | textual support related to vocabulary gains. The study participants were low-income,
blank         | 
text          | language-minority, largely Southeast Asian-origin seventh- and eighth-graders who
blank         | 
text          | attended bilingual science class in their L1, and were assigned to one of four conditions.
blank         | 
text          | One group of students watched educational television shows with captioning, a second
blank         | 
text          | group watched the same shows without captioning, a third group listened to the audio of
blank         | 
text          | the shows and followed along with the written text, and a fourth group read textbooks
blank         | 
text          | only. The study found that students who had watched captioned television made
blank         | 
text          | significantly more gains than students in the other groups. These findings, and the authors’
blank         | 
text          | analyses to identify which words were being learned and from which parts of the shows,
blank         | 
text          | indicate that the contextual support offered by audio, visual and text together were
blank         | 
text          | contributing positively to vocabulary gains. The authors note that, echoing Blosser’s
blank         | 
text          | (1988) findings somewhat, students who already had higher levels of proficiency in
blank         | 
text          | English learned more from the captioned television than students with lower proficiency,
blank         | 
text          | and the authors suggest that a certain “threshold” of comprehension may have been
blank         | 
text          | necessary in order for the input to be comprehensible enough to enable vocabulary
blank         | 
text          | acquisition.
blank         | 
text          |           Studies of English learners in Europe have found positive relationships between
blank         | 
text          | English language scores and time students spend watching media with subtitles in the L1
blank         | 
text          | – in contrast to Neuman and Koskinen’s use of same-language captions (1992). Kuppens
blank         | 
text          | (2010) found that students’ use of English language media with subtitles (in the L1) over

blank         | 
text          | children learning English, Kuppens found that watching three specific English-language
blank         | 
text          | media programs with subtitles was significantly linked to higher scores on tests of English
blank         | 
text          | proficiency. The study also found that playing English video games also positively
blank         | 
text          | influenced scores on the English language assessments. Although this research did not
blank         | 
text          | focus on immigrants per sé, it is significant in that it takes into account students’ media
blank         | 
text          | use over a long-term period.
blank         | 
text          |           Much of the literature on mass media and immigrant children measures
blank         | 
text          | “acculturation,” defined in a number of ways depending on the researcher’s conceptual
blank         | 
text          | framework, rather than language itself, and few of these studies focus on children. In one
blank         | 
text          | relevant study, Zohoori’s (1988) compared survey responses of “foreign” children
blank         | 
text          | (children born outside the United States whose parents were not US citizens or permanent
blank         | 
text          | residents) and “U.S.” children (children born in the United States whose parents were U.S.
blank         | 
text          | citizens), all of whom were six to twelve years of age, and found several differences in the
blank         | 
text          | motivations and types of U.S. television use between the two groups. The study found that
blank         | 
text          | foreign children showed relatively more interest in television programs, spent more time
blank         | 
text          | watching television, more frequently identified with television characters, and expressed
blank         | 
text          | greater belief in the social reality portrayed by television. The children who had been in
blank         | 
text          | the US for shorter lengths of time, showed the greatest differences on these measures.

blank         | 
text          | language and writing skills. The advent of affordable Internet-connected mobile devices
blank         | 
text          | has also led to recent experiments in education for English learners within school settings.
blank         | 
text          | Case studies of mobile technologies given to English language learners, who used these
blank         | 
text          | devices for learning across home and school settings, have been shown to inject new
blank         | 
text          | opportunities for students. Min Liu and colleagues, in their multiple-case study of mobile
blank         | 
text          | technology interventions at the elementary, middle school and high school level discuss
blank         | 
text          | the benefits of mobile devices for instruction including flexibility and accessibility (the
blank         | 
text          | ability to use the devices across home, school field trip and other settings), interactivity,
blank         | 
text          | and motivation and engagement (Liu, Navarrete, Maradiegue & Wivagg, 2014). They
blank         | 
text          | also point out the disadvantages, particularly in terms of managing mobile use in the
blank         | 
text          | classroom and maintaining a focus on learning rather than on entertainment alone. These
blank         | 
text          | case studies investigate an intervention in a Texas public school district where iPod touch
blank         | 
text          | devices were given to all ELLs (students designated as English Language Learners, ninety
blank         | 
text          | per cent of them native Spanish speakers). The elementary school teachers in the study
blank         | 
text          | reported how iPads facilitated several activities including exploring words (using
blank         | 
text          | electronic dictionaries that “speak” word pronunciations), creating digital stories out of
blank         | 
text          | field trip experiences and student-led research where students enjoyed being able to locate
blank         | 
text          | and share information on topics of interest. “They love it when I don’t know something
blank         | 
text          | and they get to teach me,” reported one teacher in the study (p. 172).

text          |           The potential of the Internet and other digital technologies for adult language

blank         | 
text          | strengthening adult language and literacy learning through five main categories of activity
blank         | 
text          | that include multimodal communication (using audio and video production tools),

text          | collaborative writing, language analysis and structure, online networking and one-to-one
blank         | 
text          | and mobile computing. This literature generally addresses classroom instruction rather
blank         | 
text          | than learning at home or in informal settings. However it raises the question of how
blank         | 
text          | currently available technologies deemed useful in classrooms could also apply in homes
blank         | 
text          | and other settings.
blank         | 
text          |           In the context of family media use, Tripp (2011) found in a study of families with
blank         | 
text          | adolescents that parents in Latino immigrant households may exhibit more restrictive and
blank         | 
text          | controlling behavior with so-called “new” media. Many parents are not familiar with
blank         | 
text          | digital media environments and thus are concerned about their children going online and
blank         | 
text          | accessing inappropriate content. However, as Vaala (2013) points out, this attitude does
blank         | 
text          | not extend to broadcast or traditional media with which parents feel more in control, such
blank         | 
text          | as television, and children are allowed to spend large amounts of time watching, including
blank         | 
text          | time watching together as a family (Tripp, 2011; Takeuchi, 2011). Research on Hispanic-
blank         | 
text          | Latino families and media does reflect the strong role that television and particularly
blank         | 
text          | programming produced for Latino viewers has taken on. Research on children and
blank         | 
text          | “ethnic media” has focused largely on identity, pointing to the ways these programs
blank         | 
text          | differentiate the home media environments of Hispanic-Latino children from majority
blank         | 
text          | culture children. For example, Mayer’s (2003) two-year ethnography of Mexican-

blank         | 
text          |            Children and adolescents in immigrant families often take on important roles as
blank         | 
text          | translators that facilitate adults’ access to various types of publications, services and
blank         | 
text          | information. Katz (2010; 2014) explores the role of older children as “media brokers” that
blank         | 
text          | provide a primary link to local resources and information that helps parents make
blank         | 
text          | decisions and determine who to trust. Older children, who are often more proficient in
blank         | 
text          | English than their parents or other adult relatives, use the Internet in a variety of ways
blank         | 
text          | depending on aspects of household infrastructure, including devices owned, the physical
blank         | 
text          | setup of the home and social arrangements. Despite the integral part played by children in
blank         | 
text          | her (2010) study, Katz also reported practices of joint sense making, where children
blank         | 
text          | employed their language and media literacy skills, but adults complemented these with

text          | their more advanced understanding of the world (for example, a child translating a news
blank         | 
text          | story and her parent in turn explaining its significance). Studies such as these echo
blank         | 
text          | Jimenez’ (2003) and others’ argument that immigrant children develop and perfect many
blank         | 
text          | forms of literacy that may or may not be detected or valued by the mainstream school
blank         | 
text          | system. Thus, while children in Hispanic-Latino immigrant families may be developing a
blank         | 
text          | variety of meaningful skills with language, these achievements are not necessarily aligned
blank         | 
text          | with school curricula and may not translating into academic success for these students.

text          |            At the same time research has suggested that children’s “brokering” in general for

blank         | 
text          | between children’s language brokering and test scores – children who engaged in more
blank         | 
text          | language brokering had significantly better performance on fifth- and sixth-grade reading
blank         | 
text          | assessments. However, other research has suggested that in addition to some benefits,
blank         | 
text          | brokering may have negative outcomes in some cases, such as taking children’s attention
blank         | 
text          | away from schoolwork (Katz, 2014). The research on media brokering itself focuses on
blank         | 
text          | older children and adolescents, and there has been less attention to exactly how media
blank         | 
text          | brokering begins.
blank         | 
text          |            Recent ethnographic research by Schwartz & Gutiérrez (forthcoming) shares
blank         | 
text          | an example of how family dynamics influence media activities and ways that particular
blank         | 
text          | family members act as brokers or hubs of technology access. In their detailed case study
blank         | 
text          | of one Hispanic-Latino, mostly English-speaking family, the authors highlight the
blank         | 
text          | importance of the social organization at home and specific actors – in this case, the mother
blank         | 
text          | who managed and provided access to her smartphone among her children while at the
blank         | 
text          | same time establishing important boundaries and practices for her children’s activities
blank         | 
text          | with the phone. By following the children across settings and observing their technology
blank         | 
text          | activities at an after-school program as well, the authors identified ways that the mother’s
blank         | 
text          | teaching and brokering of technology was reflected in her daughters’ learning activities
blank         | 
text          | outside the home. Thus while family dynamics and roles may be quite different in other
blank         | 
text          | families, particularly families with recently immigrated parents that are learning English,
blank         | 
text          | this example of in-depth research shows the importance of highlighting the social
blank         | 
text          | structure of the family as it shapes media use and learning practices.

text          |           As a whole the literature on media and language learning is consistent with the
blank         | 
text          | idea that while media alone cannot effectively teach all aspects of language, it can
blank         | 
text          | contribute in significant and positive ways as part of a broader ecology of “real world”
blank         | 
text          | interactions and language and literacy-related activities. Research should not be
blank         | 
text          | interpreted as advocating for replacing human interaction with screen time, rather, it
blank         | 
text          | illuminates the various ways that media can bolster, enhance and add dimensions to
blank         | 
text          | learning and development. Research regarding particularities that may exist within
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino immigrant households point to important considerations regarding
blank         | 
text          | attitudes, ways of leveraging tools and the social arrangements around media. However,
blank         | 
text          | studies in family homes do not generally focus on language and literacy experiences or
blank         | 
text          | discuss how the observed media practices might be related to this area of development.

blank         | 
text          |           Research focused on Hispanic-Latino immigrant families points in large part to
blank         | 
text          | relationships between home practices and school expectations including “home-school
blank         | 
text          | discontinuities” that become problematic early on and can set off a pattern of academic
blank         | 
text          | failure and disengagement that persists into their middle- and high school years (e.g.
blank         | 
text          | Valdés, 1996, Reese & Gallimore, 2000). Disentangling these patterns, studies of
blank         | 
text          | language learning among low-income, language minority Latino families (not specific to
blank         | 
text          | learning with media) have stressed the importance of considering the particular social and
blank         | 
text          | cultural practices of families when designing and implementing interventions. Valdés’
blank         | 
text          | (1996) detailed three-year ethnography of ten Mexican-origin families in the
blank         | 
text          | Southwestern U.S. sheds light on the ways in which traditional family and child-rearing

blank         | 
text          | Valdés argues, serve their own important purpose in the family’s survival as a unit,
blank         | 
text          | however they also very often clash with the expectations of mainstream school culture.
blank         | 
text          | Valdés reveals via rich examples how efforts that seek to help children and their families
blank         | 
text          | succeed often fail, due to a lack of understanding of this disconnect.
blank         | 
text          |           Goldenberg, Gallimore and Reese (2005) explore these discontinuities by using
blank         | 
text          | mixed methods and examining daily family routines as the unit of analysis. Based on
blank         | 
text          | their findings, the authors suggest that the true sources of home-school discontinuities are
blank         | 
text          | not – as some previous authors intimated – due to low value placed on schooling by
blank         | 
text          | Latino parents or lack of understanding of how success works. Goldenberg et al. instead
blank         | 
text          | argue that it is not the parents’ values or goals that diverge from the mainstream; in fact
blank         | 
text          | most Latino families share the same desires for their children to do well in school as do
blank         | 
text          | teachers and middle-class families. Rather, it is children’s literacy experiences at home
blank         | 
text          | that may help reveal the underpinnings for some discontinuities. Using a variety of
blank         | 
text          | methods such as open-ended interviews, ethnographic observations, literacy testing,
blank         | 
text          | standardized test results and teacher and parent ratings, the authors identify a cultural
blank         | 
text          | model by which parents’ literacy activities with children at home are related to – among
blank         | 
text          | other factors – parents’ own experiences with schooling and literacy development in their
blank         | 
text          | home countries. The authors also emphasize that within the Latino immigrant population
blank         | 
text          | there is considerable diversity. Grandparents’ level of education, family origins in rural or
blank         | 
text          | urban areas and preschool attendance by the child, for example, accounted for substantial
blank         | 
text          | variability in children’s literacy and oral fluency in English several years down the line.

text          |           At the same time as they reveal parents’ cultural model of literacy development,
blank         | 
text          | Reese and Gallimore (2005) also point out that these models are not always etched in
blank         | 
text          | stone and may evolve and change across generations or an individual’s life: “…parents'
blank         | 
text          | literacy practices and beliefs do not simply mirror those of their own parents and their
blank         | 
text          | childhood. Despite the existence of a shared model of literacy development, families
blank         | 
text          | respond to new challenges or demands in the environments in which they find themselves”
blank         | 
text          | (p. 121). Applying this concept to the context of changing technology tools and access,
blank         | 
text          | the dynamic view of parents’ frameworks is particularly important to consider. Most
blank         | 
text          | parents of young children today did not grow up in a world with smartphones, tablets or
blank         | 
text          | for many even the Internet. The parents who participated in this dissertation study were
blank         | 
text          | frequent users of technologies that were not been present during their upbringing.
blank         | 
text          | Today’s rapidly changing technology landscape poses “new challenges or demands” for
blank         | 
text          | people to adapt to new technologies, and how they choose to take up these tools becomes
blank         | 
text          | the focus of attention here. In addition, following Valdés’ (1996) emphasis on
blank         | 
text          | understanding social and cultural context, investigating the aspect of media use in family
blank         | 
text          | homes has the potential to shed light on home practices that in turn shape outcomes in
blank         | 
text          | schools or other settings.
blank         | 
text          |    Although research efforts on joint media use and media engagement among Hispanic-
blank         | 
text          | Latino families are only beginning, there is a larger body of literature on parent-child
blank         | 
text          | storybook reading practices that can provide background as well. Though books and other
blank         | 
text          | “old media” provide a different experience (visual, tactile, etc.) from digital or broadcast
blank         | 
text          | media, they are also centerpieces for parent-child interaction and for children’s
blank         | 
text          | development of early language and literacy skills. Unlike joint media engagement, “book

text          | sharing” (joint reading) is widely encouraged by schools and parenting experts as a means
blank         | 
text          | of bolstering children’s progress with language and literacy. However, specific practices
blank         | 
text          | of book sharing vary across settings, cultures and families. In addition, while the ideal
blank         | 
text          | role of media in children’s lives is still being debated, parent-child book reading is
blank         | 
text          | traditionally valued in U.S. mainstream culture, although many minority-culture families
blank         | 
text          | may not engage regularly in it for a variety of reasons (e.g. Valdés, 1996) or may believe
blank         | 
text          | that only children above a certain age benefit from being read to (Reese & Gallimore,
blank         | 
text          | 2000).
blank         | 
text          |           Researchers have identified ways in which parents’ reading or book sharing styles
blank         | 
text          | are linked to language and literacy development (Fletcher & Reese, 2005; Whitehurst &
blank         | 
text          | Lonigan, 1998), however conclusions regarding best practices for joint reading are mixed
blank         | 
text          | and inconsistent. In their study of parents’ storybook reading to young children,
blank         | 
text          | Whitehurst, Falco, Lonigan, Valdez-Menchaca, and Caulfield (1988) instructed parents in
blank         | 
text          | an experimental group to ask more open-ended questions, be responsive to children’s
blank         | 
text          | attempts to answer, and reduce straight reading and questions that can be answered by
blank         | 
text          | pointing. The children whose parents received this instruction showed more advanced
blank         | 
text          | language use than control children, including higher levels of expressive language, longer
blank         | 
text          | average language utterances and less single word usage. However, in a short-term
blank         | 
text          | longitudinal study, Caspe (2009) studied Hispanic mother-child pairs and found that
blank         | 
text          | children whose mothers used a “storybuilder-labeler” style – the style that most closely
blank         | 
text          | resembles the question asking, prompting and co-constructing found to be beneficial in the
blank         | 
text          | previously mentioned study (Whitehurst et al., 1988) actually had lower literacy scores
blank         | 
text          | than children whose mothers used a “storyteller” style (telling child a story without asking

blank         | 
text          | difficult given that the storybooks used are different and may not represent what or how
blank         | 
text          | each pair is accustomed to reading at home.
blank         | 
text          |    How can what we know about traditional joint storybook reading help inform best
blank         | 
text          | practices of joint media engagement? There is some evidence to suggest that parents and
blank         | 
text          | children interact in similar ways around print storybooks and some analogous media
blank         | 
text          | programs such as online storybooks. Fisch (2002) compared groups of parent-child dyads
blank         | 
text          | as they read either a traditional or online storybook, and found that many of the behaviors,
blank         | 
text          | levels of abstraction in utterances, and agency of the child were the same. However, other
blank         | 
text          | studies suggest differences in how print and electronic books support emergent literacy. In
blank         | 
text          | one study, de Jong and Bus (2002) found in a comparison of groups reading print and
blank         | 
text          | ebooks that print books were more supportive of children’s learning about the content than
blank         | 
text          | were ebooks, and that both forms supported learning about features of written words
blank         | 
text          | comparably. Chiong, Ree and Takeuchi (2012) carried out a more nuanced study that
blank         | 
text          | included both “basic” and “enhanced” ebooks as well as print books. In their study,
blank         | 
text          | children remembered less about narrative content if they engaged with enhanced ebooks
blank         | 
text          | instead of print books or basic ebooks. However, the authors note the value of enhanced
blank         | 
text          | ebooks for engaging the attention of children.
blank         | 
text          |    Social context and support is also essential in considering the role and effect of
blank         | 
text          | reading ebooks. In a recent synthetic review of the research on e-reading with young
blank         | 
text          | children, Miller and Warschauer (2013) posit that classroom-based studies have yielded
blank         | 
text          | encouraging results – provided they are well integrated with the proper context, choice of
blank         | 
text          | ebooks and pedagogical approach – however results from home studies show more mixed

text          | results. As the authors point out, there is a particular need for studies of ebooks in the
blank         | 
text          | home environment, given that the percentage of children who have read ebooks nearly
blank         | 
text          | doubled from 2010 to 2013 and three-quarters of children who had read ebooks had done
blank         | 
text          | so at home (Scholastic, 2013, as cited in Miller & Warschauer, 2013). Research outside
blank         | 
text          | the classroom such as the Parish-Morris et al. (2013) study detailed above sometimes
blank         | 
text          | suggest that print books are more favorable than ebooks for certain aspects of literacy
blank         | 
text          | development. However, Miller and Warschauer point out that ebooks and print books
blank         | 
text          | need not be viewed in opposition to one another. In both classroom and home settings,
blank         | 
text          | ebooks had been seen as an addition or supplement to print books, not a replacement.
blank         | 
text          |    In sum, it appears based on this review of prior research that print-based
              |    resources and e-books are neither mutually exclusive, nor is technology a substitute
              |    for print. Rather traditional print books and e-books seem to play different
              |    roles in the literacy process, and eliminating this false dichotomy offers
              |    children more opportunity for diverse types of literacy experiences. (p.12)
blank         | 
text          | Several of the studies reviewed also described the particular features of specific ebooks,
blank         | 
text          | such as dictionaries and the ability to have a word spoken by tapping it. These and many
blank         | 
text          | other aspects of ebooks, the review authors argue, can add dimensions to the affordances
blank         | 
text          | already present in print books, enriching literacy learning rather than necessarily altering it
blank         | 
text          | irrecognizably.

text          |    It is important to note that the above studies comparing traditional versus ebooks do
blank         | 
text          | not analyze results in relationship to children’s reading level or linguistic background. By
blank         | 
text          | contrast, Bus, Verhallen and de Jong (2009) exposed children who were learning Dutch as
blank         | 
text          | a second language – and were scoring on the low end in literacy assessments – to two
blank         | 
text          | types of ebooks. One ebook was “static,” in that it was a sequence of pages with an audio
blank         | 
text          | telling of the story speaking along. The other “rich” electronic books included video and
blank         | 
text          | graphic enhancements that illustrated words and enriched meaning-making (not

text          | “peripheral” enhancements that distracted from the words and story). In contrast with
blank         | 
text          | some of the studies described above, the children engaged with the books alone, without
blank         | 
text          | adult guidance. In this study, where children were in the process of learning the language
blank         | 
text          | and not yet familiar with many of the words presented, the participants learned more
blank         | 
text          | words and understood more about the story after sessions with the enhanced ebooks than
blank         | 
text          | sessions with the static ebooks. The authors repeated the methodology with a linguistically
blank         | 
text          | advantaged sample, and found no differences between the results of reading the different
blank         | 
text          | types of ebooks. Based on these results, the authors suggest that audiovisual
blank         | 
text          | enhancements may be helpful to learners with a lower level of language understanding in
blank         | 
text          | ways that are not significant to learners who have more command of the language. These
blank         | 
text          | studies support the need to better understand how second language learners might benefit
blank         | 
text          | uniquely from multimedia resources.

title         | Brief Summary of the Review
blank         | 
text          |    To conclude this review of the literature, there is still much that is not known about
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino families with young children and the kinds of media and technology
blank         | 
text          | activities they engage in at home. We know based on large-scale survey research that
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latinos in the U.S. are adopting technologies rapidly. Research has identified
blank         | 
text          | the need to support Hispanic-Latino children and families based on education-related
blank         | 
text          | challenges they face, and parents in these families do place a high value on their
blank         | 
text          | children’s education. Several lines of research have shown promise and opportunity for
blank         | 
text          | media and technology to contribute to learning in general, and to language and literacy
blank         | 
text          | experiences for children who are dual language learners. Although media and technology

              |

text          | alone may not be adequate to teach language or literacy skills, these resources have been
blank         | 
text          | shown to contribute positively to development in these areas both generally and for
blank         | 
text          | language minority children. Some technologies, such as ebooks with multimedia features,
blank         | 
text          | appear to benefit second language learners in ways they don’t benefit those reading in
blank         | 
text          | their native language. Studies have also suggested that children from immigrant families
blank         | 
text          | are especially interested in and enthusiastic about media in their “host country.”
blank         | 
text          |               The piece that is most lacking in the literature is in-depth research that is
blank         | 
text          | carried out in naturalistic settings and can identify 1). what media content Hispanic-Latino
blank         | 
text          | immigrant families are using, 2.) how they use this content and 3.) how these media
blank         | 
text          | activities might relate to their learning. Although media use might potentially influence
blank         | 
text          | various areas of learning, in the context of language minority families it is of particular
blank         | 
text          | interest to identify what language and literacy experiences families are having with media
blank         | 
text          | activities.

title         | Research Questions
blank         | 
text          |            In order to begin to understand Hispanic-Latino families’ media activities at
blank         | 
text          | home in a way that takes into account multiple factors such as access, content, language
blank         | 
text          | and the social context surrounding media use, this dissertation study addresses three core
blank         | 
text          | questions:
blank         | 
              | 
text          |            1. What language and literacy experiences does media provide or facilitate for
              |            children who are developing as dual language learners and for parents who are
              |            also learning English?

              |     	  
text          |             2. What language- and literacy-related media practices and activities do families
              |             engage in, either solo or together, as part of their daily routines?
blank         | 
text          |             3. What family dynamics and practices develop around a newly introduced
              |             tablet device loaded with a small set of high quality literacy and language
              |             resources?
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Theoretical Framework
blank         | 
text          | To address the question above, I use a socio-cultural framework with a focus on how and
blank         | 
text          | when families use media together to foster collaborative, intergenerational learning
blank         | 
text          | (Rogoff, 2003), as well as individuals’ solo interactions with media that may relate to
blank         | 
text          | learning.
blank         | 
text          |             Whereas many studies of “media use” focus on devices owned, quantifications
blank         | 
text          | of screen time or the presence of Internet access, this study moves beyond simple
blank         | 
text          | measures and inventories to shed light on how Latino immigrant families in the United
blank         | 
text          | States whose primary home language is not English use media, and what role media plays
blank         | 
text          | in family interactions and English language learning. To do this, I rely on some core
blank         | 
text          | theoretical perspectives.
blank         | 
text          |             First, this study is grounded in a sociocultural perspective (Rogoff, 2003;
blank         | 
text          | Vygotsky, 1986) that recognizes the primary importance of social interactions for
blank         | 
text          | understanding human development, and conceptualizes human development as a cultural
blank         | 
text          | process. In this vein, my work is deeply influenced by ethnographic and design-based
blank         | 
text          | research in the area of Latino students learning English (Valdés, 1996, 1998; Valdés,
blank         | 
text          | Capitelli & Álvarez, 2011) and research on learning environments designed to foster
blank         | 
text          | language and literacy development in young children in ways that draw upon their cultural
blank         | 
text          | and linguistic backgrounds (e.g. Gutierrez et al, 2011). In this study, I use the lens of
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
footer        |                                                  35	  
blank         |    	  
              |    	  
text          | “repertoires of practice” (Gutierrez & Rogoff, 2003) as part of an effort to document “the
blank         | 
text          | histories and valued practices of cultural groups” (p. 20) as suggested by those authors,
blank         | 
text          | that can lead to a better understanding of approaches to learning among people (as
blank         | 
text          | opposed to approaching them from a standpoint of differences from the “majority” or in a
blank         | 
text          | deficit model). Gutiérrez and Schwartz (2013; forthcoming) extend this framing to
blank         | 
text          | practices with media and technology with the term inventos, also invoking McDermott &
blank         | 
text          | Raley’s (2011) theme ingenuity – the inventive solutions that emerge under constraint.
blank         | 
text          |           Second, in order to address issues of how families may learn language via media
blank         | 
text          | activities, it is also necessary to identify a guiding framework for language acquisition.
blank         | 
text          | Although this study does not engage in fine-grain linguistic analysis, it is oriented by
blank         | 
text          | sociocultural and sociointeractionist perspectives on language acquisition, theories that
blank         | 
text          | make up the so-called “social turn” in the field, explored from several perspectives in
blank         | 
text          | Ortega’s (2009) overview of “Social dimensions of L2 learning.” Reviews of the SLA
blank         | 
text          | literature (Zuengler & Miller, 2006; Valdés, 2011; Meltzoff, Kuhl, Movellan & Sejnowski,
blank         | 
text          | 2009) have noted that the field has generated two different – some argue, irreconcilable –
blank         | 
text          | strands: the more recent sociointeractionist approach, mentioned above, and the longer-
blank         | 
text          | standing cognitivist approach. The cognitivist approach, widely seen as the “mainstream"
blank         | 
text          | perspective, views SLA overall as an internal mental process within the learner’s mind
blank         | 
text          | and that should be common to most or all learners of an L2 in different contexts (e.g.
blank         | 
text          | Krashen, 1985; Gass, 1997). In contrast, the sociointeractionist perspective
blank         | 
text          | conceptualizes SLA as a inevitably a product of interactions between learners and other
blank         | 
text          | users of the target language, and therefore more complex and linked to context. This
blank         | 
text          | study conceptualizes second language acquisition from a sociocultural or
blank         | 
              |

              |

              |    	  
text          | sociointeractionist perspective (e.g. Firth & Wagner, 1997), which includes theories
blank         | 
text          | drawn from Vygotskian principles (e.g. Frawley & Lantolf, 1985; Lantolf, 2000; Lantolf
blank         | 
text          | & Thorne, 2006) and language socialization theory (e.g. Ochs & Schiefflin, 1984; Duff,
blank         | 
text          | 2007). From a broad perspective, these theories all extend many of the same sociocultural
blank         | 
text          | principles applied to human development to second language acquisition, viewing it as a
blank         | 
text          | nonlinear process that is powerfully shaped by social interactions and dynamics. The
blank         | 
text          | most important overall aspect of the social approach to SLA is that it recognizes that
blank         | 
text          | language learning is “not only shaped by the social context in which it happens; it is
blank         | 
text          | bound inextricably to such context” (Ortega, 2009, p. 217). In addition the
blank         | 
text          | sociointeractionist view places emphasis on the many ways that individuals may become
blank         | 
text          | users of the L2, as opposed to being either learners or native-level speakers.
blank         | 
text          |           Third, this research draws on the learning ecologies framework (Barron, 2004;
blank         | 
text          | 2006), which emphasizes the role of learning activities that are distributed across multiple
blank         | 
text          | settings and the closely intertwined relationship between individual and context in
blank         | 
text          | learning and development. Barron (2004) defines the term “learning ecology” as
blank         | 
text          | “accessed set of contexts, comprised of configurations of activities, material resources and
blank         | 
text          | relationships, found in co-located physical or virtual spaces that provide opportunities for
blank         | 
text          | learning” (p. 6), thus including content accessed digitally in the range of contributing
blank         | 
text          | resources. Another central piece of this framework is the role of the child in creating
blank         | 
text          | opportunities to learn within and across setting. Barron (2006) shows how children’s
blank         | 
text          | interests drive this creation of opportunity, and highlights the roles of technology that
blank         | 
text          | allow children and families to access resources. The learning ecologies framework builds
blank         | 
text          | on Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) foundational work on ecological perspectives and the
blank         |

              |    	  
text          | importance of considering the many settings and interactions that influence development
blank         | 
text          | in general. In keeping with this background, this dissertation study is designed to look
blank         | 
text          | across settings and interactions, including media use itself, asynchronous interactions
blank         | 
text          | related to the media content that may happen at different times and places, and the variety
blank         | 
text          | of actors and relationships that together contribute to learning and development. This
blank         | 
text          | approach also influences and is reflected in the literature on joint media engagement
blank         | 
text          | (JME) cited in the above review. Joint media engagement among families can refer to
blank         | 
text          | interactions that happen while people are interacting with media together, or
blank         | 
text          | “asynchronously,” as when a family discusses a media program during dinnertime. At the
blank         | 
text          | same time, the focus on the social context of media use is meant to consider and situate
blank         | 
text          | media activities within the constellation of relationships and interactions in family life. It
blank         | 
text          | is not intended to insinuate that parents should be using media along with their children at
blank         | 
text          | all times.
blank         | 
text          |              Finally, this study takes the point of view that any medium is a neutral vehicle
blank         | 
text          | and cannot be categorically deemed “good” or “bad” for children or for people in general.
blank         | 
text          | Rather, what will matter are the content choices that children, families, media producers
blank         | 
text          | and educators make and the interactions that occur as they are creating and using media.
blank         | 
text          | As such, more research is needed to inform the design that fosters learning and positive
blank         | 
text          | family media engagement, as well as recommend strategies for families to most
blank         | 
text          | productively engage with media that is already available.

title         | Brief Overview of the Dissertation
blank         | 
text          |    In the following chapters, I set out to answer the three research questions above using
blank         | 
text          | the following structure.
blank         | 
text          |    Chapter One lays out the research background and theoretical framework for the study,
blank         | 
text          | drawing upon several distinct literatures.
blank         | 
text          |    Chapter Two describes the methods used for data collection and analysis, as well as
blank         | 
text          | basic data on the participants recruited.
blank         | 
text          |    Chapter Three is made up of introductory portraits of each of the seven case families,
blank         | 
text          | which include sections on family background, local support networks and home
blank         | 
text          | infrastructure and media routines.
blank         | 
text          |    In Chapters Four, Five, Six and Seven I present the data that specifically addresses the
blank         | 
text          | three research questions listed at the start of this section. Chapters Four, Five and Six
blank         | 
text          | focus on the families’ media activities and media-related language- and literacy
blank         | 
text          | experiences that were present in the first half of the six-month data collection period (prior
blank         | 
text          | to introducing the iPads), as well as practices after that that were not related to or pre-
blank         | 
text          | dated the iPad intervention. Chapter Seven focuses on the role of the iPad, the activities
blank         | 
text          | and practices that developed in relationship to the device, all during the second half (latter
blank         | 
text          | three months) of data collection.2
blank         | 
text          |    I chose to organize the data around broad themes related to language and literacy
blank         | 
text          | experiences that emerged from the data –uses of media for “knowledge seeking,” or

title         | Overview of Findings
blank         | 
text          |    The following points offer a high-level summary of major findings in each chapter:
blank         | 
text          |    1. Prior to the iPad intervention, family media practices among these seven Hispanic-
blank         | 
text          |           Latino immigrant families were diverse and included resourceful and intentional
blank         | 
text          |           strategies for using media to access information and instruction. Families
blank         | 
text          |           leveraged Internet tools for learning in a variety of sophisticated ways, using
blank         | 
text          |           online video (YouTube) and translator apps for accessing a variety of information.
blank         | 
text          |           Some of these media practices facilitated connections between home and school

text          |        learning, supported parents in their own studies and careers, and/or facilitated
blank         | 
text          |        interest-driven learning.
blank         | 
text          | 2. All families’ media routines included content in both Spanish and English, and
blank         | 
text          |        parents felt contributed to their children’s language and literacy development as
blank         | 
text          |        well as to their own. For all case families media was a substantial part of the daily
blank         | 
text          |        routine, included content in both Spanish and English, and was seen by parents as
blank         | 
text          |        a contributor to children’s English learning.
blank         | 
text          | 3.     The impact of iPads was highly linked to the content installed on them. This
blank         | 
text          |        content led to some new language- and literacy-related media practices including
blank         | 
text          |        child-led, interest-driven learning, and at the same time families also used the
blank         | 
text          |        iPads for previously established media activities. New language- and literacy-
blank         | 
text          |        related practices prompted by the iPads – or more specifically the apps installed on
blank         | 
text          |        the iPads – included ebook reading (by children alone and with parents) and use of
blank         | 
text          |        creative storytelling tools. Not all practices with the iPads were new however, –
blank         | 
text          |        family members also applied pre-established media practices to these new devices.
blank         | 
text          |        In this way, the iPads themselves were influential in facilitating new language- and
blank         | 
text          |        literacy-related activities because they were equipped with language- and literacy-
blank         | 
text          |        related apps – content that parents were not aware of prior to the study. This
blank         | 
text          |        finding suggests that where access to devices may no longer be as great of a
blank         | 
text          |        challenge, knowledge of how to locate and access high quality educational apps
blank         | 
text          |        may not be easy to attain.
blank         | 
text          | 4. Families’ routines and practices around choosing technologies and content were
blank         | 
text          |        highly social – Relatives and broader social networks were important motivators

blank         | 
text          |        Connecting with families’ country of origin was a primary role that media played
blank         | 
text          |        in families’ lives.
blank         | 
text          | 5. There was evidence that joint and/or collaborative language learning could and did
blank         | 
text          |        occur between parents and children using media. Parents reported having learned
blank         | 
text          |        some English from watching TV or video with their children, and some parents
blank         | 
text          |        used ebook reading on the iPads as a way to improve their English. However,
blank         | 
text          |        media content was an important factor in inviting co-engagement by parents.
blank         | 
text          | 6. Currently there are few digital resources designed for Hispanic-Latino immigrant
blank         | 
text          |        families or that uniquely suit their needs. This presents a design opportunity for
blank         | 
text          |        future tools to support this population.

title         |    Study Design
blank         | 
text          |           It became clear in the process of researching this topic that there is little literature
blank         | 
text          |    available that addresses Hispanic-Latino families’ home practices with any emphasis on
blank         | 
text          |    media use, much less current research that includes the media platforms available today.
blank         | 
text          |    To begin to paint a clear picture of these practices and get at the answers to the research
blank         | 
text          |    questions I had set out, multiple sources of information would be needed. I chose a mixed-
blank         | 
text          |    methods approach in order to capture rich qualitative data as well as quantitative survey
blank         | 
text          |    data that could be mapped on to a larger population. The study methodology consists of the
blank         | 
text          |    following major components:
blank         | 
text          | 1. Ethnographic case studies of families based on all six months of qualitative data
blank         | 
text          |    collection;
blank         | 
text          | 2. A tablet intervention that provided families with their own iPad tablet computer, starting
blank         | 
text          |    halfway through the six-month data collection period, which subsequently became part of
blank         | 
text          |    the ethnographic observations and interviews. Each iPad was equipped with a selection of
blank         | 
text          |    applications related to language and literacy learning, and an app that collected quantitative
blank         | 
text          |    data on families’ app use;
blank         | 
text          | 3. Quantitative survey responses from each family on the Families and Media Survey
blank         | 
text          |    (Rideout, 2014). The data set of responses to the same survey from a nationally-
blank         | 
text          |    representative sample of Hispanic-Latino parents of children 2-10 years old and whose
blank         | 
text          |    primary home language is not English, surveyed by the Joan Ganz Cooney Center, were

text          | I chose to employ qualitative case study methods (Yin, 2003) due to the lack of existing
blank         | 
text          | research on this topic, particularly as regards disruptive media platforms that have recently
blank         | 
text          | emerged such as smartphones and tablet computers. In order to help create a foundation
blank         | 
text          | for research in this area, rich and detailed data is needed to support future research and
blank         | 
text          | theory building. To this end, this research includes an in-depth study of the seven Latino
blank         | 
text          | immigrant families whose primary home language is not English that include five-to-
blank         | 
text          | seven-year-old “focal” children. This age range was chosen in order to capture
blank         | 
text          | experiences of children whose literacy skills are still in relatively early development, and
blank         | 
text          | whose language skills in English may still be developing rapidly.
blank         | 
text          |          The tablet intervention, in which families each received an Apple iPad after
blank         | 
text          | completing the first three months of the study, served a dual purpose. First and foremost,
blank         | 
text          | introducing an iPad loaded with a selection of learning resources allowed for glimpse of
blank         | 
text          | what might be, if access to both the technology and high quality content were provided. It
blank         | 
text          | allows the study to document what role a new device took on in the household, who
blank         | 
text          | benefited most from it and what opportunities, advantages and/or disadvantages it
blank         | 
text          | introduced.
blank         | 
text          |          The design of study procedures are centered around the three core questions
blank         | 
text          | mentioned in the previous chapter:
blank         | 
text          |        1. What language and literacy experiences does media provide or facilitate for
blank         | 
text          |           children who are developing as dual language learners and for parents who are also
blank         | 
text          |           learning English?
blank         | 
text          |        2. What language- and literacy-related media practices and activities do families
blank         | 
text          |           engage in, either solo or together, as part of their daily routines?

text          |          “Hispanic-Latino” is not a homogeneous demographic – quite the contrary. Among
blank         | 
text          | individuals in the United States who identify as Hispanic-Latino, there is enormous
blank         | 
text          | variability in many characteristics including country of origin, ethnic background,
blank         | 
text          | language, socio-economic status, immigration status, education level and culture.
blank         | 
text          | Immigrants who were not born in the United States make up only a subset of the
blank         | 
text          | population that identifies as Hispanic and/or Latino, many of whom come from families
blank         | 
text          | who have been rooted in the United States for two, three or more generations. Even within
blank         | 
text          | families who have immigrated recently, differences in personal history, socio-economic
blank         | 
text          | class and education in the home country create enormous variability.
blank         | 
text          |          For this study, I set out to the following recruitment criteria for families:
blank         | 
text          | 1. Low-income household.
blank         | 
text          | 2. The primary home language is Spanish
blank         | 
text          | 3. Both parents were born and raised in Latin America, having been in this country for
blank         | 
text          |        approximately ten years or less.

blank         | 
text          | These demographic criteria are not meant to discount the great social, ethnic, cultural and
blank         | 
text          | economic diversity of Latino families but are designed to control for some of this variation
blank         | 
text          | and target the SES group whose children are at highest risk to face challenges in school
blank         | 
text          | (Natriello, McDill & Pallas, 1990; Walker, Greenwood, Hart & Carta, 1994), as well as to
blank         | 
text          | document issues that are specific to families where multiple generations are English
blank         | 
text          | language learners. In addition, I selected families in which the children spoke Spanish as
blank         | 
text          | their primary home language, and whose regular and consistent exposure to English was
blank         | 
text          | introduced once they began attending educational settings outside the home. The rationale
blank         | 
text          | behind this criterion was to select for children who might still face challenges learning
blank         | 
text          | English (as compared to children with consistent exposure to English at home).

title         | Recruitment
blank         | 
text          |        I focused my recruitment efforts in one urban area in order to facilitate the multiple
blank         | 
text          | trips needed to visit to participants’ homes each week. While I considered it equally
blank         | 
text          | relevant and interesting to research families living in rural, suburban or urban communities,
blank         | 
text          | I factored convenience and feasibility into my decision of where to recruit. As a parent of a
blank         | 
text          | young child myself, I needed to maintain a balance between data collection and my own
blank         | 
text          | family responsibilities. I thus attempted to minimize the radius within which I traveled to
blank         | 
text          | reach families’ homes, while still remaining within the recruitment criteria and the original
blank         | 
text          | mission of the research.
blank         | 
text          |        I recruited six of the seven participant families via three community-based
blank         | 
text          | organizations in the same city, each of them specialized in working with local parents and

blank         | 
text          | were recruited via snowballing (ultimately the family that recommended them was not
blank         | 
text          | selected). This study required visiting families’ homes regularly over a six-month period,
blank         | 
text          | spending time with their children and asking questions related to home life. Developing

text          | trust and rapport with participants was a key part of the process, and I reasoned that
blank         | 
text          | receiving an introduction from trusted community leaders would help ensure that
blank         | 
text          | participants felt comfortable opening their homes to me, answering my questions and
blank         | 
text          | allowing me to observe their family activities at home. While I also investigated accessing
blank         | 
text          | families via public schools, there were many bureaucratic barriers. Due to the small
blank         | 
text          | number of families I could select, school representatives I spoke with were concerned
blank         | 
text          | about the incentive I was offering (iPads for each family) and that I probably would not be
blank         | 
text          | able to recruit all the qualifying families who wished to participate. Ultimately it was not
blank         | 
text          | necessary to work through schools, since I was conducting the research in homes rather
blank         | 
text          | than at school. This being the case, community-based organizations offered a more direct
blank         | 
text          | way to contact families.
blank         | 
text          |        The two organizations that facilitated my recruiting process offer classes and
blank         | 
text          | workshops for parents in Spanish, and are attended by immigrant families with young
blank         | 
text          | children. One organization had two centers operating within the city, each in a different
blank         | 
text          | neighborhood, and the other was based in a third neighborhood. In each case, I approached
blank         | 
text          | the leaders of the organization, presented my study topic and procedures. The organization
blank         | 
text          | with two locations had separate directors for each site, so I contacted them each
blank         | 
text          | individually. As part of this introduction I explained that I would be offering an iPad for
blank         | 
text          | each family to use as part of the study, and that participants would be able to keep the

blank         | 
text          | were very enthusiastic about the research. They expressed interest in the topic, and were
blank         | 
text          | also eager to connect families with what they saw as a valuable resource (iPads). The
blank         | 
text          | leaders invited me to make a brief presentation during group sessions being held at their
blank         | 
text          | respective programs. One program offers two support groups for Latino families (one at
blank         | 
text          | each of their two locations) and I visited one session per group. The other program works
blank         | 
text          | in partnership with local elementary schools and was launching a training workshop for
blank         | 
text          | parent leaders, where I made my presentation.
blank         | 
text          |        Each of the three meetings I attended was conducted in Spanish and was specifically
blank         | 
text          | designed for Hispanic-Latino parents. In each meeting, the workshop leader (a staff
blank         | 
text          | member of the organization) introduced me and gave me the floor. I handed out a letter
blank         | 
text          | describing my study and also spoke briefly about the study topic, what was required of
blank         | 
text          | participants vis-a-vis time commitment, and so on. In describing the study I specified that
blank         | 
text          | recruited families would each receive an iPad, which would be part of the latter half of the
blank         | 
text          | study and was also a thank-you gift that families would get to keep after the study
blank         | 
text          | concluded. In keeping with the language of the meeting, my presentation was in Spanish,
blank         | 
text          | as was the recruiting letter and sign up list I distributed. As a fluent – though not native –
blank         | 
text          | Spanish speaker and former Spanish teacher, I did not perceive any difficulty
blank         | 
text          | communicating the information to parents or understanding and answering questions.
blank         | 
text          |        Across the three organizations, I received 19 volunteers, of which 14 had children
blank         | 
text          | within age range of five to seven years old. These volunteers included parents who had
blank         | 
text          | added their names and contact information to my sign up list during my presentations, as
blank         | 
text          | well as three parents whom leaders at the organizations referred me to individually. In the

blank         | 
text          | whom they thought might be eligible for and interested in participating. The leaders
blank         | 
text          | showed parents my recruiting letter, and if they were interested in finding out more they
blank         | 
text          | provided their phone numbers so that I could contact them by phone and include them in
blank         | 
text          | the screening process. In addition to these 12, two parents each referred a family, for a
blank         | 
text          | total of 14 candidate families.
blank         | 
text          |        To select participants from the pool of volunteers, I briefly surveyed a parent from
blank         | 
text          | each family by phone and asked basic information regarding education level of the
blank         | 
text          | parent(s), country of origin, primary home language and some questions about the focal
blank         | 
text          | child’s background with regard to English language and consistent exposure to English. I
blank         | 
text          | selected families in a way that represented different focal child ages (five, six and seven
blank         | 
text          | years old) as well as a balance of male and female children. In the phone surveys, I also
blank         | 
text          | inquired about children’s primary language, and selected families in which the focal
blank         | 
text          | child’s primary language was Spanish. I also gave preference to families who did not
blank         | 
text          | already own an iPad (only one recruited family possessed an iPad at the start of the study).
blank         | 
text          |        Once I had made the selection of families, I contacted each family by phone and
blank         | 
text          | scheduled an initial visit where I would present more details on the study, distribute
blank         | 
text          | consent/assent forms and if consent/assent were granted, proceed with the first parent
blank         | 
text          | interview. One family that I had originally selected contacted me by phone and canceled
blank         | 
text          | their participation prior to the initial meeting or reviewing consent materials. All of the
blank         | 
text          | other families that I invited to participate did meet with me in their homes for the initial
blank         | 
text          | visit and consented to participate in the study.

blank         | 
text          |        The families recruited for the study are all residents of a Northern California city and
blank         | 
text          | the children all attend public schools in the same urban school district. The children in the
blank         | 
text          | study all speak Spanish as their primary home language. The children’s regular and
blank         | 
text          | continuous exposure to English began when they entered educational settings outside the
blank         | 
text          | home (preschool, kindergarten and in one case, a daycare). All of the children were
blank         | 
text          | enrolled in dual language (Spanish immersion) programs, with the exception of two
blank         | 
text          | children who whose program was categorized as an English-Spanish “biliteracy” program.
blank         | 
text          | English instruction increased gradually over the course of children’s elementary school
blank         | 
text          | career, and the oldest children in this study were in third grade, meaning that they still
blank         | 
text          | received most or a large part of their instruction in Spanish.
blank         | 
text          |        In terms of education history of parents recruited, in six out of the seven families
blank         | 
text          | parents had completed primary or middle school; two of those parents had also finished
blank         | 
text          | high school and one of them had completed three semesters of college in El Salvador. In
blank         | 
text          | the remaining family, the parents – Lorena and Eduardo Aguirre – were the first generation
blank         | 
text          | in their family to attend university in rural Mexico. However, despite having achieved a
blank         | 
text          | university education in their home country, these parents had not had the opportunity to
blank         | 
text          | pursue careers in their respective fields of study in the United States (Eduardo worked as a
blank         | 
text          | carpenter and Lorena was a stay-at-home parent who occasionally cared for additional
blank         | 
text          | children at home). Although I did not include questions about family income in the
blank         | 
text          | interviews, the data parents provided on the survey indicated their annual family incomes
blank         | 
text          | ranged between $12,000 and $25,000, with the exception of the Orozcos who indicated
blank         | 
text          | their combined income fell between $40,000 and $49,000 (with both parents working full-

blank         | 
text          | and daughters in El Salvador, a portion of the family income was sent to the home country.

text          | As an example of data shown in Table 2b, for Naomi Aguirre, more regular exposure to
blank         | 
text          | English began when she started kindergarten, and continued in first, second and finally
blank         | 
text          | third grade (which she was enrolled in during the data collection period).
blank         | 
text          |         Aside from demographic factors, in the selection process I also paid attention to
blank         | 
text          | technology access in the home; families have varying levels of access to and interest in
blank         | 
text          | media. At the start of the study, the family with fewest working devices (the Martínez
blank         | 
text          | family) had one smartphone, one basic cell phone and one television with cable, but no
blank         | 
text          | Internet access at home (other than via the smartphone) and no functioning computer. The
blank         | 
text          | family with the most technology infrastructure at home (the Aguirre family) had two
blank         | 
text          | televisions, a desktop computer, two smartphones, an iPod touch, a handheld game player,
blank         | 
text          | an iPad and a Wii game console also equipped with Netflix. These were two ends of the
blank         | 
text          | spectrum at the outset of the study and each family in the study had a unique configuration
blank         | 
text          | of devices and routines that added dimension.
blank         | 
text          |        As regards the parents’ level of spoken English, all seven fathers described
blank         | 
text          | themselves as speaking some English. Each of the fathers was employed full time, and
blank         | 
text          | attributed their English knowledge in large part to interactions at the workplace. In contrast,
blank         | 
text          | six out of seven mothers described themselves as speaking very little English. The one
blank         | 
text          | remaining mother, Rebeca Rivera, considered herself to have some proficiency in English,
blank         | 
text          | enough to communicate. The majority of the participating families had adopted a
blank         | 
text          | traditional family structure, with mothers staying at home to care for children. According
blank         | 
text          | to Pew nationwide surveys, this is frequently the case with Hispanic-Latino immigrants
blank         | 
text          | raising children – 44 per cent of Hispanic-Latino immigrant mothers of children zero to 18
blank         | 
text          | stay at home (as compared to 25 per cent of white and black mothers in the U.S.). This

blank         | 
text          | believe that having one parent stay at home is better for children, in comparison to about
blank         | 
text          | 60 per cent of both U.S.-born Hispanic-Latinos and non-Hispanic-Latino Americans (Cohn,
blank         | 
text          | Livingston & Wang, 2014). Five of the seven mothers in this sample were occupied
blank         | 
text          | principally with caring for their children and did not work outside the home.3 In addition,
blank         | 
text          | like the majority of survey respondents in the Pew study, many of the case families also
blank         | 
text          | expressed that they felt having mom stay at home was best for their children, and some
blank         | 
text          | parents expressed their view that not doing so would be a form of descuido (neglect).
blank         | 
text          |             Parents’ employment situation also had a bearing on opportunities to acquire English.
blank         | 
text          | While fathers usually described having learned to speak and understand some English in
blank         | 
text          | the day-to-day interactions at work, the stay-at-home mothers did not have this opportunity.
blank         | 
text          | One working mother, Sara Morales, was employed full-time throughout the study.
blank         | 
text          | However, as a housecleaner working alongside other Spanish speakers she experienced
blank         | 
text          | minimal or no interactions in English. Rebeca Rivera, who counted herself as more
blank         | 
text          | proficient in English than did the other mothers in the sample, is a single working mother
blank         | 
text          | and due to her jobs in the service/food industry was required to communicate in English
blank         | 
text          | more that were the other mothers in this study. Regardless of parents’ proficiency in
blank         | 
text          | English, all described their home language as exclusively Spanish, although Rebeca
blank         | 
text          | reported that her two daughters sometimes incorporated English words or phrases when
blank         | 
text          | speaking to each other. I did not distribute assessments to determine family members’

text          | University’s IRB, and all participating families consented to participate via approved

text          | consent and assent forms that detailed time commitment, procedures and how/when
blank         | 
text          | families would receive their iPads. This information included the fact that the iPads would

text          | be for families to keep, and did not place any conditions on families keeping the iPads. All
blank         | 
text          | forms were provided in Spanish and all discussion was conducted in Spanish. On my first

text          | visit to families’ homes, I discussed the study aims and procedures with families (parents

text          | and children) and welcomed questions from all family members. All families whom I

text          | visited gave consent and participated as agreed through the end of the study. There was no

text          | binding condition (written or stated) for families to remain in the study until completion.

text          |              The data collection period for this study was six months for each family. I visited

text          | families once every two weeks (approximately twice a month) for approximately 90
blank         | 
text          | minutes, at times when media activities are most likely to occur. In addition to naturalistic
blank         | 
text          | observation in homes, I conducted two focused parent interviews and several brief artifact-
blank         | 
text          | based interviews with focal children and other family members. In the latter, I asked

blank         | 
text          | scheduling and surveys were conducted in Spanish only, as per the preference families
blank         | 
text          | expressed and in accordance with families’ primary home language. In total, I visited each
blank         | 
text          | family 13 times. All visits were conducted in homes with the exception of two visits with
blank         | 
text          | Érica Martínez and her sons, which occurred in a local public library where they spent
blank         | 
text          | extended amounts of time and used computers regularly to access online content. Over the
blank         | 
text          | course of six months, I collected approximately 140 hours of interviews and observations,
blank         | 
text          | which were all audio-recorded and correspond to field notes created using a LiveScribe

title         | Arranging Visits and Establishing Rapport
blank         | 
text          |                Families in this study often had limited time available where children were at home
blank         | 
text          | with one or both parents and could receive visits. I worked with the schedule of each
blank         | 
text          | participating family and visited them at the times each family preferred. I tried to vary
blank         | 
text          | days and times that the visits occurred, however some families were only available on
blank         | 
text          | weeknights, some only on weekends, or on specific days due to parents’ work schedules
blank         | 
text          | and other activities. For example, with the Orozco family visits only occurred on
blank         | 
text          | weekends. Carmen Orozco worked days and José Rubén worked nights. Their son
blank         | 
text          | Brandon attended school and after-school programs from early morning until 6 pm, then
blank         | 
text          | accompanied his father (who slept during the day) to pick up his mother from work and
blank         | 
text          | there was not enough time to conduct weekday visits between their return home and
blank         | 
text          | Brandon’s bedtime. At the end of each visit with each family, I took the final moments to
blank         | 
text          | schedule the next visit, so that at the end of each appointment both I and the parent(s)

blank         | 
text          | parents to return phone calls or messages.
blank         | 
text          |        Although my very first contact with parents occurred face-to-face and by phone
blank         | 
text          | (for screening), subsequent communications for scheduling visits normally took place via
blank         | 
text          | text message. I communicated primarily with mothers to arrange visits. All mothers had
blank         | 
text          | smartphones (by the end of the study, all fathers did too), and all parents used text
blank         | 
text          | messaging for day-to-day communication. As mentioned, visits were scheduled two weeks
blank         | 
text          | in advance. To ensure that parents remembered scheduled visit times, I always sent a
blank         | 
text          | confirmation text message the day prior, or sometimes early on the same day for evening
blank         | 
text          | appointments. Parents also communicated with me via text message when they needed to
blank         | 
text          | reschedule an appointment. Text messaging appeared to be the strongly preferred mode of
blank         | 
text          | communication among parents.
blank         | 
text          |        Several factors assisted in establishing positive rapport with families. The fact that I
blank         | 
text          | had contacted participants via leaders of community organizations that families trusted was,
blank         | 
text          | in my view, an important building block in establishing rapport with participants. My
blank         | 
text          | position as a student at a renowned local university was advantageous for gaining
blank         | 
text          | credibility with families, and certainly helped establish trust with the community
blank         | 
text          | organizations that connected me. However, I believe that being introduced to participants
blank         | 
text          | by trusted community leaders was a critical step in inspiring confidence – families’
blank         | 
text          | confidence that I was a trustworthy person conducting a worthwhile research project.
blank         | 
text          |        Second, some aspects of my personal background and expertise helped me to
blank         | 
text          | connect with parents. As a mother of a two-year-old son myself, I was able to find
blank         | 
text          | common ground with other parents based on our respective experiences raising youngsters.

text          | I often chatted with parents about the stages our children were going through, the
blank         | 
text          | challenges of parenting and so on. Families often asked about my son, and I happily shared
blank         | 
text          | news, anecdotes or occasional photos with them. The fact that I had been a teacher in the
blank         | 
text          | past and was pursuing studies in education meant that we shared another topic of interest.
blank         | 
text          | Several parents specifically expressed the desire to learn about the area that I was studying
blank         | 
text          | and how to use media to support their children’s learning, and all were deeply interested in
blank         | 
text          | supporting their children’s education overall. Some parents referred to me as la maestra
blank         | 
text          | during visits. For example, I overheard from a parent on the phone: Te llamo después. La
blank         | 
text          | maestra está aqui con las niñas. (I’ll call you later. The teacher is here with the children.)
blank         | 
text          | These instances came up most often when parents were referring to me or the visits in
blank         | 
text          | conversations with others, so it was not entirely clear whether all parents actually thought
blank         | 
text          | of me as a teacher, or simply used that as a way to describe or justify my presence to
blank         | 
text          | friends or family.
blank         | 
text          |        Finally, I do not underestimate the power of the relatively valuable material
blank         | 
text          | incentive (a new iPad 2) that I was offering, and how that motivated families to participate.
blank         | 
text          | Certainly, I would have found the recruitment process much more difficult had I not
blank         | 
text          | offered the iPads. However, although I was offering this incentive, I was also proposing to
blank         | 
text          | spend a considerable amount of time in participants’ homes, with them and their children.
blank         | 
text          | The promise of the iPad was certainly powerful in motivating parents to participate, but I
blank         | 
text          | believe the other factors above were also essential in helping families feel comfortable
blank         | 
text          | with me, regularly welcoming my presence in their homes and allowing me to spend time
blank         | 
text          | with them and their children in their own private spheres.

text          |        It is also important to note the many differences between my personal background
blank         | 
text          | and those of participants. I could by no means consider myself an “insider” among these
blank         | 
text          | families. I am not Hispanic-Latina myself; I am of European-Jewish heritage and come
blank         | 
text          | from a middle-class background. Although I am multi-lingual, am a former Spanish
blank         | 
text          | teacher and consider that I speak Spanish fluently, I am not a native speaker. There were
blank         | 
text          | certainly linguistic subtleties that might have been picked up on by a native speaker of
blank         | 
text          | Mexican or Salvadoran Spanish but were lost on my foreign ear. However, I felt I was
blank         | 
text          | able to express myself well and comprehend easily what families were telling me, and I
blank         | 
text          | found them to be very patient in explaining to me anything that I hadn’t understood at first.
blank         | 
text          | All of the interviews, as well as several observations that were rich in dialogue about
blank         | 
text          | relevant themes for the study, were transcribed in Mexico by native speakers of Mexican
blank         | 
text          | Spanish. Engaging native speakers to transcribe the audio helped me to understand
blank         | 
text          | additional nuances that may not have been apparent in the moment, as I was able to read
blank         | 
text          | and reflect upon what was said.

blank         |

text          | media use/co-engagement and use of media for language learning.
blank         | 
text          |        On observation visits, I observed regular home activities with media. I also used a
blank         | 
text          | variation of “artifact-based” interview methodology (e.g. Barron et al. 2014; Barron,
blank         | 
text          | Martin, Roberts, Osipovich & Ross, 2002; Harper, 2002), asking family members to
blank         | 
text          | explain media practices family members were engaging in or had engaged in. I also asked
blank         | 
text          | questions regarding changes I observed and the events of the past two weeks since the
blank         | 
text          | prior visit in order to document shifts in family routine, circumstances, practices and
blank         | 
text          | interests that might relate to their media use and/or broader family ecology.

title         | ABI Interviews
blank         | 
text          |        I conducted artifact-based interviews (ABIs) with children and adults about their
blank         | 
text          | media use, particularly regarding their use of the applications on the iPads they received. I
blank         | 
text          | also interviewed participants about their media use and media preferences before the iPad
blank         | 
text          | was introduced. ABI questions were distributed across several observation sessions, in
blank         | 
text          | order to document the various media activities children engaged in, making use of the
blank         | 
text          | multiple opportunities I had to engage children in conversation. The second-to-last visit
blank         | 
text          | with each family (prior to the final visit which was dedicated to interviewing parents) was
blank         | 
text          | structured as a full-session artifact-based interview in which children demonstrated their
blank         | 
text          | practices with iPad activities of their choice, and was video-recorded. Due to the young
blank         | 
text          | age of many children in the study, I used a simple interview protocol that included basic
blank         | 
text          | prompts such as “tell me about this [game/show/tool],” “show me how you use this,” and
blank         |

              |

blank         | 	  
              | 	  
text          | “what do you do next?.” Most additional prompts were based on the nature of the program
blank         | 
text          | as it progressed and varied depending on the content at hand. For example, when Amanda
blank         | 
text          | Acosta showed me a television show she enjoyed, probes included, “who are they
blank         | 
text          | [characters]?,” and questions about the story, whereas when David Martínez showed me a
blank         | 
text          | video game he played, probes included “What do you have to do here?” and “How do you
blank         | 
text          | get better at this game?.” In each case I asked about basic features, how long the family
blank         | 
text          | member had used the program, and so on. Sometimes it was a challenge to obtain
blank         | 
text          | information from younger children such as how long they had been using a program and
blank         | 
text          | had to adjust prompts or try to inquire with parents. Sometimes it was also challenging to
blank         | 
text          | obtain answers from younger children while they were watching shows or videos and in
blank         | 
text          | these cases I tried again when they ended.
blank         | 
text          |        During observations, I often initiated what I refer to as “mini ABI interviews”
blank         | 
text          | where I probed participants about activities they mentioned to me. By asking questions
blank         | 
text          | about what participants were doing, as well as asking them to show me media practices
blank         | 
text          | that they weren’t currently engaged in, I could collect information about activities that did
blank         | 
text          | not occur during my visits, and also gain insight into participants’ thoughts, beliefs and
blank         | 
text          | approaches regarding media and technology. These mini ABI interviews focused on media
blank         | 
text          | activities that the child or adult had engaged in or spoken about in the session. For
blank         | 
text          | example, after Natalia Acosta explained that she used Google Translate to complete her
blank         | 
text          | homework for English class, I asked her to show me her process of doing so.

blank         | 
text          |        The majority of the home visits I conducted did not include formal interviews. In
blank         | 
text          | these visits, I spent at least half of the visit simply observing how parents and children
blank         | 
text          | were interacting with media. However, I also incorporated “mini artifact-based interviews”
blank         | 
text          | (ABIs – see above) into observation visits.

text          | Tablet Intervention: Preparing iPads to Record Data
blank         | 
text          |        In the tablet intervention, I provided each family with one iPad tablet device
blank         | 
text          | roughly halfway through the data collection period. As I was successful in visiting each
blank         | 
text          | family approximately every two weeks, this coincided with the seventh visit and marked
blank         | 
text          | the completion of three months of participation in the study. In order to track families’ use
blank         | 
text          | of the iPads, I used an app called “AppStat” which is available for jailbroken iPads.
blank         | 
text          | Jailbreaking, though the term suggests some sort of illegal security breach, simply refers to
blank         | 
text          | (legally) removing limitations on the iOS software on a particular device. I had each iPad
blank         | 
text          | jailbroken prior to presenting them to families. This modification of the iPads allowed
blank         | 
text          | them to be equipped with AppStat, an application that tracks the use of other applications
blank         | 
text          | on the device, and which was the most useful of the data tracking apps I found in my
blank         | 
text          | research. I installed AppStat along with the other apps I had chosen for families (see the
blank         | 
text          | following section on the app selection process and Table 2d, below).
blank         | 
text          |        After distributing the iPads, subsequent visits included questions about the families’
blank         | 
text          | use of the iPads, and the data recorded in AppStat served as a prompt for questions. For
blank         | 
text          | example, if AppStat indicated that a certain app had been opened 20 times and used for a

blank         | 
text          | what ways they used it, and often would request that the family members in question show
blank         | 
text          | me how they tended to use the app, if I had not already observed them using it in that day’s
blank         |

title         | Tablet Intervention: Selecting iPad Content
blank         | 
text          |         Choosing content for the families’ iPads presented some daunting challenges.
blank         | 
text          | There are hundreds of thousands of apps available for the iPad, and a large percentage of
blank         | 
text          | these purport to be in some way “educational” (with or without empirical basis, usually
blank         | 
text          | without). Due to the fact that I was choosing content for both children and adults – and
blank         | 
text          | hopefully apps that would invite joint engagement – I had a very wide array to choose
blank         | 
text          | from.
blank         | 
text          |         I could not feasibly review every app related to language or literacy, due to time
blank         | 
text          | constraints but also because of the financial cost since many apps are not free or require a
blank         | 
text          | purchase to unlock the most valuable features. I did not want to limit the selection to free
blank         | 
text          | apps, since much of the higher quality content available on iTunes does come with a price
blank         | 
text          | tag and I wanted to provide families with the best quality content possible. For this reason,
blank         | 
text          | I did apply for and was fortunate to receive funding via the Amir Lopatin Award to
blank         | 
text          | provide for-purchase apps, along with the iPads themselves.
blank         | 
text          |         The difficult task still remained: to determine which of the thousands of available
blank         | 
text          | apps would be included with the families’ iPads. I began by employing a three-phase
blank         |

blank         | 	  
              | 	  
text          | selection process to narrow down the possibilities. I also created a structure in which I
blank         | 
text          | identified:
blank         | 
text          | 1. A core group of apps that were provided to all families, as well as
blank         | 
text          | 2. A group of “elective” apps that I chose based on the age and interests of family
blank         | 
text          |        members.
blank         | 
text          | I hoped that selected content would engage family members, and thus I felt that the
blank         | 
text          | “elective” app selection was important in order to personalize according to preferences of
blank         | 
text          | each family. For example, in Natalia Acosta’s family, the children were two girls aged
blank         | 
text          | two-and-a-half and five years old at the start of data collection, with the eldest enrolled in
blank         | 
text          | kindergarten. In Érica Martínez’ family, the children were two boys aged six and eight
blank         | 
text          | years old at the start of data collection, with the younger enrolled in first grade and the
blank         | 
text          | elder son enrolled in third grade. These children demonstrated, and parents reported,
blank         | 
text          | different interests in terms of media preferences and non-media activities. In addition, the
blank         | 
text          | grade levels and literacy abilities varied, and thus I endeavored to provide some content
blank         | 
text          | that I felt could engage all groups, as well as a selection of targeted content.
blank         | 
text          |           In phase one of the app selection process, I conducted a review using blogs, web
blank         | 
text          | sites and personal recommendations from parents and educators in my community in order
blank         | 
text          | to identify possible candidate apps. I also included ideas from my interviews and
blank         | 
text          | observations thus for. For example, mother Érica Martínez mentioned that she used the
blank         | 
text          | Wlingua app with her younger son David, to do vocabulary games in English. After
blank         | 
text          | sampling the Wlingua content, I decided to include Wlingua in the first selection of apps
blank         | 
text          | for all the families.

              | 	  
text          |           For app selection, I used the media literacy web site Common Sense Media. CSM
blank         | 
text          | is a non-profit organization led by educators including Dr. Sita Pai, who I had become
blank         | 
text          | acquainted with during Joint Media Engagement research workshops at Stanford. The site
blank         | 
text          | is directed toward parents searching for media for their children, and includes information
blank         | 
text          | about BOTH the entertainment and learning aspects of apps (as well as other forms of
blank         | 
text          | media), and thus was a valuable resource in terms of locating potential apps. I also did
blank         | 
text          | targeted searches online and on the iTunes store for content (for example: best apps for
blank         | 
text          | learning English, best dictionary apps, comic book related apps, apps for family group play
blank         | 
text          | and so on) which provided reviews and comparisons that guided me to apps. However I
blank         | 
text          | only used web sites and blogs to select potential apps to review, not to make my final
blank         | 
text          | selection. In all cases I personally tried the apps myself in order to narrow down the
blank         | 
text          | choices before making the final selection.
blank         | 
text          |        For the second round of selection, I personally downloaded and reviewed apps in the
blank         |

text          |        not explicitly designed for language or literacy learning (e.g. Barefoot Atlas, Comic

              | 
text          | In order to make the final selection, as I reviewed apps I evaluated them based on the
blank         | 
text          | following criteria:
blank         | 
text          | 1. Is the interface of the app engaging and reasonably intuitive to use?
blank         | 
text          | 2. Is the content of the app appropriate for the children’s age and developmental niche?
blank         | 
text          | 3. Does the app offer either an explicitly designed experience with language and/or
blank         | 
text          |        literacy learning? If not, does it provide opportunities to practice reading,
blank         | 
text          |        comprehension or speaking?
blank         | 
text          | 4. In the case of creative apps, does the app provide opportunities to create stories or
blank         | 
text          |        personal narratives?
blank         | 
text          | 5. For the adult language learning apps: does the app provide content that could be useful
blank         | 
text          |        to parents in their everyday lives?

blank         | 
text          |          experience than any free app available?4
blank         | 
text          |          From the apps that I rated highest for the above criteria, I created a core group of apps
blank         | 
text          | for all families. These apps, a brief description of each and small illustrations are provided
blank         | 
text          | in Table 2d. Whereas I did not generally include apps for playing television shows (other
blank         | 
text          | than YouTube, which families all used previously), I did include the PBSKids app which
blank         | 
text          | offers access to programs from PBSKids including Sesame Street, Electric Company,
blank         | 
text          | SuperWhy, Arthur and other programs I felt could be engaging and useful to participants.

text          | and that children were developing at school in the Spanish immersion programs they all

text          | Spanish and English, or that offered support for English learners by providing translation

text          | or other cues. There were few high quality Spanish literacy materials available as
blank         | 
text          | compared to English literacy resources. Several of the apps targeted at preschoolers, such

blank         |

title         | Tablet Intervention: Introducing Tablets to Families
blank         | 
text          |        When I distributed iPads to the families I asked that all family members be present
blank         | 
text          | to receive a quick demonstration of the device, where they were able to try out its many
blank         | 
text          | functions and ask questions. In the demonstrations, I showed families the applications
blank         | 
text          | installed on the tablet, as well as some of the “native” apps that are factory installed such
blank         | 
text          | as the camera and Safari web browser, so that they could be aware of the content that is
blank         | 
text          | there and what each app might be used for. I also created and gave each family a list with
blank         | 
text          | each app provided including a sentence or two that summarized what the app does (see
blank         | 
text          | Appendix B). Nearly all of the apps I loaded onto the iPads are related in some way to
blank         | 
text          | language and literacy, and provide opportunities to develop language through interacting
blank         | 
text          | with visual and audio content. Apps such as YouTube and Skype were also installed on
blank         | 
text          | the devices.

text          |          Along with the iPad, I gave each family an “iBlason” protective case, which
blank         | 
text          | features a handle, insulates the device from impact (if dropped, hit, etc., which I
blank         | 
text          | anticipated as a high risk particularly in the families with toddlers). The case also allows
blank         | 
text          | the iPad to be propped up on a table or other surface such that the screen is perpendicular
blank         | 
text          | to the surface and one does not have to hold it up to look straight at the screen. I was
blank         | 
text          | sensitive to the fact that Apple does not insure devices for accidental damage and hoped
blank         | 
text          | the case would prevent tablet damage – damage that families might not be able to afford to
blank         | 
text          | repair. Whether due to the iBlason cases or to families’ careful handling of the device
blank         | 
text          | (most likely both), no family reported any sort of iPad damage during the six months of
blank         | 
text          | data collection and all iPads appeared to be functioning in like-new condition at the study’s
blank         | 
text          | close.
blank         | 
text          |          I anticipated that participants’ use of apps would be shaped to some extent by their
blank         | 
text          | home Internet access, for the basic reason that some apps require an Internet connection to
blank         | 
text          | access data. I spoke with each family accordingly to help them learn how best to use the
blank         | 
text          | iPads given their access and needs. In this study, two of the participant families did not

text          | computer to the Internet. Once they had saved the hotspot ID and password in the iPad
blank         | 
text          | and set it to connect automatically, they were able to connect their iPad to the Internet by
blank         | 
text          | simply turning on the smartphone’s hotspot function. In this way, the Acosta family was
blank         | 
text          | able to use apps with online functions, but their connection speed using the cellular
blank         | 
text          | network was slower than broadband and had to be set up intentionally. The remaining

blank         | 
text          | hotspot creation. For this reason they were not able to connect the iPad to the Internet at
blank         | 
text          | home except occasionally during my visits, when I used my own phone to provide access
blank         | 
text          | for them, for example to download new Reading Rainbow books. They were interested in
blank         | 
text          | installing Internet access via a low cost Connect-2-Compete plan, which they qualified for,
blank         | 
text          | or by sharing a plan with their neighbors, but by the end of home visits they had not
blank         | 
text          | succeeded in getting Internet access installed via either route. On some occasions, they
blank         | 
text          | visited family members who had wi-fi and connected the iPad there.
blank         | 
text          |        As part of the iPad introduction I gave information to families on how to access the
blank         | 
text          | iTunes store and download new content. Prior to distributing the iPads, I equipped each
blank         | 
text          | one with an Apple ID (using a new Gmail account I created for them) and a password
blank         | 
text          | based on easy-to-remember family names and street addresses. I printed out the account
blank         | 
text          | information as well as other reminders on a handout (personalized with the login
blank         | 
text          | information for each family) that I presented to families to keep as well as the sheet with a
blank         | 
text          | brief description of each app I had installed (Appendix B). The session itself was not
blank         | 
text          | intended as a comprehensive tutorial but simply as a way of presenting the iPad’s basic
blank         | 
text          | functions and explaining how to use the apps installed. From that point, families were free
blank         | 
text          | to explore the programs installed, add any additional apps and/or delete apps. I did not
blank         | 
text          | provide iTunes store credit for families to use to purchase apps. However, in one instance,
blank         | 
text          | I had inadvertently left a balance on a family’s iTunes account and the children used it to
blank         | 
text          | purchase apps and in-app features, unbeknownst to their parents. I replaced those funds on
blank         | 
text          | the family’s account and purchased their Reading Rainbow account on the following visit.
blank         | 
text          | Over the remaining three months of the study, I answered questions and offered support to

text          | families as requested, and occasionally made suggestions or helped families download new
blank         | 
text          | apps if they expressed an interest. For example, in the fifth month of the study Brandon
blank         | 
text          | Orozco was having difficulties with math in school and his teacher had alerted his parents,
blank         | 
text          | who were very concerned. They inquired about math practice on the iPad and I helped
blank         | 
text          | them locate and install three math practice apps.
blank         | 
text          |        As part of the tablet introduction I showed each family the “AppStat” app that I
blank         | 
text          | would be using to track their use of apps. I explained to families that this app was for
blank         | 
text          | recording the amount of time and number of times apps were used, and that it would not
blank         | 
text          | record the content of their activities, for example what websites they used, or the content of
blank         | 
text          | their email messages. I wanted to make sure families knew I would not be “spying” on
blank         | 
text          | their communications or searches, so that they would feel free to use the iPad as they
blank         | 
text          | wished. I also asked families not to remove the AppStat app or data until after the study
blank         | 
text          | was over.
blank         | 
text          |        Overall, introducing the iPads was a smooth process, and both children and parents
blank         | 
text          | appeared very pleased with their new device. Children expressed delight when I presented
blank         | 
text          | the iPad in its box and invited children to open it. The main challenges encountered during
blank         | 
text          | the iPad introductions were first and foremost, the number of apps and functions to go
blank         | 
text          | through and the difficulty of retaining all of this information. For this reason I created the
blank         | 
text          | list of apps with descriptions, so that families would have a reference if they needed it. In
blank         | 
text          | addition, I wanted to give families a chance to actually try interacting with the apps during
blank         | 
text          | the presentation, so they could learn by doing rather than simply watching. The challenge
blank         | 
text          | with this approach was that once children started using an app they wanted to continue
blank         | 
text          | playing with it. However in these situations I or the parent(s) would gently ask them to
blank         |

              | 
              |

              | 	  
text          | pass the iPad back so that we could look at the next app, and reassured them that after we
blank         | 
text          | finished going through everything they would have a chance to play more.
blank         | 
text          |        At the close of data collection, I offered families the option to update their iPads to
blank         | 
text          | the latest system of iOS (removing the “jailbroken” software and the AppStat tracker along
blank         | 
text          | with it). Six of the seven families accepted this offer and I updated their iPads accordingly,
blank         | 
text          | maintaining all of the apps and data that were there. Érica Martínez opted to continue
blank         | 
text          | using their iPad with the system it had, and reported that she found AppStat useful for
blank         | 
text          | keeping track of what programs her sons were using.

blank         | 
text          |        In addition to the artifact-based interviews mentioned earlier in this chapter, I
blank         | 
text          | tracked iPad usage with “AppStat,” an app for jailbroken iPads that keeps a running log of
blank         | 
text          | all apps used including how many times the app was opened, total time used and the last
blank         | 
text          | date of use. This information was useful for prompting families to explain who used the
blank         | 
text          | various apps, how, when and with whom. I was also able to monitor how much the iPad
blank         | 
text          | was used overall on a biweekly basis and keep a record of new apps families downloaded
blank         | 
text          | and used. I literally took snapshots of the AppStat data at each visit and then reset the data
blank         | 
text          | so that it would begin recording afresh. From the photos of the AppStat screen, I entered
blank         | 
text          | the data into an Excel spreadsheet that I could then analyze and manipulate to understand
blank         | 
text          | app usage over time.

title         | Survey Distribution
blank         | 
text          |        The survey component of this study consisted of distributing the Families and
blank         | 
text          | Media Survey (Rideout, 2014) – developed and distributed in 2013 by the Joan Ganz
blank         | 
text          | Cooney Center – to a parent from each participating family. Case participants’ survey
blank         | 
text          | responses are integrated with qualitative data in each chapter. I was aware of the survey’s
blank         | 
text          | ongoing development in the spring of 2013, as I had been collaborating with the JGC for
blank         | 
text          | some time as part of Dr. Brigid Barron’s YouthLAB at Stanford University. Several items
blank         | 
text          | on the survey were derived from prior YouthLAB research, and Professor Barron and I
blank         | 
text          | ourselves provided feedback on the development of the Families and Media survey and
blank         | 
text          | contributed items that were based on some of our prior research with families (Barron et al.,
blank         | 
text          | in preparation). During the summer when I began data collection with participants, the
blank         | 
text          | JGCC distributed the survey to a nationally representative sample of 1577 parents across
blank         | 
text          | the US, including an oversample of 682 Hispanic-Latino families, via third-party agency
blank         | 
text          | GFK. The survey asks parents about their primary home language, and within the 682
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino parents surveyed, a sub-sample of 303 parents indicated their primary
blank         | 
text          | home language was “mainly” or “only” a non-English language. The survey includes over
blank         | 
text          | forty items related to family media use, as well as solo use by parents and children.
blank         | 
text          | Participants nationwide could complete the survey in either English or Spanish. The
blank         | 
text          | survey items themselves can be found in Rideout’s (2014) report, in English (note that
blank         | 
text          | participants received the Spanish version provided by the Cooney Center). Survey
blank         | 
text          | responses are shared in an integrated manner with the qualitative data and include
blank         | 
text          | frequency of parent Internet use for learning, parents’ perceptions of children’s learning
blank         | 
text          | from educational media on different platforms, frequency of learning-related activities

blank         | 
text          |                  The timely nature of the Families and Media survey development and distribution
blank         | 
text          | offered an excellent opportunity to include quantitative data in this research. Although my
blank         | 
text          | own study sample includes only seven families, in instances throughout this dissertation I
blank         | 
text          | am able to show how case parents’ responses echoed or differed from other parents’
blank         | 
text          | responses around the country, including a large sample of Hispanic-Latino parents (n=303)
blank         | 
text          | whose primary home language is not English. As the Families and Media survey was
blank         | 
text          | distributed in both English and Spanish, I was able to provide my participants with the
blank         | 
text          | same Spanish version that was distributed to Spanish-speaking parents around the country.
blank         | 
text          |                  Although the survey my participants received was the same in content as the survey
blank         | 
text          | distributed to the nationwide sample, it is worth noting that there was a difference in the
blank         | 
text          | manner the survey was administered. First of all, participants in this study did not have full
blank         | 
text          | anonymity – they knew me, and knew that I would know who their survey responses
blank         | 
text          | belonged to. In addition to this difference, they received the survey in a different format. I
blank         | 
text          | was not able to use the same system that the nationwide sample experienced, as the survey
blank         | 
text          | agency used (GFK) could not or would not provide an interactive version, they only
blank         | 
text          | provided a paper version.6
blank         | 
text          |                  Due to these logistical constraints, I administered the survey to participants orally,
blank         | 
text          | sitting next to parents as we filled in responses together. I chose this method because the

blank         | 
text          | logic, and would not have worked reliably if given to participants unaided. The survey was
blank         | 
text          | designed to be taken on a computer, not on paper, and has many items that funnel
blank         | 
text          | responses from one question into a subsequent item. For example, if a parent indicated
blank         | 
text          | that he or she spent 20 minutes watching television with his or her child yesterday, a
blank         | 
text          | following item used the response “20 minutes” in a following item regarding how much of
blank         | 
text          | that time the parent had been watching with the child. There were also many items that
blank         | 
text          | were designed to appear (or not appear) depending on the participant’s prior response(s).
blank         | 
text          | Rather than risk errors or misunderstandings due to the survey format, or alter the survey
blank         | 
text          | greatly from its original form, I opted to use a portion of one of the home visits with each
blank         | 
text          | family to sit down with a parent and go through the survey in person. By giving the survey
blank         | 
text          | orally, I was able to complete the calculations and insertions for participants in the moment,
blank         | 
text          | thus recreating the items that were provided on the original survey. I was also able to skip
blank         | 
text          | over items that did not apply and make sure that participants did fill out the items that
blank         | 
text          | applied to them.
blank         | 
text          |        I believe this method yielded much more accurate results than I would have
blank         | 
text          | gathered by distributing the survey without “proctoring” it. However, one potential
blank         | 
text          | disadvantage of this methodology in terms of comparing results between samples is that
blank         | 
text          | responses from participants in this study may differ in some ways because of the way the
blank         | 
text          | survey was administered. Although one cannot pinpoint differences, I would expect that
blank         | 
text          | participants in my sample had a greater understanding of some of the items than did the
blank         | 
text          | participants who did not have a “proctor” to support them as they responded. Although
blank         | 
text          | participants I administered the survey to understood most items, some were fairly complex

blank         | 	  
              | 	  
text          | in syntax and I would expect that the opportunity to have these read orally as well as in
blank         | 
text          | print would have clarified some items, particularly with respondents whose literacy skills
blank         | 
text          | may be less advanced. In some cases participants explicitly expressed that they did not
blank         | 
text          | understand an item and requested elaboration. In those cases I was able to make sure that
blank         | 
text          | they did understand it before filling in a response. Finally, I participated in and supervised
blank         | 
text          | the physical filling out of the survey, so I expect that there were fewer careless errors
blank         | 
text          | among this small sample’s responses than among those from the nationwide sample. My
blank         | 
text          | presence may also have affected survey responses in other ways I cannot determine. Unlike

text          | the nationwide sample, in this study participants did not have anonymity (from the
blank         | 
text          | researcher) when filling out the survey, however this would have been the case regardless
blank         | 
text          | of whether they had taken it online, alone on paper or with me.
blank         | 
text          |        Administering the survey orally also provided an unanticipated trove of qualitative
blank         | 
text          | data. Parents often reflected and elaborated on their responses as we went through the
blank         | 
text          | items together. For example, on items that asked how much the child had learned about
blank         | 
text          | different content areas (such as math) from using mobile devices, as parents were choosing
blank         | 
text          | their response they would sometimes also describe orally the related programs that
blank         | 
text          | children had used. From these “think-alouds,” I was able to probe into several aspects of
blank         | 
text          | family media use that had not come up in parent interviews. I audio-recorded each survey
blank         | 
text          | session, and the comments recorded became, in effect, an additional interview that adds to
blank         | 
text          | qualitative data. In this way, the survey provides quantitative data but also served as a
blank         | 
text          | prompt that elicited additional qualitative data.

title         | Interviews & Observations

text          |          I coded data from interviews and digitized field notes using a grounded theory
blank         | 
text          | (Charmaz, 1995; 2006) approach to document emergent themes, using the primary
blank         | 
text          | research questions of the study as guiding frameworks. These guiding questions are:
blank         | 
text          | 1. What language and literacy experiences does media provide or facilitate for children
blank         | 
text          |        who are developing as dual language learners and for parents who are also learning
blank         | 
text          |        English?
blank         | 
text          | 2. What language- and literacy-related media practices and activities do families engage in,
blank         | 
text          |        either solo or together, as part of their daily routines?
blank         | 
text          | 3. What family dynamics and practices develop around a newly introduced tablet device
blank         | 
text          |        loaded with a small set of high quality literacy and language resources?
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
text          | Given this relatively new and unexplored topic of research, the grounded theory approach
blank         | 
text          | allowed for the process to capture any salient themes or patterns present in the data rather
blank         | 
text          | than approaching it with a previously determined set of codes.
blank         | 
text          |          To answer the first research question, I began by creating an inventory of media
blank         | 
text          | devices and programs that each family uses, and the different environments and partners
blank         | 
text          | for each media activity of the focal children and other individual family members. This
blank         | 
text          | part of the analysis includes a description of daily family routines (e.g. Goldenberg,
blank         | 
text          | Gallimore and Reese, 2005) that occur with each medium in each environment. Questions
blank         | 
text          | from the initial round of interviews provided me with this entry point data. I had also
blank         | 
text          | photographed each family’s devices over the course of the data collection period, and these

blank         | 
text          |        The coding of observations (field notes) and interviews contributed to answering all
blank         | 
text          | three research questions. To answer questions one and two relevant data were drawn from
blank         | 
text          | the first three months of the study (pre-iPad intervention) and also included the
blank         | 
text          | continuation of activities and practices documented in the first half of the study that
blank         | 
text          | continued during the second half, or activities and practices that did not relate to the iPads
blank         | 
text          | in any apparent way. Data that addressed research question three were drawn from the
blank         | 
text          | second half of the study (when families had their iPads), including the child ABI
blank         | 
text          | interviews in which children demonstrated activities they enjoyed on their tablets. For
blank         | 
text          | research question 3, the quantitative data generated by the AppStat program installed on
blank         | 
text          | families’ iPads provided a measure of how much time families were spending with each
blank         | 
text          | app on the device (details below).
blank         | 
text          |        Once data were collected and transcriptions complete, I used Dedoose qualitative
blank         | 
text          | analysis software to organize and code the interview transcripts, field notes and visit
blank         | 
text          | summaries (written immediately after each visit). Most observations were coded using
blank         | 
text          | field notes only, however wherever I had transcribed part of an observation visit, I coded
blank         | 
text          | that transcript as well. Most observations were not transcribed. However, the fact that
blank         | 
text          | family visits were recorded using a Livescribe pen meant that all field notes were linked to
blank         | 
text          | the audio that was being recorded while they were written. Thus, where interactions were
blank         | 
text          | particularly relevant to the research questions but may not have been adequately captured
blank         | 
text          | in field notes, I transcribed (myself or via the transcribers) brief or extended sections of
blank         | 
text          | observations. In this way, transcription of observation excerpts supplemented what I was
blank         | 
text          | able to document in the moment. Data sources also included video-based notes that I

blank         | 
text          |             Using a grounded theory approach (Charmaz, 1995; 2006), I began with line-by-line
blank         | 
text          | “open coding” to capture any and all emergent themes. After the first round of coding, I
blank         | 
text          | refined the coding scheme to organize and reflect the themes that emerged from the data.
blank         | 
text          | From this coding process, several codes related to language or literacy learning. These
blank         | 
text          | marked concrete activities that might be associated with learning aspects of language or
blank         | 
text          | literacy, as well as beliefs related to learning, strategies parents used to locate content, the
blank         | 
text          | role of extended family in brokering access to language and media content, and so on), and
blank         | 
text          | these were the primary codes used for selecting and grouping examples shared in Chapters
blank         | 
text          | Four, Five and Six, depending on the relevant research question(s). Table 2e for a
blank         | 
text          | selection of the final codes used). This combination of codes identified 1179 coded
blank         | 
text          | excerpts from interviews and observations. Using these themes and patterns that emerged
blank         | 
text          | in analysis, I constructed theoretical memos to draw together examples from interviews
blank         | 
text          | and observations that corresponded to codes and groups of related codes.

text          |             In some instances, coded segments of field notes, the coding process directed me
blank         | 
text          | back to the raw data in order to derive more detail for the purposes of sharing in the
blank         | 
text          | relevant chapter(s). One particular advantage of using field notes created with the
blank         | 
text          | Livescribe pen, is that I was able to easily locate and return to the audio recorded at the
blank         | 
text          | time that a particular note was created, and if needed transcribe that audio to provide more
blank         | 
text          | detail for the chapter. For example, one field note captured Naomi Aguirre’s use of the
blank         | 
text          | “My Froggy Stuff” YouTube channel to learn about building do-it-yourself doll settings
blank         | 
text          | and accessories. In the LiveScribe software, the section of the field note where I noted this
blank         | 
text          | is directly linked to the audio that was being recorded at the time when I wrote it. In this
blank         | 
text          | way, I was able to return to the corresponding audio and transcribe verbatim the way that
blank         | 
text          | Naomi described her use of the channel and share it in her own words. This procedure
blank         | 
text          | allowed me to “reconstruct” particular examples after they were located and grouped via
blank         | 
text          | the coding scheme.

text          |        Finally, the quantitative data collected using AppStat on each family’s iPad
blank         | 
text          | (documenting the amount of time that families used each app on their tablet) provided an
blank         | 
text          | additional layer of analysis that revealed a portrait of tablet use for each family. AppStat
blank         | 
text          | data was collected by looking at the report generated on the iPad and photographing the
blank         | 
text          | screen at each bi-weekly visit (the app was reset after each visit, so that each data point
blank         | 
text          | represents approximately two weeks of use). I then entered the numerical data from the
blank         | 
text          | screen photographs into spreadsheets that allowed for analyzing various use patterns. In
blank         | 
text          | Chapter Seven, dedicated to discussing the role of the iPad this usage data is shared in full.
blank         | 
text          | In addition, I draw upon families’ tablet use data to further explore or support particular
blank         | 
text          | examples in Chapters Four and Five.
blank         | 
text          |        In analyzing the data collected from the seven families, I sought comparisons
blank         | 
text          | between households in order to pinpoint sources of variability in how they use media, the
blank         | 
text          | role of different family members in any joint media activities, and the role that media plays
blank         | 
text          | in each setting. Comparisons also included the ways that children and other family
blank         | 
text          | members draw upon skills in their primary home language and/or English, and for family
blank         | 
text          | members with lower ability levels in English, the strategies they use to access meaning
blank         | 
text          | from media resources in that language.
blank         | 
text          |         With respect to the iPads distributed to families, I analyze data to identify 1. ways
blank         | 
text          | that the iPads add or expand ways of accessing English language that did not exist in the
blank         | 
text          | household before (or diminish access, if such is the case); 2. which family members make
blank         | 
text          | most use of the device, and how access is negotiated among family members; 3. any rules
blank         | 
text          | and restrictions that may be established by parents to control children’s use of the iPad, if

title         | Survey Data Analysis
blank         | 
text          |        Each family in the study completed the Families and Media survey and responses
blank         | 
text          | were entered into SPSS data analysis software, where I was able to compare results with
blank         | 
text          | the nationwide data set provided by the Joan Ganz Cooney Center. In addition to the data
blank         | 
text          | integrated within chapters, Appendix C offers a comparison of how case families
blank         | 
text          | compared to families in the nationally representative sample, focusing on the group of
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino families whose primary home language was not English). Due to the very
blank         | 
text          | small sample size in this ethnographic study (n=7), I was not able to apply causal models
blank         | 
text          | or find statistical significance. Instead, the quantitative analyses shared at various points

title         | Thematic Organization of Chapters
blank         | 
text          |            Media use is involved in several different ways in families’ routines,
blank         | 
text          | particularly with the multiple devices and platforms families use today. In order to
blank         | 
text          | organize the data in a clear and meaningful way, I sorted the coded data in two ways. First,
blank         | 
text          | logically, I separated coded data into two groups in order to pinpoint data for RQ3
blank         | 
text          | focusing on the iPad intervention. The “pre-iPad” category included data from the first
blank         | 
text          | three months of collection (prior to families receiving their iPads), as well as data that
blank         | 
text          | referred to the continuation of practices that families engaged in prior to the iPad
blank         | 
text          | intervention. The “iPad intervention” category included data that addressed the distributed
blank         | 
text          | iPads. Data from the “iPad intervention” category appears in Chapter Seven. After
blank         | 
text          | creating these two categories, I divided the “pre-iPad” data into two more categories used
blank         | 
text          | broad “roles of media codes” from the coding scheme and grouped codes together (media
blank         | 
text          | for information, for academic support, entertainment, etc.). By focusing on two general
blank         | 
text          | categories regarding the role of media – media for information, instruction and academic
blank         | 
text          | support, and media for play and entertainment – I split the coded pre-iPad intervention data
blank         | 
text          | into two broad thematic groups that served to organize and present the data. Chapter Four
blank         | 
text          | (Media for accessing meaning, information and academic support) focuses on different
blank         | 
text          | types of knowledge seeking using Internet technologies, whereas Chapter Five
blank         | 
text          | (Affordances of media for learning in the leisure space) focuses on the learning that goes
blank         | 
text          | on during playful, leisure time media activities. Of course, the “intention” for using media
blank         | 
text          | can be debated and this is by no means a perfect method of grouping the findings, however
blank         | 
text          | more specific themes and contrasts are described within each chapter to address the
blank         | 
text          | nuances inside these broad categories.

text          |            While all case families selected did meet certain criteria for selection, the
blank         | 
text          | families portrayed in this study also represent great diversity. Each adult or child had
blank         | 
text          | different individual personality and interests. There were four different countries of origin,
blank         | 
text          | and parents came from different backgrounds in terms of rural or urban upbringings, and
blank         | 
text          | varied experiences with formal schooling. The portraits shared below give an overall

text          | and the basic media routines in each household.
blank         | 
text          |            While the families and individuals were diverse, there were also basic values
blank         |

text          | bonds when they interacted. Physical closeness was often particularly observable during
blank         | 
text          | media activities such as watching television or gathering around a smaller screen, when
blank         | 
text          | parents cuddled side-by-side with children on a sofa or bed, or children enjoyed sitting on
blank         | 
text          | a parent’s lap, but also in other moments of the day. Parents were also very observant of
blank         | 
text          | their children’s behavior and enforced limits where necessary, each in his or her own
blank         | 
text          | style.
blank         | 
text          |            All parents in the study deeply cared about their children’s education and
blank         | 
text          | strove to support them in their efforts, which sometimes meant restricting media time.

blank         | 
text          | examples of technology-supported homework help). Three of the mothers volunteered at
blank         | 
text          | their children’s school regularly. In addition, as children were progressing through
blank         | 
text          | Spanish-language pathway programs in their elementary schools, their schoolwork in
blank         | 
text          | English would be increasing with each year. As seen in some of the case portraits,
blank         | 
text          | parents who did not possess English fluency were motivated to improve their English by
blank         | 
text          | the desire to support their children with their schoolwork. The quantitative survey data
blank         | 
text          | also reflects this common value among parents; all parents indicated that teachers were
blank         | 
text          | “very important” in providing the lessons children needed to learn. This belief in the
blank         | 
text          | importance of their children’s schooling and desire to support it reflects the values of
blank         | 
text          | families documented in other studies of Hispanic-Latino immigrant families (e.g. Valdés,
blank         | 
text          | 1983; Katz, 2007; Goldenberg, 1987).
blank         | 
text          |            In terms of English language and technology fluency overall fathers felt more
blank         | 
text          | confident with English than did mothers in the study, but this pattern was not reflected in
blank         | 
text          | parents’ expressed comfort with or use of technology. As indicated in the previous
blank         | 
text          | chapter in Table 2a, all fathers were worked in blue-collar jobs, which did not require
blank         | 
text          | advanced knowledge of technology. Only two fathers used computers in their jobs – José
blank         | 
text          | Rubén Orozco to enter scheduling requests at his job at a discount supermarket, and
blank         | 
text          | César Rivera to email with clients of the steel manufacturing plant where he worked. All
blank         | 
text          | fathers expressed that they had acquired at least some basic proficiency in English
blank         | 
text          | through their work, although some had more limited opportunities to do so because there
blank         | 
text          | were few English speakers among their daily coworkers. Among the mothers, however,
blank         | 
text          | at the outset of the study six of the seven did not feel comfortable speaking English in

text          | most situations, although to varying degrees they were familiar with some English
blank         | 
text          | vocabulary and even used certain phrases in their own speech, such as “anyway” or
blank         | 
text          | “good job” instead of the Spanish equivalent. The seventh mother, Rebeca Rivera, was
blank         | 
text          | the only mother who regularly used English in her job(s), and was more confident in her
blank         | 
text          | ability to communicate in the language. When it came to technology, there was variation
blank         | 
text          | in terms of who in the family appeared to have most confidence. In some cases mothers
blank         | 
text          | were more avid and savvy users of technology than were fathers, as with Érica Martínez
blank         | 
text          | and Karina Parra. In other cases the reverse was true – mothers Carmen Orozco and
blank         | 
text          | Lorena Aguirre each felt their husbands had a stronger grasp of technology and often
blank         | 
text          | deferred to them for support. Finally, in some families both parents showed equal
blank         | 
text          | confidence and/or were had specific activities such as online shopping, using translator
blank         | 
text          | apps or web searching that they were particularly fluent with, as was evident in the
blank         | 
text          | Acosta family.
blank         | 
text          |           Parents’ levels of formal schooling varied widely across families and in some
blank         | 
text          | cases within families. It was the case that the three parents who had studied at the
blank         | 
text          | university level were among the most savvy with technology, and the family where both
blank         | 
text          | parents had least formal schooling were the least comfortable with technology tools.
blank         | 
text          | However, there were other parents in the study such as Érica Martínez, who did not have
blank         | 
text          | advanced levels of formal schooling and also used technology in sophisticated ways. It
blank         | 
text          | was difficult to observe relationships between parents’ comfort with technology and the
blank         | 
text          | nature of their jobs, because overall even the most educated and/or tech-savvy parents
blank         | 
text          | were not employed in jobs that made use of their educational backgrounds or technology

text          |        Saúl Jr., who was was eight years old and David, six, had grown up in Mexico
blank         | 
text          | with their mother, Érica. They arrived in the U.S. just six months prior to participating in
blank         | 
text          | the study and rejoined Saúl Sr. – the boys’ father – who for many years had been
blank         | 
text          | providing for his wife and sons from afar. Unlike the other families portrayed in the
blank         | 
text          | study – who were more established and where children had grown up in the U.S. – Saúl
blank         | 
text          | Jr., David and Érica were still very much adjusting to life here.
blank         | 
text          |        Both Érica and Saúl Sr. are gentle-mannered and stout-statured; Érica is talkative,
blank         | 
text          | has an especially warm smile and laughs easily. Saúl, originally from the Chiapas region
blank         | 
text          | and Érica, a native of Veracruz, had met working in the Cancún hotel industry and
blank         | 
text          | immigrated to California together in the early 2000s. After having Saúl Jr., Érica
blank         | 
text          | returned to Mexico, gave birth to David, and the family had remained separated for most
blank         | 
text          | of the boys’ childhood. For the past ten years, Saúl has worked the “graveyard shift” six
blank         | 
text          | nights per week in the same local restaurant kitchen. During the day while Saúl slept,
blank         | 
text          | Érica cooked, shopped, did some handicrafts, and cared for their two boys before and
blank         | 
text          | after school. Érica is a practicing Christian and attended church services each Sunday
blank         | 
text          | with the children.
blank         | 
text          |        The family of four lived in a single room that Saúl had lived in for the past several
blank         | 
text          | years on his own. The room was part of a larger apartment shared with other tenants and
blank         | 
text          | was located in the thick of one of the city’s most urban and ethnically vibrant

blank         | 
text          | family otherwise spent their time at home inside this one small room which was tightly
blank         | 
text          | packed with personal belongings hanging or stored on shelves from floor to ceiling. In
blank         | 
text          | addition, because Saúl Sr. worked all night, six nights per week, he needed to sleep
blank         | 
text          | during the daytime and this was also influential in the family routine.
blank         | 
text          |        Between Érica and Saúl Sr. there were contrasts both in educational background
blank         | 
text          | and ways of using technology. Érica had completed a ninth-grade education (secundaria
blank         | 
text          | in México) while Saúl had completed primary school (primaria, up to third grade). Érica
blank         | 
text          | played a central role in managing technology for the family as well as in supporting the
blank         | 
text          | boys in their schooling, and demonstrated resourcefulness in leveraging media tools,
blank         | 
text          | whereas Saúl Sr.’s media activities were more basic.
blank         | 
text          |        Saúl Jr. and David are both lively and curious, slightly shy boys who share a love
blank         | 
text          | of video games and superheroes. Saúl Jr. has an artistic sensibility and loves drawing and
blank         | 
text          | puppetry; he became involved in the latter through a tutoring program. The little available
blank         | 
text          | wall space in the family home was decorated with his pinned up artwork. Saúl Jr. also
blank         | 
text          | loved reading. Although both boys enjoyed video game play, Saúl tended to lose interest
blank         | 
text          | after some time playing and turned to drawing or other activities. David was a more avid
blank         | 
text          | gamer – he could launch into long explanations of the games he used, and his mother
blank         | 
text          | sometimes lamented that it was difficult to pry him away from playing. They also
blank         | 
text          | enjoyed swimming at community pools in the neighborhood.
blank         | 
text          |        At the beginning of the study Saúl and David spoke and understood less English
blank         | 
text          | than children in the other case families (all raised in this country). As Érica, Saúl Jr. and
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | from their living space. There were also feelings of success, for example, at our first visit
blank         | 
text          | eight-year-old Saúl Jr. expressed he did not speak English at all. At the final visit, six
blank         | 
text          | months later, he told me he felt “ahora siento que casi hablo dos idiomas” (“now I feel I
blank         |

text          |        The Martinez’ had the least developed local support network, with no nearby
blank         | 
text          | relatives or close allies. Upon arrival, Érica enrolled the boys in local public school (in
blank         | 
text          | the Spanish-English “biliteracy” program) – David in the first grade and Saúl in third
blank         | 
text          | grade. The school community emerged as an important source of contacts and
blank         | 
text          | information for Érica and the boys.
blank         | 
text          |        Érica, originally from the historic port city of Veracruz, worked in a Cancún hotel
blank         | 
text          | when she first met Saúl, who had migrated there from rural Chiapas. On many occasions
blank         | 
text          | during our visits, Érica expressed her nostalgia for the Yucatán, and particularly Veracruz
blank         | 
text          | where she and the boys had recently spent a year living with relatives. She deeply felt the
blank         | 
text          | contrast between what she described as a relatively happy and carefree life there, and
blank         | 
text          | their new experiences in the United States. Érica reminisced about historic and
blank         | 
text          | picturesque Veracruz, about how the boys spent hours each day playing outside and on
blank         | 
text          | the nearby beach, or even in the streets. In contrast, their new life felt cramped, with the
blank         | 
text          | four family members living inside a small room in a run-down apartment. The urban
blank         | 
text          | environment seemed stifling to Érica; the family did not own a car although the

title         | Home infrastructure and media routines
blank         | 
text          |        Although the Martínez family home was the smallest of any of the families’ living
blank         | 
text          | spaces and least private, it was similar to how other families described their lodgings
blank         | 
text          | when they were more recently arrived in the country – rented rooms inside of larger
blank         | 
text          | apartments shared with other families or individuals. The building where the family lived
blank         | 
text          | is located above a small grocery on a busy main drag populated by Latino markets, dollar
blank         | 
text          | stores, pawn shops, taquerías and pupuserías. Although the Martínez family was
blank         | 
text          | permitted to use the apartment’s living room area and did make use of the kitchen for
blank         | 
text          | preparing food, they seemed to avoid lingering in the common spaces and kept to
blank         | 
text          | themselves inside their own room. Érica and the children spoke very little English at the
blank         | 
text          | start of the study, and none of the other tenants spoke Spanish.
blank         | 
text          |        Due to Saúl (Sr.)’s work schedule – he began work around midnight and arrived
blank         | 
text          | home around 10 am – and the family’s constrained living space, Érica often needed to
blank         | 
text          | find daytime activities for the boys outside the home so that their father could rest.
blank         | 
text          | During these times (particularly on non-school days) Erica made the public library, which
blank         | 
text          | was within walking distance, into an outgrowth of their home. The children’s wing of the
blank         | 
text          | library is equipped with desktop computers and Internet access specifically for children’s
blank         | 
text          | use, and using their library cards the boys were able to access a one-hour session (each on
blank         | 
text          | his own computer). They used this time to play online games, and then stayed at the
blank         | 
text          | library afterwards to browse books and DVDs, from which they were allowed to select

blank         |

text          |        The family underwent various changes over the course of six months, both in

text          | terms of technology infrastructure and family life. By the second visit the family had
blank         | 
text          | acquired a second smartphone with a cracked screen that Saúl Sr. found on the street. It
blank         | 
text          | did not have a functioning cellular connection, but its wi-fi capability still worked. The
blank         | 
text          | Martinez’ did not have high speed Internet access at the start of the study, but they were
blank         | 
text          | aware that many wireless networks existed around them in their dense urban
blank         | 
text          | neighborhood. To connect, the children often sat with the smartphone in the back corner
blank         | 
text          | of their apartment, near the two large windows that face the main street, where some
blank         | 
text          | open networks were available and enabled them to download games. Once the games
blank         | 
text          | were loaded onto the phone, they were able to play them offline. The family then
blank         | 
text          | repaired their broken laptop and began using it again during the 2nd month of visits (they
blank         | 
text          | were also able to get some limited Internet access on the laptop using available open
blank         | 
text          | networks). At this time, Érica learned of a local technology access program that offered

text          |        Rebeca Rivera is a lively, attractive twenty-eight-year-old mother with two
blank         | 
text          | daughters, seven-year-old Jessica and three-year-old Yelitza. Although Rebeca is
blank         | 
text          | separated from the children’s father, César, he played a large role in the girls’ lives and
blank         | 
text          | came to their home to be with them when Rebeca was working (though he lived
blank         | 
text          | elsewhere). Rebeca and César had immigrated together from their native region of
blank         | 
text          | Oaxaca, Mexico, and both Jessica and Yelitza were born in the U.S. Seven-year-old
blank         | 
text          | Jessica was especially excited about science and was also an avid fan of Monster High, a
blank         | 
text          | cartoon show set in a high school for monster characters. She was enrolled in a full-day
blank         | 
text          | summer program and was preparing to begin second grade in the Spanish dual immersion
blank         | 
text          | program she had attended since kindergarten. Jessica’s spirited three-year-old sister
blank         | 
text          | Yelitza was at home with her mother full time until about half way through data
blank         | 
text          | collection, when she was accepted off the wait list for a full time spot in local public
blank         | 
text          | preschool program.
blank         | 
text          |        Although Rebeca was not much younger than other mothers in the study, her
blank         | 
text          | slender frame and youthful energy sometimes made her appear so. She had completed 9th
blank         | 
text          | grade (secundaria) in Mexico and tried diligently to further her own education, taking
blank         | 
text          | GED classes whenever her schedule would allow, but she often had to interrupt her
blank         | 
text          | studies due to work and childcare schedules. Rebeca rested little and was often on the go,
blank         | 
text          | between taking care of Yelitza during the day (before she enrolled in preschool), working

blank         | 
text          | during the day while also spending full days caring for Yelitza and after-school hours
blank         | 
text          | with Jessica. The night cleaning job was seasonal, so Rebeca also worked weekends at a
blank         | 
text          | local restaurant for more steady income. When she eventually secured a public preschool
blank         | 
text          | spot for Yelitza, Rebeca made several job changes in an attempt to secure daytime hours
blank         | 
text          | instead of nights and weekends, but didn’t reach this goal, at least during the study period.
blank         | 
text          |        When her cleaning job at the sports complex was not in season and she did not
blank         | 
text          | have work elsewhere, Rebeca used the time to take classes. She was the most proficient
blank         | 
text          | in English of the mothers in the study, and like César considered herself to have an
blank         | 
text          | intermediate level of English. Unlike most of the other mothers in the study, Rebeca
blank         | 
text          | spoke English regularly in her workplace at the restaurant. In addition, she had spent a
blank         | 
text          | short time in the U.S. as a teenager, staying with her uncle, after which she returned to
blank         | 
text          | Mexico. Rebeca also demonstrated considerable comfort with technology. She used a
blank         | 
text          | variety of utilities on her iPhone including maps, online ad listings and bus schedules.
blank         | 
text          |        Although the family did not yet have a working computer, acquiring one was a
blank         | 
text          | goal Rebeca was working toward, and she was obtaining the components piece by piece.
blank         | 
text          | During the data collection period she received an older desktop computer tower from a
blank         | 
text          | friend and planned to buy a monitor and keyboard to complete it. Rebeca specifically
blank         | 
text          | planned to use the computer for English practice with “Rosetta Stone” software.

text          |        Jessica is a sweet-tempered girl with thoughtful brown eyes who wanted to be a
blank         | 
text          | scientist and was quite conversant in both English and Spanish. She explored science at
blank         | 
text          | home via books that she brought from school or that she and her mother found at the
blank         | 
text          | library, including a science activity book that explained how to make baking soda

blank         | 
text          | language abilities were a source of pride for Rebeca; young Yelitza’s language
blank         | 
text          | development was more concerning to her as she felt Yelitza was learning more English
blank         | 
text          | than Spanish. Jessica was patient with her three-year-old sister Yelitza, who was
blank         | 
text          | sometimes mischievous with her sister’s things and could be hard to negotiate with.
blank         | 
text          |        Although the girls’ father César did not reside with them, he regularly came to the
blank         | 
text          | apartment where Rebeca and the girls lived to take care of the girls during Rebeca’s night
blank         | 
text          | and weekend work hours. César’s job at a sheet metal manufacturing company occupied
blank         | 
text          | him during weekday business hours. He spent the day with the girls on Saturdays and
blank         | 
text          | Sundays, often out and about town, while Rebeca worked at the restaurant. On the nights
blank         | 
text          | when Rebeca was out working graveyard shifts cleaning at the sports complex, César
blank         | 
text          | stayed the night with the children. The girls were clearly attached to him, and often
blank         | 
text          | showered him with affection when he arrived at the apartment to stay with them or take
blank         | 
text          | them on an excursion. Rebeca described difficulties in the couple’s former life together
blank         | 
text          | and in their separation, however in spite of conflicts César and Rebeca appeared to
blank         | 
text          | maintain a relatively cordial relationship and collaborated as necessary to co-parent their

text          | Rebeca often went to Costco with one of her comadres who had a car and gave her a ride
blank         | 
text          | so that she could get the bulk discounts but would not need to lug home heavy bags on

blank         | 
text          | especially to watch videos on YouTube, and after the TV was gone the phones were their
blank         | 
text          | primary source for media. Some examples of the video programs Yelitza enjoyed on
blank         | 
text          | YouTube (and that Jessica had also watched as a younger child) included Dora the
blank         | 
text          | Explorer, Go Diego Go! and Superwhy. The girls were four years apart in age, and often
blank         | 
text          | they were not interested in watching the same shows, either because of different interests
blank         | 
text          | or because they each wanted to establish control over what was being watched. At
blank         | 
text          | almost seven years old, Jessica now preferred watching programs with an older target
blank         | 
text          | audience, including Monster High and My Little Pony. The girls also played app games
blank         | 
text          | such as “Candy Crush,” “Tango,” and a Barbie-themed doll dress-up game, and Jessica
blank         | 
text          | played a chess app. Yelitza, only three years old, often had trouble sharing devices with

text          |        Rebeca found that she needed media to help occupy her daughters, but had

text          | misgivings about using it this way. She described how due to her nocturnal work shifts,
blank         | 
text          | she often needed to rest during the day and media was often a stop-gap measure that
blank         | 
text          | helped entertain the children. This practice displeased Rebeca, but she saw few
blank         | 
text          | alternatives since she could not forego sleep completely. “No me gusta tanto que estén
blank         | 
text          | pegadas ahí,” she explained. I don’t like them to be glued there. The educational value
blank         | 
text          | she saw in the media she chose helped her to feel better about this practice, and feel that

blank         | 
text          |           Sara and Manuel Morales are both originally from small pueblos in Michoacán,
blank         | 
text          | Mexico, and met in the United States. Their six-year-old daughter Estela was born here,
blank         | 
text          | and ever since her birth the family has lived in the same apartment in Lakewood, a low-
blank         | 
text          | income/working-class neighborhood located toward the outskirts of the city. Both Sara
blank         | 
text          | and Manuel work full-time – she as a house cleaner, and he as a construction worker.
blank         | 
text          | Estela had completed kindergarten prior to the study; when visits began she was on
blank         | 
text          | school vacation awaiting the start of first grade. Estela is enrolled in the first grade
blank         | 
text          | Spanish immersion program at Foxon elementary, located a few miles away. The family
blank         | 
text          | speaks exclusively Spanish at home, and Estela’s exposure to English has been largely at
blank         | 
text          | school among her schoolmates. Although many of them also speak Spanish and school
blank         | 
text          | instruction is mainly in Spanish, Estela’s parents reported that Estela interacted with her
blank         | 
text          | school friends mainly in English. Estela also speaks English during visits to her uncle
blank         | 
text          | (Sara’s brother) who lives not far away, and whose wife and children (Estela’s aunt and
blank         | 
text          | cousins) speak mostly English at home.
blank         | 
text          |        The Morales’ street in Lakewood is less urban than the El Valle thoroughfares where
blank         | 
text          | the Martínez,’ Parras and Aguirres live. There is one main avenue along Lakewood’s
blank         | 
text          | western edge that features the majority of the area storefronts, restaurants and public
blank         | 
text          | transit. Outside of this main street, Lakewood consists mostly of houses, sprinkled with
blank         | 
text          | churches, schools and other community establishments but little commerce. The
blank         | 
text          | neighborhood has been historically African-American, but its makeup is gradually

blank         | 
text          | American and other groups. Although gangs and street violence are present in El Valle
blank         | 
text          | and Park Terrace as well, in the Lakewood district it is more palpable.

text          |        The Morales’ live in a house that appears to have previously been a single-family
blank         | 
text          | residence, now divided into three apartments (one per floor). There is a low gate at
blank         | 
text          | sidewalk level, one leading to a small front patio with a number of children’s toys and
blank         | 
text          | vehicles (tricycles, play cars, etc.) and a few cement steps that lead to the front door of
blank         | 
text          | the Morales’ two-bedroom apartment. To offset the rent, the family has an adult female
blank         | 
text          | “roommate,” a woman from Sara’s home pueblo who works late during the week but
blank         | 
text          | sometimes interacts with the family at home on weekends. There are three units in the
blank         | 
text          | house – the Morales’ apartment on the ground level, another Mexican-origin family in an
blank         | 
text          | apartment beneath them on the basement/garden level, and a third family’s apartment is
blank         | 
text          | located above them. On my first visit to the Morales home, six-year-old Estela was
blank         | 
text          | playing upstairs with the neighbors girls, who are four and seven years old. The two
blank         | 
text          | families have a friendly relationship and the children play together often.
blank         | 
text          |        The Morales’ main living space opens up to the left of the front entrance, while
blank         | 
text          | straight ahead a hallway leads to the bedrooms and bathroom. The bedroom Sara,
blank         | 
text          | Manuel and Estela share is at the rear of the house at the end of the hall, while their
blank         | 
text          | housemate occupies the front-facing bedroom. On one end of the living area, a large
blank         | 
text          | window facing the front patio and street flanks a futon sofa, shelves and several leafy
blank         | 
text          | plants form a sitting area. On the other end of the room is the kitchen, and in between the
blank         | 
text          | two is a small dining table with chairs. At the beginning of the study, the refrigerator was
blank         | 
text          | placed between the living area and kitchen, with the television was perched on top of it

blank         | 
text          |        For the Morales family, proximity to Sara’s brother, his wife and two children is
blank         | 
text          | an important source of support. Sara initially immigrated to the US to help care for her
blank         | 
text          | first nephew (now nine years old), and lived with her brother and sister-in-law until she
blank         | 
text          | met Manuel and the two started their own household together. The two families visit
blank         | 
text          | each other regularly and Estela is close to her slightly older cousins. Sara describes her
blank         | 
text          | brother’s family as predominantly English-speaking and notes that Estela speaks English
blank         | 
text          | with her aunt and cousins exclusively.
blank         | 
text          |        Sara’s brother and his family are influential in the Morales’ knowledge and
blank         | 
text          | exposure to different types of media. They have a broader range of technology at home
blank         | 
text          | including wireless Internet, a Netflix subscription and an iPad. Estela uses these resources
blank         | 
text          | with her cousins during her regular visits to their home, either with her parents or on the
blank         | 
text          | occasional school vacation days when her parents are working. The first game Sara had
blank         | 
text          | on her smartphone was downloaded by her nephew (unbeknownst to Sara, initially).
blank         | 
text          | More details on this relationship and technology brokering are shared in Chapter Five.

blank         | 
text          | activities and did not own a computer or have Internet access. Prior to receiving the iPad,
blank         | 
text          | the Morales’ media routine consisted predominantly of watching television and using
blank         | 
text          | Facebook. Facebook was an adult activity, although sometimes Estela liked to scroll
blank         | 
text          | through her mother’s feed (see Chapter Six).
blank         | 
text          | Sara and Manuel had owned smartphones for about a year, and reported using them for
blank         | 
text          | only a few main purposes such as calling and social media. Estela used her mother’s cell
blank         | 
text          | phone sometimes to watch YouTube videos, although the cellular connection at home
blank         | 
text          | was sometimes too slow. Manuel expressed that in general he did not like technology,
blank         | 
text          | and had concerns about Estela gaining access to the Internet, but new tools had peaked
blank         | 
text          | his interest. He had recently begun videoconferencing with family in Mexico and
blank         | 
text          | discovered a new level of connection that way. Manuel and Sara also recognized that
blank         | 
text          | technology was useful and important for Estela in her future education, and that it could
blank         | 
text          | also help them as adults improve their English. Manuel had heard about Rosetta Stone at
blank         | 
text          | work and was interested in acquiring it but unclear what technology requirements it had.
blank         | 
text          | Other than the morning cartoons Estela watched each day, most of the television they
blank         | 
text          | watched was in Spanish. Sara viewed this as a “problem,” and felt they were not learning
blank         | 
text          | as much English as they could from media.

blank         | 
text          | bedroom), Sara and Manuel each had an Android smartphone, and they also had an
blank         | 
text          | Android tablet which they reported having used very little, only to store and view a small
blank         | 
text          | selection of photos. At the outset, the family did not have cable nor Internet access, but
blank         | 
text          | they were able to view several public channels including the Spanish-language
blank         | 
text          | broadcasters on their living room and bedroom televisions. Roughly halfway through the
blank         | 
text          | study, the family’s “roommate” requested that they install cable TV, as she was bored of
blank         | 
text          | the publically available channels. They installed cable in her room and in the Morales’
blank         | 
text          | bedroom, and from then on Manuel enjoyed watching wrestling, mixed martial arts,
blank         | 
text          | soccer and other cable sports programs in addition to the public channels. The cable
blank         | 
text          | installation did not appear to affect Sara and Estela much however; they continued to
blank         | 
text          | watch the same programs on the living room TV, which was not cable-connected.
blank         | 
text          |        Sara was interested in installing an Internet connection, but by the end of the
blank         | 
text          | study she hadn’t succeeded in arranging this with the provider. The company insisted
blank         | 
text          | that their address was listed as a single-family house, and the fact that the Morales’
blank         | 
text          | downstairs neighbor already had an account supposedly meant that they could not
blank         | 
text          | establish a second account at the same address. In this way, the Morales’ case illustrated
blank         | 
text          | how even a family desiring to install and pay for an Internet connection may not always
blank         | 
text          | be successful in arranging it.
blank         | 
text          |        With Sara working full-time, Estela enrolled in an after-school program, and an
blank         | 
text          | all-day program during the summer, the family’s time at home during the week is limited
blank         | 
text          | to a quick preparation time in the mornings before school and work, and the evenings,

blank         | 
text          | goes to bed. The family had a regular television routine that began with El Chavo del
blank         | 
text          | Ocho during dinner. Afterwards, Manuel was often watching television alone in the
blank         | 
text          | bedroom while Sara and Estela watched together in the living room. Spanish language
blank         | 
text          | news, reality television and novelas were the typical evening selections. The family
blank         | 
text          | watched daily morning cartoons on PBSKids, but otherwise at home the family mainly
blank         | 
text          | watched television in Spanish on U.S.-based channels such as Telemundo and MundoFox.
blank         |

text          | Acosta speaks some English, but considers himself unable to read or write in the
blank         | 
text          | language. Natalia sees her English skills as very basic and she is shy about speaking.
blank         | 
text          | During the time of data collection, when Amanda began kindergarten, Natalia began
blank         | 
text          | making a concerted effort to study English, looking ahead to supporting her daughters’
blank         | 
text          | future schoolwork. Studying English had been a sore point for Natalia for some time –
blank         | 
text          | she felt discouraged from trying to learn after being poorly treated by the teacher of her
blank         | 
text          | first English class when she arrived in the US. Supporting her daughters was a powerful
blank         | 
text          | motivator though, and soon after Amanda started kindergarten Natalia enrolled in two
blank         | 
text          | English classes, one at a community-based organization for families and one at a local
blank         | 
text          | church, as well as a computer skills course that was also offered at the church.

text          |        The Acosta family lives in Lakewood, although their location is more removed
blank         | 
text          | section farther from local amenities than the Morales’ home. Miguel drives to work in
blank         | 
text          | the family’s minivan early each morning; Natalia gets up with the girls, gets them ready,
blank         | 
text          | and navigates the local bus system to take Amanda to school (located in a more affluent
blank         | 
text          | section of town), attend her English classes at and run errands. The family home is on
blank         | 
text          | the ground floor of a house and resembles a two-room studio. There is an eat-in kitchen
blank         | 
text          | with a small bathroom, and an adjoining bedroom where all four family members sleep –
blank         | 
text          | the adults in a full-size bed and the girls in bunk beds. The bedroom also contains a large
blank         | 
text          | media cabinet with a television and sound system, and family most often watches TV
blank         | 
text          | sitting on or near the full-size bed. The Acostas share their kitchen with two Latino men
blank         | 
text          | who live in the two bedrooms downstairs at garden level. The living arrangement only
blank         | 
text          | feels shared to a certain extent, as the Acostas’ “roommates” keep mostly to themselves

text          | to the Acostas’ bedroom, and pass through the kitchen when coming or going. In
blank         | 
text          | addition, there is separate full apartment on the upstairs floor of the house occupied by
blank         | 
text          | another family. A highlight of the Acosta home is the large, well-tended backyard,
blank         | 
text          | reached by descending a staircase off the kitchen. The grass and flowering plants provide
blank         | 
text          | a pleasant setting for the children’s play and the family enjoys planting and gardening.

blank         | 
text          | sometimes on major holidays, and some other relatives in New York. During the course
blank         | 
text          | of the study, the Acostas learned that Mónica, an eighteen-year-old cousin of theirs, had
blank         | 
text          | returned to California to live with her father, after growing up in El Salvador with her
blank         | 
text          | mother. As a newcomer, Mónica was largely alone and enjoyed spending time with

text          | Natalia, Miguel and the children, even accompanying them on their car trip to visit

text          | relatives in Oregon. She was also had more technology fluency in some ways than
blank         | 
text          | Miguel and Natalia, and at times helped them when they needed technology tips. Other

text          |          When the study began, evening television was a centerpiece of family time
blank         | 
text          | together, usually dominated by children’s programming in Spanish or English. The
blank         | 
text          | television was equipped with a cable package that offered Spanish-language channels, as

text          | well as Spanish audio dubbing for some English-language programs. If available, Natalia
blank         | 
text          | and Miguel usually opted for these if they were watching together with the children. The
blank         | 
text          | single television in the household was located in the family bedroom (which doubled as a
blank         | 
text          | living room) and had a cable package that offered Spanish audio for a number of
blank         | 
text          | channels and programs as well as Salvadoran television stations. Each parent had an
blank         | 
text          | android smartphone, and the family also owned one PC laptop computer (which they kept
blank         | 
text          | in a closet and brought to the kitchen table for use), a small portable DVD player for long
blank         | 
text          | car trips, and a video camera. About six weeks into the study, they also acquired a Sony
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | shows on YouTube using the family’s laptop. Like most families in the study, they use
blank         | 
text          | Facebook to communicate and keep up-to-date with friends and family in other parts of
blank         | 
text          | the U.S. and in El Salvador. On Facebook, Natalia enjoyed sharing images with Christian
blank         | 
text          | messages or prayers, which she posted on her wall or directly to friends’ pages. The
blank         | 
text          | family used their video camera particularly on family outings or trips and as mentioned

text          | earlier, the girls enjoyed watching the home videos even long after they had been

text          | recorded.
blank         | 
text          |        Amanda and Susi watched children’s television daily, more so before the school
blank         | 
text          | year started but also during the school year before bedtime or if they were home after
blank         | 
text          | Amanda’s school day ended. They watched a mix of educational shows such as Dora the
blank         | 
text          | Explorer and other shows such as Las Chicas Superpoderosas (Power Puff Girls), Bubble
blank         | 
text          | Guppies and Jake and the Neverland Pirates. Miguel and Natalia valued evening
blank         | 
text          | television watching as time for the family to be together and share a relaxing activity.
blank         | 
text          | They usually divided the time between children’s shows and adult programs such as news
blank         | 
text          | or certain novelas that they felt were appropriate for the children to watch.
blank         | 
text          |        Amanda and Susi used screen media in the car on outings or road trips, as did
blank         | 
text          | some other children in the study. Particularly on long trips such as the one to Oregon,
blank         | 
text          | Miguel and Natalia tried to make sure that there was a selection of movies for the girls to

text          | watch on their portable DVD player. Natalia and Miguel preferred choosing television

text          | distract them while on the go, they tried to avoid it. They also felt that shows and videos,

text          | nights at a local supermarket. Carmen and José Rubén met in the US and their social and
blank         | 
text          | educational backgrounds in El Salvador were quite different. José Rubén completed a
blank         | 
text          | three semesters of college education in El Salvador and worked for several years as a
blank         | 
text          | police officer there. When he came to the U.S. he obtained refugee status based on his
blank         | 
text          | prior work with the police and the political unrest in his home country. In contrast,
blank         | 
text          | Carmen completed middle school, had three children at a young age, and came to the US

text          | to work and provide financial support for her mother and children. José Ruben also has

text          |          Prior to introducing the iPad, the Orozcos’ small apartment was already packed
blank         | 
text          | fairly densely with media devices. There are TVs in both bedrooms (a very small one in
blank         | 
text          | Brandon’s room and a larger flat screen in the parents’ room), as well as large flat screen
blank         | 
text          | TV in the living room. The family subscribes to the “Dish Latino” cable package which
blank         | 
text          | provides a range of Spanish language channels as well as Spanish audio for many English
blank         | 
text          | language channels. The family also has a desktop computer, in the corner of the living
blank         | 
text          | room that Brandon uses as well as a laptop, which the adults use, sometimes together
blank         | 
text          | with their son. Their cable service also includes wireless Internet, and both parents have
blank         | 
text          | smartphones. Additionally Brandon has a Nintendo DS with a variety of games. The
blank         | 
text          | family has markedly little time at home together because of parents’ opposite work
blank         | 
text          | schedules and Brandon’s full day school and after school activities. On the weekends
blank         | 
text          | however, they do enjoy some time together and often watch TV or movies as a family.

text          |        From the time when the study began, Brandon seemed accustomed to using media
blank         | 
text          | quite independently. This may be in part due to the fact that he is sometimes left to his
blank         | 
text          | own devices when at home with his father, who needs to rest during the day. For
blank         | 
text          | example, Carmen and José Rubén expected to enroll Brandon in the summer program at
blank         | 
text          | Brandon’s school between kindergarten and first grade, but the program was short-staffed
blank         | 
text          | and at the last minute he was not granted a space. As a result, Brandon spent those
blank         | 
text          | summer days at home with his father, who was often resting after a night shift while
blank         | 
text          | Brandon watched TV, played games on the computer, played games on the DS, and so on,
blank         | 
text          | in addition to playing with non-electronic toys and games. Brandon also rides along with
blank         | 
text          | his father in the family car when they go to pick Carmen up from work, and that is often a
blank         | 
text          | time when he plays games on his father’s phone.

blank         | 
text          |            Lorena and Eduardo Aguirre immigrated to California from rural Puebla,
blank         | 
text          | Mexico. Although their experience of immigrating across the border via coyote is similar
blank         | 
text          | to those of many other parents in the study, they are different in that they have the most
blank         | 
text          | formal education of the group. They are arguably the most “tech-savvy,” and live the
blank         | 
text          | most “middle-class” lifestyle. Lorena and Eduardo met at university – both were the first
blank         | 
text          | generation to attend college in their families. Eduardo pursued communications and
blank         | 
text          | Lorena international business. The couple immigrated to the U.S. with the dream of
blank         | 
text          | saving money with which to start a business in Mexico. Although Lorena in particular
blank         | 
text          | missed family sorely and longed to go back to Mexico, as of yet she and Eduardo felt
blank         | 
text          | they had not managed to save enough money to secure their and their children’s
blank         | 
text          | livelihood if they returned. Lorena is a stay-at-home mother caring for their two children,
blank         | 
text          | six-year-old Eduardo Jr. and eight-year-old Naomi, both U.S.-born. Although she had no
blank         | 
text          | formal employment, Lorena regularly provided after-school care for other children in
blank         | 
text          | their circle of friends and family (what payment she received for this, if any, is unclear).
blank         | 
text          | Eduardo is a carpenter; he leaves home daily by about six-thirty a.m. and returns in the
blank         | 
text          | evening, after which he often enjoys jogging, either by himself or with Eduardo Jr.

blank         | 
text          | hallway stretches past both of the small bedrooms before reaching the living room and
blank         | 
text          | adjacent kitchen. The floors are mostly covered in a very dark, low-pile carpet, but

text          | room an overstuffed sofa and armchair in the living room face the TV and game console,
blank         | 
text          | and the family often relaxes here after work and school. The kitchen accommodates a
blank         | 
text          | small wooden dining table, which was usually arranged neatly with a large bowl of fresh
blank         | 
text          | oranges, grapefruit, apples or other fruit that the children snacked on when they come
blank         | 
text          | home in the afternoons, sliced and sprinkled with lime and fresh chile powder.
blank         | 
text          |              Naomi, eight years old, has an outgoing personality and enjoys engaging others in
blank         | 
text          | conversation. She enjoys reading, crafts and playing the role of reporter and producing
blank         | 
text          | her own media (discussed at several points in the chapters that follow). Six-year-old
blank         | 
text          | Eduardo Jr. is an avid sports fan – he enjoys physically playing sports, watching sports,
blank         | 
text          | and playing sports-themed apps or games. He also enjoys being a collaborator on the

text          | children’s interests, enrolling Eduardo Jr. in sports activities whenever possible and
blank         | 
text          | stimulating Naomi’s interest in communication and creative pursuits. While the children
blank         | 
text          | enjoyed producing media together, they often differed in the media content they each

text          | played a role in shaping Naomi and Eduardo Jr.’s media interests to some extent, as
blank         | 
text          | discussed in Chapter Five. The families also socialized and supported one another in a
blank         | 
text          | variety of ways. Besides these family members, the Aguirres had a community of friends
blank         | 
text          | they socialized with and could consult for information or advice. Lorena was also
blank         | 
text          | involved to some extent in the children’s school community; she participated in a parent
blank         | 
text          | leadership training at an organization linked to the children’s school, and took English
blank         | 
text          | classes that were offered at the school itself specifically for parents. During one visit,
blank         | 
text          | Lorena asked me whether Stanford University was open to the public for people to visit.
blank         | 
text          | At her leadership training, Lorena had learned to some extent about college access and
blank         | 
text          | parents were encouraged to take their children to see local universities and begin to view
blank         | 
text          | them as something within their reach, and Lorena was interested in taking them to

title         | Technology inventory and media routines

text          |        The Aguirre family had a wide array of media devices in their home when the
blank         | 
text          | study began. There was a large flat-screen TV in their living room, and initially a
blank         | 
text          | desktop Apple computer (iMac) on a small desk in the corner there as well. Each parent
blank         | 
text          | has a personal iPhone, Naomi has an iPod touch, and Eduardo had given Lorena an iPad
blank         | 
text          | for her birthday a few months prior. Connected to the family TV was a Wii console,
blank         | 
text          | which the family used for games and to stream shows and movies on Netflix. Part way
blank         | 
text          | through the study they also acquired an Apple TV. The Aguirres appeared to have a
blank         | 
text          | preference for Apple devices, whereas other families chose other brands (two other

blank         | 
text          | or iPads). Unlike some of the families with fewer devices, the Aguirres do not subscribe
blank         | 
text          | to cable television. In addition to publically accessible TV channels, they access content
blank         | 
text          | via Netflix, DVDs and YouTube. Eduardo Sr. feels cable TV is unnecessary with this
blank         | 
text          | multitude of other platforms available. Eduardo has a particular interest in independent
blank         | 
text          | cinema and he and Lorena enjoy the options available on Netflix streaming, while the
blank         | 
text          | children enjoyed a range of kids’ programs on Netflix and YouTube as well. On the Wii,

text          | Eduardo Jr. likes to play Skylander, either on his own or with his older cousin when he
blank         |

text          | in the study (watching Spanish and English language television, using online translators
blank         | 
text          | and mobile games, for example) they also took advantage of media in some more
blank         | 
text          | advanced ways as compared to other case families. For example Eduardo uses Twitter,

text          | Lorena entered sweepstakes and won concert tickets on a radio station website, they use
blank         | 
text          | skype to communicate with family members, and the children knew how to search for

text          | a lot of “educational” media.
blank         | 
text          |        As shared in Chapter Seven, Eduardo valued media production and the arts, and
blank         | 
text          | encouraged the children to use media to express themselves. The family enjoyed taking
blank         | 
text          | photos and home movies, and Naomi sometimes directed her own “talk shows” using her
blank         | 
text          | iPod touch, which her younger brother participated in as well (see Chapter Five). Naomi

text          | and Eduardo were enrolled in a Spanish immersion program at a nearby public

text          | homework in Spanish, but Naomi, in the third grade, had been introduced to more
blank         | 
text          | English instruction and regularly brought home homework in English. Lorena, who was

text          | had opted to keep Bryanna in afternoon care in case she were to get a job.
blank         | 
text          |        During the time of the study, Karina was going through a period of introspection,
blank         | 
text          | and expressed during visits that she felt depressed and missed her family deeply. She
blank         | 
text          | was strongly affected when her father in Perú fell ill. She felt trapped – unable to travel
blank         | 
text          | to be at his side without giving up the life she has built in the US. Her husband Jorge,
blank         | 
text          | Bryanna’s father, is Nicaraguan and had no desire to move to Perú, where he has no ties
blank         | 
text          | and has never lived. This theme came up several times during our visits and was clearly
blank         | 
text          | at the forefront of Karina’s mind during much of this time. Karina also suffered panic

blank         | 
text          | have her deported if she did not transfer them a large sum of money. Members of the
blank         | 
text          | school community were able to assuage Karina’s fears and convince her the threats were
blank         | 
text          | fabricated, but Karina was badly shaken by the experience. Karina has a passion for
blank         | 
text          | decorating and holiday celebrations, and threw herself into preparations, first and
blank         | 
text          | foremost for Bryanna’s sixth birthday party. However, once her father’s became ill
blank         | 
text          | Karina was diverting what little money the family could spare to help cover medical costs
blank         | 
text          | in Perú, and family celebrations even at Christmas were more subdued.
blank         | 
text          |        Like the Aguirre and Martínez families, the Parras live in the El Valle
blank         | 
text          | neighborhood, on one of the area’s bustling main avenues. One of many in a fairly large
blank         | 
text          | building, their one-bedroom apartment is tucked away behind the lobby on the ground
blank         | 
text          | floor, much as a superintendent’s quarters might be in some buildings. The apartment
blank         | 
text          | entryway is a long hallway with doors to the bedroom (shared by Bryanna and her
blank         | 
text          | parents), a bathroom and then finally an open living space with a kitchen area along one
blank         | 
text          | wall and on the other, a window facing the rear of the building. Although the apartment
blank         | 
text          | is small, Karina kept spaces clear and clutter-free by making use of overhead shelves and
blank         | 
text          | spaces for storage, especially for her many seasonal holiday decorations. In the family
blank         | 
text          | bedroom, Bryanna’s love of media characters takes center stage. The walls are plastered
blank         | 
text          | with media-themed decals such as Dora the Explorer and the entire array of Disney
blank         | 
text          | princesses, as well as an electronic talking Snow White mirror. Bryanna’s closet is
blank         | 
text          | stocked with Disney costume outfits. The room reflected both Bryanna’s love of media
blank         | 
text          | characters and her mother’s dedication to delighting her daughter as much as she could –
blank         | 
text          | not to mention Karina’s flair for decorating.

blank         | 
text          | TV was equipped with an extensive cable package that included international channels
blank         | 
text          | from Central America and Peru. The family also owned a game console they used
blank         | 
text          | occasionally. Each parent had a smartphone and Bryanna had her own smartphone (not
blank         | 
text          | equipped with cellular service) that she used mainly for listening to music. Bryanna also
blank         | 
text          | had a “Nabi” children’s tablet that included an array of pre-installed games as well as
blank         |

text          | of a shrine to the little girl, decorated with numerous large portraits of her at different
blank         | 
text          | ages. Bryanna loves to draw, dance and play, both indoors with toys and outdoors.
blank         | 
text          | Bryanna is also an avid fan of Disney and Pixar characters. For her birthday party each
blank         | 
text          | year, Bryanna chooses a particular Disney film and dresses as the main character (for her
blank         | 
text          | sixth birthday she chose the heroine from “Brave”). She also enjoyed excursions with
blank         | 
text          | her parents, which during the study included a road trip to Disneyland and a school
blank         | 
text          | camping trip.
blank         | 
text          |        Prior to receiving the iPad, the family described their media routine as beginning
blank         | 
text          | early in the morning, when Jorge got up and began watching news on Spanish-language
blank         | 
text          | television. When Bryanna awoke, she watched children’s shows on TV such as
blank         | 
text          | SpongeBob on Nickelodeon, or Sesame Street and others on PBSKids, sometimes
blank         | 
text          | accompanied by her father. In the evening prior to bedtime, Bryanna usually watched
blank         | 
text          | shows on Disney XD or via TV on demand that might include Dora the Explorer or other
blank         | 
text          | programs. Sometimes instead of children’s programming, parents’ TV choices would be
blank         | 
text          | on. These included Caso Cerrado (legal court reality show), news and soap operas.
blank         | 
text          | Karina has also maintained her connection to Perú watching Peruvian channels with news

text          | Karina showed Bryanna YouTube videos or TV programs of traditional Peruvian dances
blank         | 
text          | and celebrations to support her learning about those customs. Karina occasionally used a
blank         | 
text          | translator on her phone to help with words or phrases needed in everyday life. Although
blank         | 
text          | Bryanna’s media “diet” mainly consisted of TV, she also had a smattering of apps on her

blank         | 
title         | KNOWLEDGE-SEEKING ON THE INTERNET
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        Over the course of the study, families leveraged technology in a variety of ways
blank         | 
text          | to make sense of their environment, access meaning, further their knowledge and obtain
blank         | 
text          | information. This chapter shares several explicit and strategic ways that families sought
blank         | 
text          | instruction and various types of information using Internet technologies. As one might
blank         | 
text          | expect, parents made use of technology tools for practical purposes – mapping routes,
blank         | 
text          | anticipating weather, finding out when the next bus would arrive, and so on – but they
blank         | 
text          | also used Internet tools in sophisticated ways that supported their or their children’s
blank         | 
text          | learning and schoolwork. These observations offer examples of some of the possible
blank         | 
text          | connections between in- and out-of-school learning.
blank         | 
text          |        This chapter focuses on uses of media that involved explicit and active
blank         | 
text          | information- or instruction-seeking by parents and/or children, whereas Chapter Five
blank         | 
text          | focuses on media activities in the “leisure” space that also had important implications for
blank         | 
text          | language, literacy and learning. Of course, these two categories are not mutually
blank         | 
text          | exclusive and there are many ways that a knowledge-seeking activity can become playful
blank         | 
text          | (as seen in this chapter in the example of Naomi and Eduardo Aguirre using a translator
blank         | 
text          | app for playful exploration), and playful activities can lead to a quest for more
blank         | 
text          | information (as shown in Chapter Five). These categories are not meant as a dichotomy
blank         | 
text          | but rather as a way of highlighting families’ innovative practices for accessing meaning,
blank         | 
text          | information and support using media as well as the ways that media supported learning in
blank         | 
text          | less explicitly planned ways.

text          |         This chapter presents data to support a major finding of this study: family media
blank         | 
text          | practices among the seven case families were diverse and included resourceful strategies
blank         | 
text          | for using media for learning. I argue that families showed ingenuity “in tight
blank         | 
text          | circumstances” (McDermott & Raley, 2011) or inventos (Schwartz & Gutiérrez, 2013;
blank         | 
text          | Gutiérrez & Schwartz, forthcoming) by leveraging technology in innovative ways in
blank         | 
text          | situations of limited resources. To Gutiérrez and Schwartz’ words to describe it, families
blank         | 
text          | showed the “ingenuity that springs from present necessity and future goals” (forthcoming,
blank         | 
text          | p. 3). To illustrate in ways that particularly highlight these activities as they relate to
blank         | 
text          | language and literacy experiences, in the following examples I focus on the ways in
blank         | 
text          | which:
blank         | 
text          | I. Media facilitated ways of “bridging” home and school. This occurred through
blank         | 
text          |        three main sub-categories of use. First, families used translator apps to support
blank         | 
text          |        children’s schoolwork in English and to explore language a child encountered at
blank         | 
text          |        school; second, media acted as a means for deepening a child interest that was
blank         | 
text          |        sparked in school; and third, families used computer and mobile apps to strengthen
blank         | 
text          |        children’s academic skills including English language and reading.
blank         | 
text          | II. Parents used media to advance their own studies (often of English language) or
blank         | 
text          |        careers. This category includes: first, parents using translator apps for their own
blank         | 
text          |        English learning, to communicate in work-related situations; and second, parents
blank         | 
text          |        using free online video to access English instruction.
blank         | 
text          | The first two sections of the chapter share examples from each of these categories, while
blank         | 
text          | the final section of this chapter addresses frequency of these types of media use and

text          |                                        Media tools can be particularly powerful in allowing people to connect across
blank         | 
text          | settings and boundaries. The seven case families leveraged media tools to connect in
blank         | 
text          | multiple ways. Among these families, where all members were acquiring English at
blank         | 
text          | some level, media facilitated links between the home context, where Spanish was the
blank         | 
text          | dominant language, and children’s schools, where children were enrolled in Spanish
blank         | 
text          | language programs but English was used in some of the instruction as well as in many
blank         | 
text          | informal interactions. As mentioned above, the specific ways that families “bridged”
blank         | 
text          | home and school using media as a facilitator were:

text          | 1. families’ use of translator apps to understand children’s homework assignments in
blank         | 
text          |                           English and to explore words a child heard at school;
blank         | 
text          | 2. using Internet video to expand upon topics a child learned about and became
blank         | 
text          |                           interested in at school;
blank         | 
text          | 3. using computer and mobile apps to strengthen children’s academic skills including

text          |                           English language and reading.

blank         | 
text          | Families’ use of mobile translator apps to support children’s schoolwork
blank         | 
text          |        Throughout the study, the majority of parents spoke about and demonstrated how
blank         | 
text          | they used digital translator apps (chiefly Google Translate and iTranslate) for various
blank         | 
text          | purposes in their daily lives. As a subcode of the parent code “media as language learning
blank         | 
text          | resource,” translator apps emerged in the data as a commonly used technology that served
blank         | 
text          | several different purposes. The examples below highlight in particular the ways that
blank         | 
text          | translator programs on smartphones, computers and tablets supported families in
blank         | 
text          | understanding children’s homework instructions in English. In this way, translator apps
blank         | 
text          | acted as a “bridge” that facilitated parents’ attempts to access meaning from materials
blank         | 
text          | assigned at school in order to engage with the school-based learning activities children
blank         | 
text          | were involved in. Translator apps do not always provide accurate output, and in some
blank         | 
text          | instances they added confusion. At the same time, this activity between parents and
blank         | 
text          | children also allowed children to more successfully understand and complete the
blank         | 
text          | assignments, because parents accessed meaning from the texts and thus were able to
blank         | 
text          | support the task at hand. As shown in the examples, translator use involved and relied on
blank         | 
text          | both parent and child participation, and sometimes resulted in a collaborative meaning-
blank         | 
text          | making between the two.
blank         | 
text          |        Several parents in the study reported that they sometimes or often used translator
blank         | 
text          | apps (five mothers and three fathers). Most parents used Google Translate – available for
blank         | 
text          | both iOS and Android operating systems – and the Aguirre family had iTranslate on their
blank         | 
text          | iPad. Google Translate includes both audio input (voice recognition via microphone) and
blank         | 
text          | audio output (pronouncing words via speaker). The Android version of the app is also

blank         | 
text          | photographs of signs, menus or other text using the translator and the app will translate
blank         | 
text          | the words photographed into English, provided it can recognize them. As with many of
blank         | 
text          | the apps and resources they downloaded, most parents reported that they discovered
blank         | 
text          | translators through word of mouth. José Rubén Orozco, whose son Brandon participated
blank         | 
text          | in speech support sessions at school, reported that the speech specialist recommended
blank         | 
text          | using the app to explore vocabulary and word pronunciation (further discussed below).
blank         | 
text          | There was also evidence that children in the study viewed mobile devices as reference
blank         | 
text          | tools for looking up words, for example when the Rivera family received their iPad,
blank         | 
text          | seven-year-old Jessica immediately asked to use it to look up the Spanish equivalent for
blank         | 
text          | an English word she used with friends (“jelly bean”).
blank         | 
text          |        Parents used translator apps to help understand the children’s homework assigned in
blank         | 
text          | English, principally in the homes of the Aguirre and Martínez families, who had the two
blank         | 
text          | oldest children in the sample, both eight years old. All children were in Spanish
blank         | 
text          | immersion programs that focused on instruction in Spanish during the first years of
blank         | 
text          | school and gradually increased English instruction. As third graders, Naomi Aguirre and
blank         | 
text          | Saúl Martínez received more homework assignments in English than younger children.
blank         | 
text          | One of the first accounts I received of using the translator to understand homework
blank         | 
text          | instructions came from Érica Martínez. Her son Saúl sometimes received math
blank         | 
text          | homework in English and Érica downloaded Google translate for the purpose of

text          | As shown in Érica’s example, parents may not understand the Spanish translation that the
blank         | 
text          | translator generates, possibly because the translator has not accurately captured the
blank         | 
text          | meaning of the instructions, which may contain specific word usage that is less common
blank         | 
text          | in other contexts and thus “confuses” the translator. Another pitfall arises if the parent is
blank         | 
text          | not able to make sense of the translation even if it is correct, because he or she may be
blank         | 
text          | unfamiliar with the type of work the child is doing (just as an English speaking parent
blank         | 
text          | may not understand how to do a particular math activity). In the excerpt, Érica’s
blank         | 
text          | qualification “even though he is in third grade” seems to imply that she feels she doesn’t
blank         | 
text          | understand the actual activity, rather than attributing the issue to bad translation.
blank         | 
text          |        In some cases, however, the translation apps did play a role in supporting parents to
blank         | 
text          | understand the homework task at hand. The Aguirre family made particularly frequent
blank         | 
text          | use of translator apps (Google Translate and iTranslate) when eight-year-old Naomi was
blank         | 
text          | working on homework assignments in English. The field note excerpt below describes

blank         | 
text          | used a translator app to help understand homework instructions. The Aguirres were the
blank         | 
text          | only family that had an iPad prior to receiving one as part of the study, and during this
blank         | 
text          | visit they were using it to run the translator. They enjoyed using the iPad for the task
blank         | 
text          | instead of the iPhone because of the larger screen that facilitated entering text, seeing it
blank         | 
text          | clearly and sharing the screen together. The following example shows the way in which
blank         | 
text          | Lorena and Naomi leveraged the translator app to support their understanding of a two-
blank         | 
text          | part math word problem.

text          |        During this observation, eight-year-old Naomi and her mother Lorena were working
blank         | 
text          | with a pair of math word problems on a homework worksheet that Naomi had been
blank         | 
text          | assigned form homework. The word problems (shown in figure 4b) read: 1. The

blank         | 
text          | understand the problem and demonstrating to her mother that she understood the problem.
blank         | 
text          | Naomi succeeded in translating much of the wording deftly – for example, translating
blank         | 
text          | “paper,” which could be ambiguous, appropriately to “periódico,” which demonstrated
blank         | 
text          | that she comprehended at least some of the context as she was reading. She missed some
blank         | 
text          | meanings, however, for example the section of the newspaper was “18 pages long,” and
blank         | 
text          | Naomi translated it as 18 páginas largas [18 long pages], and neither she nor Lorena
blank         | 
text          | were able to make sense of the phrase “pages long.” Based on Naomi’s translation alone,
blank         | 
text          | Lorena was not able to fully grasp the problems, particularly the last lines where the key
blank         | 
text          | questions were posed (How many pages are in the paper? How much change should he
blank         | 
text          | get back [if paying 50 cents using a five dollar bill]?).
blank         | 
text          |        In order to understand the problems and be sure that she knew what they were
blank         | 
text          | asking, Lorena typed the key question at the end of the word problem into iTranslate on
blank         | 
text          | her iPad and translated it to Spanish. For the first question, Naomi had translated the
blank         | 
text          | meaning of the question correctly when she read it to her mother, but Lorena used the
blank         | 
text          | translator to in order to validate Naomi’s translation and reassure herself that they both

text          | From this point, Lorena was able to help Naomi reason through the math problem,

text          | focusing on the mathematical operation rather than on ambiguities in the language of the
blank         | 
text          | problem. In this instance, the translator app acted as a support that helped Lorena feel

text          | more confident she understood the homework instructions and helped enable her to guide
blank         |

              | 
text          | In this case, Lorena clearly calls out the value of the translator app and explicitly tries to
blank         | 
text          | instill in Naomi the strategy of first making sure she understands the problem and using
blank         | 
text          | the translator app as a tool if she is not sure (“Ah, well here is the… this”). In this way,
blank         | 
text          | Lorena not only used the translator app as a support for her own comprehension, but she
blank         | 
text          | modeled and explicitly encouraged this practice as something her daughter should do to
blank         | 
text          | clarify or confirm her understanding of text in a problem. Viewing this example from a
blank         | 
text          | Vygotskian perspective, the word problems were, mathematically and linguistically
blank         | 
text          | speaking, within Naomi’s zone of proximal development (ZPD), meaning that they were
blank         | 
text          | within the range of tasks she could accomplish alone or with help. However, while
blank         | 
text          | Lorena possessed the mathematical knowledge to support her daughter, she herself
blank         | 
text          | needed support to accomplish the task of deciphering the language of the word problems.
blank         | 
text          | In this case, the translator app was part of the repertoire of tools that Lorena, as the
blank         | 
text          | supporting adult in the situation, enlisted both to enable herself to guide Naomi, but also
blank         | 
text          | to introduce to Naomi as a form of support she could draw on herself.
blank         | 
text          |              Using the translator app to make sense of homework instructions was not
blank         | 
text          | always so straightforward. In addition to their affordances for facilitating homework
blank         | 
text          | support, the translator apps also came with some limitations, which parents had become
blank         | 
text          | familiar with. For example, if a single word is entered into the translator, it may offer
blank         | 
text          | various possible equivalents to choose from, but it is not very useful or efficient to
blank         | 
text          | translate a sentence word-by-word. On the other hand, if one enters a sentence or
blank         | 
text          | paragraph in, the program will try to deduce, based on the context, which definition of the
blank         |

              |

              | 	  
text          | word to use. When translating words have multiple meanings, the translator apps did not
blank         | 
text          | always choose the one that best fit; in fact, sometimes they added confusion by choosing
blank         | 
text          | a meaning that was far off the mark.
blank         | 
text          |            This issue sometimes resulted in confusion for families and this arose for
blank         | 
text          | Lorena and Naomi while they worked on a homework assignment that was in English,
blank         | 
text          | but also was for English (class). A dictionary entry provided a basis for the exercise. The
blank         | 
text          | dictionary entry was the word “duck” and the definitions covered the multiple meanings
blank         | 
text          | including the noun (animal) and the verb (as in to “duck down”). The exercise included
blank         | 
text          | reading sentences with the word “duck” and identifying which definition applied in each
blank         | 
text          | case. For example, one item read: “We can fool my brother if we duck under the table.
blank         | 
text          | Duck means _______________.” The item required students to provide the appropriate
blank         | 
text          | definition from the dictionary entry that suits the context of the sentence.
blank         | 
text          |            The task presented multiple challenges. The notion of a single word with
blank         | 
text          | more than one definition (not obviously related) was unfamiliar ground. First, Lorena
blank         | 
text          | suggested Naomi search for the word in her hardcover English dictionary (not a Spanish-
blank         | 
text          | English dictionary). However the entry in the dictionary was similar to the homework
blank         | 
text          | exercise and did not advance them toward understanding what to do. Lorena reached for
blank         | 
text          | the iPad and began to enter the “duck” definitions to help make sense of the instructions.
blank         | 
text          | While in this case the translator app did help Lorena to understand some of what was
blank         | 
text          | written on the page, but it also injected further ambiguity into a confusing situation. For
blank         | 
text          | example, one of the definitions described “a water bird with a broad bill” and the app
blank         | 
text          | translated the word “bill” as proyecto de ley (or bill of legislation). Rather than providing
blank         | 
text          | support, this error intensified the confusion for Lorena as she tried to get a sense for what
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
              |

text          | the homework instructions were asking. Furthermore, both Lorena and Naomi had
blank         | 
text          | difficulty understanding the phrase “part of speech,” which was key for comprehending
blank         | 
text          | one of the “duck”-related questions that required students to identify whether different
blank         | 
text          | definitions of “duck” were nouns or verbs. In this instance, Lorena finally decided to
blank         | 
text          | wait for Naomi’s father Eduardo to try and further understand the exercise.
blank         | 
text          |        Sometimes, as Érica alluded to in the initial example, understanding the language
blank         | 
text          | of the homework exercise was not enough to equip parents to guide children through a
blank         | 
text          | task. During yet a third visit, Lorena was again engaged in helping Naomi with
blank         | 
text          | mathematics homework that included word problems in English. In this instance, the
blank         | 
text          | various levels of understanding that were necessary to understand the problems became
blank         | 
text          | evident. First, Naomi read the problem aloud, pronouncing each word in the sentence
blank         | 
text          | fluidly and accurately: Sara is 4 feet 5 inches tall. When she stands on the 6-inch step,
blank         | 
text          | how tall is she? Lorena was conscious of the fact that, although Naomi may read the
blank         | 
text          | sentence correctly, she may not have understood the meaning fully. “¿Entiendes todo lo
blank         | 
text          | que dice?,” she asks Naomi (Do you understand everything it says?). “Si no entiendes
blank         | 
text          | algo, tienes que buscarlo. Por eso esta esto” [indicating the iPad]. (If you don’t
blank         | 
text          | understand something, you have to look it up. That’s what this is for). Rather than
blank         | 
text          | initially typing the English question in and eliciting the meaning from the app herself,
blank         | 
text          | Lorena again encouraged Naomi to support herself in the homework task by using the
blank         | 
text          | translator app as a means to understand the problem on her own.
blank         | 
text          |        Using the translator requires an understanding of how the app works; this includes
blank         | 
text          | knowing how to provide the proper context in order to translate the meaning of a phrase
blank         | 
text          | or sentence rather than individual words. Naomi had difficulty at first. When she tried to

              | 
              |

              | 	  
text          | translate the word “stands,” the app
blank         | 
text          | provided equivalents that did not fit the
blank         | 
text          | context of the word problem, including
blank         | 
text          | “suporte,” which corresponds more to the
blank         | 
text          | noun “stand” (as in a music stand or a plant
blank         | 
text          | stand) rather than the verb. When Naomi
blank         | 
text          | did enter in more of the problem to remedy
blank         | 
text          | this, she entered only a part: “stands on a 6           Figure 4c. Naomi’s math assignment worksheet,
              |                                                         with the “inches” problem (problem number 3).
              | inch step, how tall is she?” This of course
blank         | 
text          | also elicited a strange response from the translator because her query did not include the
blank         | 
text          | subject of the sentence and instead just the part that Naomi was attempting to understand.
blank         | 
text          | At this point, although Lorena was aiming to guide Naomi to accomplish the task herself,
blank         | 
text          | Lorena took on a more active role, employing her more nuanced understanding of how
blank         | 
text          | the translator worked. She instructed Naomi to enter the complete question including the
blank         | 
text          | words “When she stands” at the beginning, rather than only part of the question. At this
blank         | 
text          | point, the app provided a correct translation such that both mother and daughter
blank         | 
text          | understood the question and began to work on the mathematical operation.
blank         | 
text          |        Here, another level of understanding came into play due to the nature of the word
blank         | 
text          | problem: familiarity with the imperial measurement system. The problem required
blank         | 
text          | adding 4 feet 5 inches plus 6 inches. After some time studying the problem and trying
blank         | 
text          | out different answers, Naomi did come up with the correct answer of 4 feet, 11 inches.
blank         | 
text          | However, Lorena identified the answer as incorrect. It is not clear exactly what her
blank         | 
text          | thought process might have been or what answer she believed was correct. A likely

              |

blank         | 	  
              | 	  
text          | hypothesis is that because Mexico, along with most other nations, uses the metric system
blank         | 
text          | and Lorena intuitively employed a base-ten system to calculate. By this logic she may
blank         | 
text          | have expected the response to be 5 feet, 1 inch (using the model of 10 inches to a foot as
blank         | 
text          | one would with millimeters to centimeters). Whether this was indeed the case or not, it
blank         | 
text          | illustrates the point that bridging the linguistic divides to understanding children’s
blank         | 
text          | homework can only take families so far. Other aspects of the homework task may be
blank         | 
text          | difficult for parents, either due to their own educational experiences, unfamiliarity with
blank         |

text          |                These examples of using translator apps to make sense of children’s
blank         | 
text          | homework highlight an important way that media facilitated “bridging” home and school.
blank         | 
text          | As seen in the examples above, Lorena used the translator app in a strategic way, using
blank         | 
text          | her critical understanding of how the technology works to make the best possible use of
blank         | 
text          | the translations it provided. In this practice she also explicitly modeled translator use and
blank         | 
text          | emphasized for Naomi that this tool was available and should be used, rather than
blank         | 
text          | approach an exercise without understanding it fully. Naomi contributed to the task using
blank         | 
text          | her own knowledge of English, which Lorena tested by having her translate items aloud
blank         | 
text          | and then supplemented with the translator. Lorena brought her content knowledge as
blank         | 
text          | well as savviness with the technology itself. In this way, the translator app elicited a
blank         | 
text          | collaborative meaning-making practice between mother and child that not only supported
blank         | 
text          | Naomi in completing her homework assignments but also supported Lorena in
blank         | 
text          | developing a deeper understanding of her daughter’s current schoolwork.

text          |             Finally, the translator app empowered the mothers to support their children in
blank         | 
text          | completing her homework, whereas they may otherwise have needed to seek help from
blank         | 
text          | someone else. In the Aguirre family, the children’s father Eduardo Sr. was the go-to
blank         | 
text          | reference for help with English and if Lorena could not adequately understand the
blank         | 
text          | homework Naomi would turn to him. Thus while the translator app played a role in
blank         | 
text          | helping Naomi succeed in correctly answering her math problems, it also helped Lorena
blank         | 
text          | succeed in aiding her daughter herself, rather than having to defer to her husband when
blank         | 
text          | he returned from work in the evening.

blank         | 
text          |             Internet technologies helped support school assignments, and also facilitated
blank         | 
text          | other ways of connecting language heard in school and opportunities to further explore
blank         | 
text          | this language at home. For six-year-old Brandon Orozco, input from peers at school was
blank         | 
text          | often the basis for using Google translate at home. Brandon and his father José Rubén
blank         | 
text          | enjoyed exploring words together several times a week, according to parent interview
blank         | 
text          | reports. The idea to use Google Translate came from Brandon’s speech pathologist, who
blank         | 
text          | recommended it as a means of practicing words at home. Brandon or his father would
blank         | 
text          | speak a word into the app, and the translator displayed both the original word and its
blank         | 
text          | English translation(s), or a selection of possible alternatives if it had not identified the
blank         | 
text          | word. Next to each word, the speaker icon offers the option of speaking the word back
blank         | 
text          | (in either language). Sometimes the pair also explored words in other languages,
blank         | 
text          | translating from Spanish into French, for example. As José Ruben described it:

              | Papi como se dice…? eh, por ejemplo, una                called?” “Dad, how do you say…?” for

text          | – José Ruben, mini-ABI interview
blank         | 
              | 
text          | In this way, the translator app became a familiar reference tool for Brandon and his father.
blank         | 
text          | Particularly, the voice recognition and “speak” feature allowed Brandon to speak English
blank         | 
text          | words he had heard (but might not know how to write), as well as hear the translator
blank         | 
text          | model the pronunciation. In this way, José Rubén and Brandon took up the translator app,
blank         | 
text          | which offers the opportunity to explore vocabulary in a multi-modal manner (text, audio,
blank         | 
text          | speech, etc.) in lieu of a dictionary or other print word reference resource. Unlike large
blank         | 
text          | print dictionaries, the app was also portable and could be taken along and used in any
blank         | 
text          | setting for – to use the popular phrase – “anytime, anywhere learning.”
blank         | 
              | 
text          |              At the same time, apps like Google Translate are not necessarily subjected to
blank         | 
text          | the same kinds of editorial or academic review as published print dictionaries, and it is
blank         | 
text          | unclear how complete or accurate its output might be. In addition, the audio feature,
blank         | 
text          | while useful, does not necessarily represent different dialects of English or Spanish. For
blank         | 
text          | example, in a mini-ABI interview Brandon modeled how he input words into Google
blank         | 
text          | translate, using the Spanish word piyama (pajamas). However, Google translate did not
blank         | 
text          | recognize the Latin American term and suggested the correction of pijama, invalidating

blank         | 
text          | said the word correctly. This last anecdote raises the question of how translator apps
blank         | 
text          | might reflect the various regional forms of Spanish (or other languages) and if they are to
blank         | 
text          | be used as reference tools, how they might more inclusively reflect the particularities in
blank         | 
text          | vocabulary and pronunciation across the very diverse Spanish-speaking world.

blank         | 
text          | different purposes – families used other specific Internet resources to support their
blank         | 
text          | children’s learning and progress in school. In some cases these tools were recommended
blank         | 
text          | and/or subscribed to by the child’s school. In others, parents took the initiative
blank         | 
text          | themselves to find resources that would support their children in a given area. Emergent

text          |        As discussed in Chapter One, research findings comparing children’s learning from
blank         | 
text          | ebooks and traditional books has returned mixed results but more often has shown that
blank         | 
text          | children may learn less in certain areas or engage in fewer productive parent-child
blank         | 
text          | interactions when using ebooks as opposed to print books (e.g. Chiong, Ree & Takeuchi,
blank         | 
text          | 2012; Parish-Morris, Mahajan, Hirsh-Pasek & Michnick Golinkoff, 2013). However,
blank         | 
text          | some research with second language learners has suggested a difference in how electronic
blank         | 
text          | books support these learners, and that these learners may benefit from the multimedia
blank         | 
text          | aspects of ebooks in ways that native speakers do not (Bus, Verhallen & De Jong, 2009).
blank         | 
text          | The example shared below highlights two particular phenomena. First, the opportunity to
blank         | 
text          | design electronic literacy materials tailored to English learners who are also developing
blank         | 
text          | readers. Second, Saúl’s mother Érica steered the interaction toward rote practice rather
blank         | 
text          | than interest-driven exploration and learning, echoing earlier research suggesting that
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino immigrant parents may use a cultural model of literacy focused on
blank         | 
text          | repetition (Reese & Gallimore, 2000; Goldenberg, Reese & Gallimore, 1992). Despite
blank         | 
text          | her very strong motivation and concern for furthering her child’s learning, Érica’s own
blank         | 
text          | vision of what constitutes effective language and literacy activities may not have had the
blank         | 
text          | desired effects.
blank         | 
text          |        Prior to the iPad intervention in this study, six of the seven families did not report
blank         | 
text          | using any form of ebooks or electronic reading technologies with their children. None of
blank         | 
text          | the families had e-readers. Parents all reported in interviews and on the Families and
blank         | 
text          | Media survey that they did read print books regularly with their children. In many cases
blank         | 
text          | the children’s schools had a consistent practice of sending home weekly book bundles for

blank         | 
text          | also reported that they made use of local libraries to find (print) books for their children.
blank         | 
text          |        Saúl Martínez Jr., eight years old and preparing to start third grade at the time,
blank         | 
text          | was the one child that, according to parent report, occasionally used ebooks. Saúl
blank         | 
text          | accessed these ebooks via MyOn.com, an online ebook library that his elementary school
blank         | 
text          | subscribed to. According to Saúl’s mother Érica, Saúl’s third grade teacher
blank         | 
text          | recommended that children use MyOn.com to practice reading over the summer. I could
blank         | 
text          | not determine whether all parents received the website information or how, but Érica,
blank         | 
text          | who was a stay-at-home mom at the time and was involved at the children’s school, had
blank         | 
text          | acquired the login information from the teacher. Érica brought it with her when she took
blank         | 
text          | her sons to the local library, which was the only place where the family accessed
blank         | 
text          | computers outside of school at the time.
blank         | 
text          |        The Martínez family lived in tight quarters sharing just one room among the four
blank         | 
text          | family members in an apartment that was shared with another family and some single
blank         | 
text          | tenants (see details in Chapter Three). In addition, father Saúl Sr. worked nights and was
blank         | 
text          | usually at home sleeping during the day. Often when the children were not in school –
blank         | 
text          | and particularly during the summer on days when the children didn’t attend their summer
blank         | 
text          | program – Érica sought to take the children out during the day, to keep them entertained
blank         | 
text          | and to give their father a chance to rest. Options for outings were limited because the
blank         | 
text          | family did not have a car and Érica (who had only arrived in the country about six

blank         | 
text          |            Saúl Jr. and David began their typical routine upon arriving at the library by
blank         | 
text          | going directly to the library computers, where users sign in with their individual library
blank         | 
text          | card numbers and each cardholder is allowed a session of one hour maximum. During
blank         | 
text          | this time, the boys usually accessed the web sites of children’s television channels such
blank         | 
text          | as the Cartoon Network or Disney XD and played the online games available there.
blank         | 
text          | During these times, Érica supported the boys if they needed help, but otherwise she sat at
blank         | 
text          | a table nearby and browsed social media or watched videos on her smartphone.
blank         | 
text          | Occasionally Érica had logged Saúl Jr. in to MyOn.com using the information his teacher
blank         | 
text          | at school had provided, and helped guide him through the selection of ebooks.
blank         | 
text          |        During one visit that occurred at the library, Érica logged Saúl Jr. in to the site.
blank         | 
text          | Saúl himself seemed willing, though unenthusiastic about the activity. Given his own
blank         | 
text          | choice, he would have preferred to play online games for the full hour. Érica explained
blank         | 
text          | that Saúl found it unfair when his brother David was allowed to continue playing while
blank         | 
text          | Saúl had to “study.” This perspective reveals how the ebook activity, which a teacher
blank         | 
text          | prescribed and his mother initiated, was something Saúl viewed as a form of obligatory
blank         | 
text          | “studying” – clearly different from entertaining himself or having fun. The nature of this
blank         | 
text          | e-reading activity that Saúl and his mother framed as a form of academic support,
blank         | 
text          | differentiated it from the boys’ leisure time activities at the library including playing
blank         | 
text          | video games and perusing the print book selection there, which Érica allowed the boys to

blank         | 
text          | appeared to be one of the first times, if not the first time, Saúl was accessing the site

text          | outside of school, as he was not immediately sure what to do and asked for direction.

text          | The transcript below captures the interaction:
blank         | 
text          | Initially, Saúl appears somewhat hesitant about what he should choose to read from the site’s
              | menu of ebooks.

              | The site is structured such that on each menu page, topics are listed with large picture icons
              | above each. Saúl chooses “Science” from a list of topics and then “Earth Sciences.” A series
              | of images with corresponding book titles pops up.

              | cada palabra.
              | (The idea is for him to pronounce the words in English. Because since he doesn’t know…
              | it’s for learning English. So on there they read aloud and he has to memorize how to say
              | each word.)
              | Saúl listens and watches the screen while the narration of the fossil book is read to him and
              | the words are highlighted on the screen.
              | E: Pero siento que es mucho para él… (But I feel that it’s is a lot for him).
              | Meanwhile Saúl clicks and follows for the first page or so (listening to the narration on
              | headphones provided along with the library computer).
              | Shortly after he began “reading” the book, Saúl closes it and begins searching for another
              | title.
              | The “Favorite Characters” collection, marked by a cartoon icon, catches his eye. He clicks
              | and sees the series of books and their images.
              | S: Batman! (excitedly).
              | Saúl chooses a book entiteld “Dark Knight: Cat Commander.” When the book opens, it is
              | not like the colorful cover illustration that attracted Saúl to the book. The chapter title is

text          |           In Saúl’s experience navigating the site, some conflicts arose in trying to locate
blank         | 
text          | content that was 1). engaging for Saúl in terms based on the topic; 2). within Saúl’s zone
blank         | 
text          | of proximal development for English reading and comprehension (with only six months’
blank         | 
text          | experience learning English); and 3). fitting with Érica’s vision of what a language-
blank         | 
text          | learning or reading activity for her son should look like. It is difficult to determine
blank         | 
text          | whether recommendations from Saúl’s teacher may have influenced in Érica’s approach
blank         | 
text          | to directing the activity with her son. What the example does support is the notion,
blank         | 
text          | described as part of Dugan, Stevens and Mehus’ (2010) concept of “in-show, in-room, in-
blank         | 
text          | world,” that a child’s engagement with technology is shaped not only by the program
blank         | 
text          | itself, but also by the ways that parents or other people in the room guide or interact with
blank         | 
text          | him or her. Similarly, it illustrates the sociocultural or sociointeractionist perspective of
blank         | 
text          | second language acquisition that emphasizes the influence of the social context
blank         | 
text          | surrounding the learner.
blank         | 
text          |        In this example, Saúl tries out reading books from three different categories – the
blank         | 
text          | Science collection, where he chooses the “Fossils” book, the Favorite Characters
blank         | 
text          | collection where he chooses the “Dark Knight” book, and the Picturebooks collection

              | 	  
text          | where he chooses “Crabby Pants.” In exploring different reading materials, Saúl had
blank         | 
text          | some difficulty finding a good match between his interests (particularly in the Favorite
blank         | 
text          | Characters/superhero genre as illustrated by his enthusiasm for the Dark Knight text) and
blank         | 
text          | his zone of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1986) in terms of English reading and
blank         | 
text          | comprehension. In this “mismatch” that occurred between Saúl’s interests and the level
blank         | 
text          | of the text, the MyOn books aimed at his age group assumed a level of both English and
blank         | 
text          | reading skills that were far from Saúl’s zone of proximal development as a beginning
blank         | 
text          | English learner. For this reason Saúl may indeed have had a difficult time accessing
blank         | 
text          | meaning from the texts he chose and become discouraged with the books. The vocabulary
blank         | 
text          | in the text (shown in Figure 4g, above) is fairly advanced, and although Saúl
blank         | 
text          | demonstrated an interest in the theme of the story and was attracted by the cover
blank         | 
text          | illustration, the language used in the book and lack of illustrations to contextualize them
blank         | 
text          | likely made it very challenging for him to grasp at the content of the story. On the other
blank         | 
text          | extreme, books with simpler text and a plentiful visual support were targeted at
blank         | 
text          | preschoolers and the kinds of topics that children of that age might prefer. Although Saúl
blank         | 
text          | perhaps had a better chance of understanding the story, the aspects that had grabbed his
blank         | 
text          | interest in the first two titles were missing there.
blank         | 
text          |        A second challenge was Érica’s fairly constant instruction throughout the activity.
blank         | 
text          | Intent on deepening and ensuring the learning value of this activity for her son, Érica was
blank         | 
text          | focused on guiding him to repeat along with the narrator. However, this intervention
blank         | 
text          | appeared to further hamper Saúl’s comprehension of the text. While the vocabulary in
blank         | 
text          | the Dark Knight book was difficult, attempting to repeat unfamiliar words and match the
blank         | 
text          | pace of the narrator (as well as understand the text) was more so. As Érica explained, she

blank         | 
text          | reading to understand the text or story at hand. This perspective – whether stemming
blank         | 
text          | from the teacher’s instruction or Érica’s own interpretation of it – placed more value
blank         | 
text          | repeating words than on establishing an interest-based, sustained engagement with the
blank         | 
text          | text and endeavoring to access meaning. Although it is not clear how much Saúl’s teacher
blank         | 
text          | influenced Érica, her approach to reading activities in these settings is reminiscent of
blank         | 
text          | other research showing how immigrant parents’ own schooling experiences in their home

blank         | 
text          | that Saúl would not be successful with these more advanced books. She expressed that
blank         | 
text          | the reading was “mucho para él” (“a lot for him”), suggesting that Saúl needed to find a
blank         | 
text          | book that was simpler and less text-heavy. One might argue that Érica identified material
blank         | 
text          | such as the Dark Knight book as beyond Saúl’s capability, perhaps also considering that
blank         | 
text          | her own ability to support him with English texts was limited. This perspective was

text          | consistent with my observations of Érica when she guided her children to choose print
blank         | 
text          | books as well. If the boys chose longer books with more text on each page, Érica often
blank         | 
text          | discouraged those choices and suggested they exchange them for shorter books with more
blank         | 
text          | illustrations, explaining that the boys didn't finish the books if they were longer and
blank         | 
text          | denser. Érica’s perspective, which she applied across print and electronic literacy
blank         | 
text          | activities, sheds light on her own framework for thinking about literacy and her definition
blank         | 
text          | of a fruitful reading activity for her child. For Érica it was important for Saúl to be able
blank         | 
text          | to decode (and with MyOn.com, simultaneously repeat) the text he was presented with.
blank         | 
text          | She may also have been concerned about her son’s feelings or confidence if he found
blank         | 
text          | himself unable to follow a story. It is difficult to know whether Érica had constructed
blank         | 
text          | this vision because she observed Saúl quickly losing interest in the denser, less visual
blank         | 
text          | texts or whether Saúl’s own engagement was shaped by his mother’s guidance in
blank         | 
text          | everyday reading activities – perhaps a combination of the two. In this instance, Érica’s
blank         | 
text          | assessment that the Dark Knight book was beyond Saúl’s reading ability may well have
blank         | 
text          | been correct. Although the present study does not include language assessments, there
blank         | 
text          | were comprehension questions at the end of the MyOn.com books that allow for some
blank         | 
text          | speculation. Saúl had difficulty answering the comprehension questions that were
blank         | 
text          | presented to him on MyOn about the Crabby Pants picturebook, which was far simpler
blank         | 
text          | and fully illustrated. It stands to reason that he may have understood very little of the text
blank         | 
text          | of the Dark Knight had he attempted to continue with it. However, his mother’s
blank         | 
text          | intervention made it challenging to even attempt.
blank         | 
text          |        This example, which shows a unique way that technology can span in-school and
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | less frequently represented in the literature. The first is to investigate the opportunities to
blank         | 
text          | leverage technology to create customized ebooks that can take into account both
blank         | 
text          | children’s age and potential interest as well as language skills, rather than automatically
blank         | 
text          | linking these two aspects in design. For example, one could imagine a Dark Knight book
blank         | 
text          | that used simpler vocabulary and employed illustrations to help readers contextualize the
blank         | 
text          | story. Such a book would have the potential to capture the interest of a child Saúl’s age,
blank         | 
text          | but also fall within his individual zone of proximal development in the given scenario.
blank         | 
text          | Although MyOn.com offers a wide variety of books integrated with assessments and a
blank         | 
text          | multitude of ways to customize the selection made available, the books themselves do not
blank         | 
text          | offer multiple options for difficulty. In other words, books targeted at a given age range
blank         | 
text          | are written at a particular level. This linking of age and reading level may work to some
blank         | 
text          | extent among native or highly proficient English speakers, but other combinations of text
blank         | 
text          | difficulty and interest area could be possible given technology tools available today, and
blank         | 
text          | for English learners these multiple combinations may more closely tailor content for
blank         | 
text          | meaningful literacy experiences.
blank         | 
text          |        Second, this example draws specific attention to the role of guided participation in
blank         | 
text          | Saúl’s activities (Rogoff, 1990) in this case, and the ways in which Érica’s own framing
blank         | 
text          | of the literacy activity impacted Saúl’s experience. As Goldenberg, Reese and Gallimore
blank         | 
text          | point out, “Just as a teacher might design and send materials and activities to children's
blank         | 
text          | homes, so too does the child's home receive and interpret them.” Érica placed a very high
blank         | 
text          | value on her son’s education and was motivated to support him, much as are other
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino parents documented in prior research (Valdés, 1983; Reese & Gallimore,
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | his English skills is strong and led her to intentionally seek out an out-of-school literacy
blank         | 
text          | tool prescribed by Saúl’s teacher. The difficulty arose not in motivating Érica to engage
blank         | 
text          | in the task with Saúl or even providing a useful tool, but instead in Erica’s (and perhaps
blank         | 
text          | Saúl’s teacher’s) framing the activity as a way to repeat words rather than as a means of
blank         | 
text          | accessing texts of interest and allowing her son to attempt to access meaning.

text          | Media as a resource for exploring a school-sparked interest
blank         | 
text          |             As shown in prior ethnographic research, families may use media – and
blank         | 
text          | specifically YouTube – to further explore topics of child interest (Barron, Levinson,
blank         | 
text          | Matthews & Vea, in preparation). During the present study, a case example from six-
blank         | 
text          | year-old Brandon Orozco and his father José Rubén illustrated the way that media
blank         | 
text          | facilitated parent-child exploration of a theme the child became interested in at school –
blank         | 
text          | in this case history and historical figures.
blank         | 
text          |             Internet resources provided the means for families to access the types of
blank         | 
text          | information included in school curricula, but also allowed families to explore beyond,
blank         | 
text          | expanding upon interests that were ignited in school or elsewhere. Although this theme
blank         | 
text          | emerged even more prominently in relationship to ebook use on the iPads (discussed in
blank         | 
text          | Chapter Seven), some families were already using Internet tools in this way before
blank         | 
text          | receiving their iPads. In the following case, YouTube provided the means for a father and
blank         | 
text          | son to further explore an interest that was sparked at school.
blank         | 
text          |             Six-year-old Brandon Orozco had a keen interest in people in history, and

blank         | 
text          | to know about in the moment. A curious and inquisitive child, he often asked questions
blank         | 
text          | about famous people that had been presented in school, either because of a particular
blank         | 
text          | holiday such as Martin Luther King Jr. Day or other thematic units his first grade class
blank         | 
text          | was studying at the time. Although Brandon’s father José Rubén was one of the more
blank         | 
text          | educated parents in the study, having completed three semesters of college in El Salvador,
blank         | 
text          | he did not have many of the answers that Brandon sought and the two turned to YouTube
blank         | 
text          | as a way of learning more. As José Rubén explained:
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Entonces, ya, para que él vaya… porque él nos         So, well, for him to… because he also asks us a

              | Martin Luther King, de Washington, de todos…          King, Washington, about all of them… because I
              | porque me imagino que en la escuela se los            imagine that at school they mention them and he
              | mencionan y él viene con la idea de eso o quiere      comes home with that idea or wants to see what

              | Martin Luther King hablando, y está ya con una        Luther King is talking, and that way gets an idea
              | idea de quién es, ya se percata de quién es la        of who he is, and he starts realizing who the
              | persona, quiénes son…                                 person is, who they are.

text          | Although numerous text resources are available online about any of these

text          | important names in history, in José Rubén view videos provided a way of
blank         | 
text          | representing information that was easier for Brandon to connect to at his age.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Porque es más fácil para él, para que él lo        Because it’s easier for him, for him to visualize

              | como uno de adulto, pues lo pongo a leer y todo    as adults sometimes we read and understand
              | y a veces entendemos más bien. Pero a veces si     things better. But sometimes if we’re given

blank         | 
text          | researched animals and dinosaur species. José Rubén also described one case in
blank         | 
text          | which Brandon’s questions were actually sparked by watching media – one of
blank         | 
text          | the Disney Ice Age movies. “Dice ‘Papi, ¿en esa época cómo era, que no había
blank         | 
text          | buses, no había…?’ entonces vemos documentales donde aparecen y todo.” (“He
blank         | 
text          | said ‘Dad, at that time what was it like, there weren’t any buses, there weren’t...?,’
blank         | 
text          | so we watched documentaries where it’s shown and everything.”). In this way,
blank         | 
text          | media and particularly Internet video became a go-to resource for Brandon and
blank         | 
text          | José Rubén to learn about topics Brandon was interested in, taking advantage of
blank         | 
text          | both the information available as well as the visual nature of the material and in
blank         | 
text          | the case of historical figures, even seeing and hearing people from the past.

              | 
              | 
text          |        This section has presented several language and literacy experiences that media
blank         | 
text          | facilitated for families, specifically activities in which media helped “bridge” home and
blank         | 
text          | school settings. In the homework-related examples, Internet translating tools mediated
blank         | 
text          | families’ understanding of assignments, bringing some challenges but also allowing
blank         | 
text          | families to collaboratively access meaning in ways they may not have been able to do
blank         | 
text          | otherwise. Oral and visual explanations available online were a tool to support parents
blank         | 
text          | content knowledge, as in Rebeca’s example of using YouTube videos to better
blank         | 
text          | understand how to help her daughter with math homework. Online video also provided a
blank         |

text          | participation powerfully mediate the experience.
blank         | 
text          |          Moreover these examples show how deeply motivated parents in these case
blank         | 
text          | families are to support their children’s schooling and learning. As I discuss further in
blank         | 
text          | Chapter Eight, the data presented here offer counter-examples to “deficit” models that
blank         | 
text          | approach low-income, non-dominant groups as “culturally deprived” (Reissman, 1962).
blank         | 
text          | Parents in this sample were not indifferent or nonchalant about their children’s education
blank         | 
text          | – on the contrary. They actively supported their children’s efforts, modeled ways of
blank         | 
text          | leveraging media tools for their own knowledge and sought out ways to understand and
blank         | 
text          | expand upon what children were learning in school.

text          | formally employed faced challenges in their efforts to study and learn English through

text          | community classes. In these cases, some parents leveraged translator apps as a bridge
blank         |

text          | Translate when he was faced with the task of writing a letter to his boss to request a raise.
blank         |

text          | estimates to clients, answering questions and so forth. Érica Martínez, who at the time

text          | In the excerpt, Érica expresses lack of confidence in her ability to communicate in
blank         | 
text          | English on the phone. Although the online job posts combined with the translator allowed
blank         | 
text          | her to read jobs posts and understand them, they were not able to support her when it
blank         | 
text          | came to calling strangers to inquire. Due in part to her hesitance to call potential
blank         | 
text          | employers, Érica did not apply for any opportunities that she found online, and this
blank         | 
text          | limited the scope of potential jobs she might have considered. Eventually, when a
blank         | 
text          | personal acquaintance connected Érica with a job at a convenience store, nearly an hour

blank         | 
text          |             The anxiety Érica expressed (above) about communicating in English was
blank         | 
text          | echoed by other mothers as well. Natalia Acosta, wife of Miguel, was among the parents

blank         | 
text          | English classes daily, one at a local community center and another at a church. She was
blank         | 
text          | motivated to improve her English, which she considered very basic, after several years
blank         | 
text          | shying away from studying the language. Natalia had felt discouraged from studying
blank         | 
text          | English during her early experiences in this country, and her confidence was shaken. In a
blank         | 
text          | tearful moment in an interview, Natalia shared how she first enrolled in English classes,
blank         | 
text          | soon after arriving in the US:

text          |                                                        Natalia: […] I didn’t know… I only knew

text          | The way the teacher treated her and the other students made Natalia feel humiliated and
blank         | 
text          | demoralized. It took her many years and getting to know different programs in the city
blank         | 
text          | before she had the courage and motivation to study again. In particular, the prospect of
blank         | 
text          | her elder daughter Amanda bringing home more schoolwork in English in the coming
blank         | 
text          | years was a strong motivator for Natalia. Through her studies, she hoped to develop the
blank         | 
text          | skills she would need to support her daughters in their schooling.
blank         | 
text          |        In Natalia’s case, Google Translate enabled her to comprehend and attempt difficult
blank         | 
text          | tasks in English that she may have otherwise been discouraged by. For example,
blank         | 
text          | Natalia’s English teacher asked her to write a letter explaining why she would not be in
blank         | 
text          | class next week. Natalia wrote her letter in Spanish, entered it into the translator, which

blank         | 
text          | translation was a more approachable task than writing a letter in English from scratch.

              | 
              | 
text          |              Natalia had a critical eye for what the translator produced and did not trust its
blank         | 
text          | precision implicitly. She was familiar with the ways in which the translator could
blank         | 
text          | sometimes confuse or mistranslate words. She read through the English letter carefully,
blank         | 
text          | and detected that the app had translated “papa” (which she had meant as “papá”) as “pope”
blank         | 
text          | instead of father. She corrected the error, writing “father” in the place of “pope.” The
blank         | 
text          | letter contained some errors but was overall quite clear. However, it was not apparent
blank         | 
text          | how much writing the letter had served Natalia as a learning exercise. On one hand, she
blank         | 
text          | may not have felt confident enough to tackle the task of drafting a letter in English from
blank         | 
text          | scratch, and the translator may have provided the support she needed to attempt it. She
blank         | 
text          | also was able to get a (mostly) correct English version of the letter she had written in
blank         | 
text          | Spanish, and compare the two. On the other hand she was not required to engage in
blank         | 
text          | writing, structuring her own sentences or translating words herself from Spanish into
blank         | 
text          | English.

text          |        While the translator played a supportive role in some aspects, one might also question
blank         | 
text          | whether Natalia’s continued reliance on it might become limiting from a learning
blank         | 
text          | perspective. In this light, her use of the translator could be seen as a crutch that she
blank         | 
text          | depended on and which prevented her from engaging in deeper or sustained learning. For
blank         | 
text          | example, Natalia often used the translator to complete her homework assignments for
blank         | 
text          | English class, and one exercise asked students to create a sentence with the verb “to see.”
blank         | 
text          | Rather than attempting to write a sentence on her own using “see,” Natalia formed a
blank         | 
text          | sentence in Spanish with the word “ver” in the infinitive (“quiero ir a ver una película al
blank         | 
text          | cine”) which she entered into the translator and then copied the translation (“I want to go
blank         | 
text          | see a movie at the cinema) onto her homework sheet. In this case, forming a simple
blank         | 
text          | sentence with “see” seemed feasible given Natalia’s knowledge of English, but Natalia
blank         | 
text          | appeared more comfortable constructing sentences in Spanish (thus using the full range
blank         | 
text          | of her vocabulary) rather than constructing a perhaps simpler sentence in English and,
blank         | 
text          | moreover, risking making a mistake. This raises several questions regarding Natalia’s
blank         | 
text          | experience with English instruction, including the types of
blank         | 
text          | assignments and corresponding strategies that could have
blank         | 
text          | supported her in practicing English more independently
blank         | 
text          | despite the fears and anxieties that she faced.
blank         | 
text          |               In addition to cases that involved translator
blank         | 
text          | apps, Érica Martínez used the Wlingua app on her android
blank         | 
text          | smartphone as a strategy to improve her English. Wlingua
blank         | 
text          | provides a selection of free English language lessons and
              |                                                                   Figure 4k. Screenshot from

text          | addition to using the app on her own, Érica also reported that six-year-old David
blank         | 
text          | sometimes used the app along with her, the two of them working through the English
blank         | 
text          | language exercises together. This was the only case in the study of a parent using a
blank         | 
text          | language-learning smartphone app (other than translator apps) that was documented prior
blank         | 
text          | to distributing the iPads. Notably however, Lorena Aguirre engaged in an “analog”
blank         | 
text          | version of this activity, using an English language workbook that had been discarded by
blank         | 
text          | the children’s school to do English exercises at home together with her six-year-old son
blank         | 
text          | Eduardo.
blank         | 
text          |            Parents overall expressed interest in ways that they could improve their
blank         | 
text          | English using technology – tools that they could use at home and on their own schedule.
blank         | 
text          | Miguel Acosta described how after Natalia’s discouraging experiences with in-person
blank         | 
text          | English classes, they had bought a series of videos for her to learn from, although she did
blank         | 
text          | not use them for very long. The language-learning software Rosetta Stone also emerged
blank         | 
text          | in interviews as a resource most or all parents were familiar with; two parents had used
blank         | 
text          | the software and one mother hoped to acquire it for her own use. Karina Parra and
blank         | 
text          | Lorena Aguirre, whose children attended both attended the same elementary school, had
blank         | 
text          | used Rosetta Stone in a computer-based English course that had been offered for parents
blank         | 
text          | at the school. Rebeca Rivera, who did not have access to language classes at either of her
blank         | 
text          | daughters’ schools, was interested in using Rosetta Stone and was in the process of
blank         | 
text          | collecting different components of a desktop computer (a comadre had handed down a
blank         | 
text          | computer tower, but she still needed a monitor and keyboard). Rebeca’s express purpose
blank         | 
text          | in getting the computer was in order to install Rosetta Stone and use both its computer-
blank         | 
text          | based and mobile programs to improve her English.

text          |            Érica Martínez, quoted earlier describing her anxiety about speaking with
blank         | 
text          | potential employers, was one of the mothers in the study who was actively engaged in
blank         | 
text          | learning English. She enrolled in a course at a local community college and was
blank         | 
text          | attending regularly for a portion of the study, prior to getting a job at a convenience store
blank         | 
text          | and interrupting her studies. During her time in the class, Érica used YouTube to find
blank         | 
text          | additional support for English pronunciation, which she saw as her biggest challenge.
blank         | 
text          | Around eight o’clock, her family was asleep, Saúl Sr. getting some extra rest before his
blank         | 
text          | all-night shift. Érica found that rather than going to sleep with them, she preferred to stay
blank         | 
text          | up until around 11 pm when Saúl got up to go to work, as inevitably he disturbed her
blank         | 
text          | while he was getting ready to go. Thus, between the children’s bedtime at 8 pm and
blank         | 
text          | Saúl’s wake time to go to work at 11 pm, Érica found three hours of quiet when she

text          | would put on her headphones and use the iPad (furnished by the study) to watch videos.
blank         | 
text          | The videos she reported watching most were from two series: one by a Mexican pastor

text          | entitled “EnSimplesPalabras,” created for Spanish speakers which Érica found by

text          |          The YouTube video emphasized language learning as a function of memorizing
blank         | 
text          | and repeating word groups, much like the strategy Érica had emphasized with Saúl Jr.
blank         | 
text          | three months earlier, when using MyOn.com. Érica used the pronunciation videos on the
blank         | 
text          | iPad I provided, whereas the MyOn.com session was prior to the iPad intervention. The
blank         | 
text          | videos present series of individual words based on phonemes and include explanations
blank         | 
text          | that compare the Spanish pronunciation of various letters to the way those letters are
blank         | 
text          | pronounced in English. In a somewhat unusual strategy, the video also models the way
blank         | 
text          | American English speakers would pronounce Spanish words, as a way of emphasizing
blank         | 
text          | the differences in how sounds like “r” or “t” differ between the two languages. Érica
blank         | 
text          | herself, now in the role of learner, recognized that the videos focused perhaps too
blank         | 
text          | exclusively on phonetic pronunciation at the expense of meaning. “Lo único que no me
blank         | 
text          | gusta de aquí es que no dice que significa,” she commented as she showed me the video.
blank         | 
text          | “Te diste cuenta? Solo te pronuncia. Entonces después yo lo entro al traductor y veo lo

text          | que significa.” (“The only thing I don’t like here is that it doesn’t say what things mean.
blank         | 
text          | Did you notice? It just pronounces them. So afterwards I enter it into the translator [app]
blank         | 
text          | and I see what it means.”)
blank         | 
text          |           Having available time was an important factor in enabling Érica to engage in this
blank         | 
text          | kind of self-guided learning with the Internet. A quiet moment in the evening where she
blank         | 
text          | was able to relax with her device and headphones allowed her the opportunity to expand
blank         | 
text          | on her English studies using Internet resources. While she was still a stay-at-home mom,
blank         | 
text          | Érica did not mind waiting up until 11 pm and helping Saúl get ready for work. She also
blank         | 
text          | had time for her English course and other activities during the day when the boys were at
blank         | 
text          | school. At the point when Érica finally found work and began her job at a convenience
blank         | 
text          | store (during the last month of the study) her schedule became hectic and she had little
blank         | 
text          | time or energy to engage in these self-guided learning practices. At this point, Érica
blank         | 
text          | dropped out of her English class and could no longer manage to stay awake after the boys
blank         | 
text          | went to sleep. In this way, having available time both to study English in class and to
blank         | 
text          | make use of online resources was key for this learning practice with media.
blank         | 
text          |         César Rivera also reported seeking out YouTube videos for English study, searching
blank         | 
text          | much as Érica Martínez did for terms such as “clase de inglés” and others. César
blank         | 
text          | described how he used both formal instructional materials and other artifacts for English
blank         | 
text          | study – he searched online for actual English language lessons and also looked up songs
blank         | 
text          | and other non-instructional videos with the express purpose of honing his English skills.
blank         | 
text          |        Although only three parents in the sample used online videos in ways related to
blank         | 
text          | language learning, school or classes, others used video regularly for finding other types
blank         | 
text          | of information, such as recipes and hairstyles. With the content available on YouTube,

text          | III. Patterns of media-supported knowledge seeking strategies across families
blank         | 
text          |        As detailed in the examples above, media played a role in providing access to
blank         | 
text          | information, instruction and academic support via a variety of tools and platforms, both
blank         | 
text          | by facilitating a bridge between home and children’s schools, and by supporting parents
blank         | 
text          | in their studies or careers. Six of the seven families reported using media for these
blank         | 
text          | purposes prior to the iPad intervention, and Table 4a, at the opening of this chapter,
blank         | 
text          | captures this type of media use by family. Sara and Manuel Morales, arguably the most
blank         | 
text          | “tech-wary” parents in the sample, were the only ones who did not report using media in
blank         | 
text          | this category prior to receiving their iPad. The table also highlights translator apps as the
blank         | 
text          | form that was used across most families.
blank         | 
text          |        The study revealed some fairly logical correlations between parents’ employment
blank         | 
text          | status and observed uses of technology particularly for academics (supporting either
blank         | 
text          | adults’ or children’s studies). In terms of parents’ own studies, this trend was largely due
blank         | 
text          | to the general pattern that parents not employed outside the home took classes to further
blank         | 
text          | their own learning, whereas working parents did not. As one might imagine, stay-at-
blank         | 
text          | home parents had more time to pursue their personal academic goals than did parents
blank         | 
text          | who worked long hours at full-time blue collar or service industry jobs. Stay-at-home
blank         | 
text          | parents in this sample, who were also busy, managed to include time for their own study

text          | when children were enrolled in school. For Natalia Acosta, who cared for her two-year-
blank         | 
text          | old daughter Susi during the day, attending English classes was possible because the
blank         | 
text          | organizations offering classes also included a supervised play space for little ones. The
blank         | 
text          | parents who reported consistently attending English classes at any point during the study
blank         | 
text          | were Érica Martínez, Karina Parra, Lorena Aguirre and Natália Acosta – all stay-at-home
blank         | 
text          | mothers. Rebeca Rivera also reported using technology to support her GED studies.
blank         | 
text          | Rebeca, who was a working mom, was able to pursue her studies regularly during times
blank         | 
text          | when she did not have full time work shifts (the off-season at the sports complex where
blank         | 
text          | she worked). Sara Morales and Carmen Orozco were both employed full-time and did
blank         | 
text          | not report participating in any type of adult education. Of the fathers, only César Rivera
blank         | 
text          | was taking English courses, which he attended at a local community college. César was
blank         | 
text          | also the only father who was divorced and did not reside with wife or children. It is
blank         | 
text          | important to note that the workplace – depending on the language(s) used there – was
blank         | 
text          | sometimes an opportunity as well. Érica Martínez, who began working near the end of
blank         | 
text          | data collection, reported that she felt she was learning to communicate in English through
blank         | 
text          | her work as a cashier serving primarily non-Spanish-speaking customers.
blank         | 
text          |        Regarding the use of technology to support children with their homework efforts,
blank         | 
text          | the frequency of such activities and the opportunity to observe them was related to
blank         | 
text          | several factors. First, as mentioned in the relevant section, several of the children were
blank         | 
text          | not yet consistently receiving homework in English, as they were enrolled in kindergarten
blank         | 
text          | or first grade in dual language immersion programs where these early years were taught
blank         | 
text          | mostly in Spanish. Only the two families with third graders (the two oldest children in
blank         | 
text          | the sample) reported consistently receiving homework assigned in English, and they both

              | 
              |

text          | used electronic translators to support their comprehension of assignments. Some parents
blank         | 
text          | of younger children expressed that were looking ahead to the future and trying to prepare
blank         | 
text          | for the time when their children’s schoolwork would be English-based. Both Manuel
blank         | 
text          | Morales, father of six-year-old Estela, and Natalia Acosta, mother of five-year-old
blank         | 
text          | Amanda, described during visits that supporting their children with future schoolwork
blank         | 
text          | was a major motivation to improve their own English skills.
blank         | 
text          |        Another factor was again related to parents’ work status and children’s after-school
blank         | 
text          | enrollment. In five out of the seven families, children were enrolled in after school
blank         | 
text          | programs that often provided homework time, sometimes with support from after school
blank         | 
text          | instructors (Bryanna Parra attended a daily after school program even though her mother
blank         | 
text          | was not employed). After school attendance reduced the amount of time that children
blank         | 
text          | spent working on their homework in the home, and thus the probability that visits would
blank         | 
text          | coincide with homework hours. The family that was observed the most using technology
blank         | 
text          | to support children’s homework completion was the Aguirre family – Lorena was a stay-
blank         | 
text          | at-home mom and the children did not attend a daily after-school program. Homework
blank         | 
text          | was usually completed at home with support from one or both parents, and often this
blank         | 
text          | occurred in the afternoons after school which was also a preferred time for the family to
blank         | 
text          | receive visits.
blank         | 
text          |        As described in the data examples, when children engaged in these strategic forms of
blank         | 
text          | media use for learning they usually had guidance from their parents, however this pattern
blank         | 
text          | does not suggest that these media activities could not be child-led. Multiple studies have
blank         | 
text          | documented intentional media-based learning activities initiated by children that advance
blank         | 
text          | their interest-based practices (Barron, 2006; Ito, Baumer, Bittanti, Boyd, Cody, Herr &

blank         | 
text          | immigrant families (Katz, 2007, 2010; Tripp, 2011; Schwartz & Gutiérrez, 2014),
blank         | 
text          | however these studies focus on older children and adolescents. The children in the
blank         | 
text          | present study were younger (two-and-a-half to nine years old) and among these families,
blank         | 
text          | information seeking online was often led or guided by adults. In this sample, although
blank         | 
text          | adults may have been leading or supporting most of these interactions, children were
blank         | 
text          | involved significantly in many of these instances and in many cases were the motivation
blank         | 
text          | behind the knowledge- or meaning-seeking. Examples of parents using media to further
blank         | 
text          | their learning is also relevant in multiple ways to understanding children’s learning
blank         | 
text          | ecologies and media practices that may be modeled at home.
blank         | 
text          |        In addition, “strategic” or “intentional” uses of media for learning are not necessarily
blank         | 
text          | completely separate from more playful forms explored in the next chapter. To illustrate,
blank         | 
text          | one observation revealed how the use of the translator for homework support sometimes
blank         | 
text          | flowed into a playful activity for the children in one family. During a visit, young
blank         | 
text          | Eduardo and Naomi entertained themselves after finishing their homework, taking
blank         | 
text          | advantage of the fact that the iPad was on the kitchen table in front of them with the
blank         | 
text          | iTranslate app open. Naomi and Eduardo – who reported that they engaged in this
blank         | 
text          | activity from time to time – enjoyed typing words into the translator and selecting a
blank         | 
text          | variety of different languages to hear the translation. Welsh, Italian, Afrikaans and
blank         | 
text          | Chinese were among those they experimented with that day, entering “hola,” “adios,” and
blank         | 
text          | even their names to see what the result would be and repeat along when the app spoke it
blank         | 
text          | back to them.

title         | Chapter Conclusion
blank         | 
text          |        In sum this chapter focuses on the important finding in this study that family media
blank         | 
text          | practices among the seven case families were diverse and included resourceful and
blank         | 
text          | intentional strategies for knowledge seeking using Internet tools. Whether bridging
blank         | 
text          | understanding between home and children’s school settings, or supporting parents in their
blank         | 
text          | own studies or careers, media tools and particularly Internet-based apps (translators,
blank         | 
text          | online video, online libraries, etc.) played important roles in facilitating access to
blank         | 
text          | information, instruction and academic support. Moreover, these supports were products
blank         | 
text          | of the ways in which families took up media tools and harnessed them to advance toward
blank         | 
text          | particular goals. Families varied in their “savviness” with technology and the degree to
blank         | 
text          | which they harnessed these tools. However, families’ use of these technologies included
blank         | 
text          | sophisticated strategies for learning as well as inventiveness and ingenuity in approaching
blank         | 
text          | challenges often with limited resources. These examples also revealed ways in which
blank         | 
text          | media tools may be leveraged for purposes that were not necessarily intended or dreamed
blank         | 
text          | of by designers and producers, such as using translator apps for support in completing
blank         | 
text          | homework. These uses in turn illuminate new possibilities and opportunities for design,
blank         | 
text          | further discussed in Chapter Eight.
blank         | 
text          |        Finally, family media practices discussed in this chapter support other evidence of the
blank         | 
text          | value Hispanic-Latino families place on education (e.g. Valdés, 1996). This value was
blank         | 
text          | applied both to their children’s education, which was a priority, and parents’ own
blank         | 
text          | continued learning as adults. Case parents in this study actively pursued knowledge and
blank         | 
text          | leveraged media in intentional and strategic ways to support their children’s schooling
blank         | 
text          | and/or to advance their own studies or careers for the benefit of their families. In this

blank         | 
text          | households (Reissman, 1962). The finding that families value learning and education,
blank         | 
text          | and actively pursue these ends, is not surprising to those who have worked closely with
blank         | 
text          | families in this population. One faces the challenge of somehow reinforcing deficit
blank         | 
text          | models, simply by framing findings in a way that disputes them (why should we be
blank         | 
text          | surprised that families value education and employ technologies to pursue it?). However,
blank         | 
text          | I would like to emphasize the ways this study adds additional evidence in support of
blank         | 
text          | efforts to question and overturn models that view families from low-income and/or non-
blank         | 
text          | dominant backgrounds as deficient where motivation to learn and support schooling is
blank         | 
text          | concerned.

blank         | 
text          | among this sample of case families. In these practices families strategically took up
blank         | 
text          | Internet tools including translator apps, online videos and others provided academic
blank         | 
text          | support and informational resources to reach specific goals or deliberately explore a topic.
blank         | 
text          | However, the vast majority of time families spent with screen media was dedicated to
blank         | 
text          | leisure or playful activities, broadly defined, not for the express purpose of learning or
blank         | 
text          | finding information. In all of the families that participated in this study – as in families
blank         | 
text          | from many cultural backgrounds and walks of life – media played a role as a centerpiece
blank         | 
text          | for family time at home that provided amusement and playful activities. I draw a
blank         | 
text          | distinction between this type of media use and the “knowledge seeking” activities of
blank         | 
text          | Chapter Four where media served as a reference tool or provided direct support for
blank         | 
text          | finding information or supporting studies.
blank         | 
text          |        Data in this chapter supports another major finding in this study: all families used
blank         | 
text          | media content in both Spanish and English, and parents felt that using many of these
blank         | 
text          | media programs contributed to their children’s language and literacy development, as
blank         | 
text          | well as in some cases to their own. I reiterate here that classifying this media use as a
blank         | 
text          | “leisure activity” or “entertainment” is based on the motivation for engaging with the
blank         | 
text          | media in question and does not suggest that some of these programs did not also have an
blank         | 
text          | educational value or meaningful role in families’ language and literacy environment. On
blank         | 
text          | the contrary – for the families in the present study, television, online video and to some
blank         | 
text          | extent games or apps provided a regular stream of spoken and written language in the

text          | home environments of participating families. Children and their families engaged with a
blank         | 
text          | variety of “educational” programs designed with particular learning goals. Other adult
blank         | 
text          | and children’s programs they chose were not designed with the goal of providing
blank         | 
text          | educational content, but still offered learning opportunities. Indeed as Mehus and
blank         | 
text          | Stevens (2011) illustrate in their ethnographic field study, learning interactions may not
blank         | 
text          | relate to learning goals of a program, and may occur around non-educational programs.
blank         | 
text          | The purpose of the media activities in the following examples, however, was primarily
blank         | 
text          | for family entertainment or specifically for entertaining the child(ren). As discussed in
blank         | 
text          | the previous chapter, the grouping of “intentional learning” versus “learning in the leisure
blank         | 
text          | space” is not mutually exclusive and is better described as a spectrum of activities. To
blank         | 
text          | illustrate this point, one case example of Naomi Aguirre and DIY crafts videos she
blank         | 
text          | discovered on YouTube demonstrates how “leisure-time” media can flow into other
blank         | 
text          | activities that involve seeking knowledge or instruction.
blank         | 
text          |        Based on observations and descriptions of media routines reported in interviews, this
blank         | 
text          | category of use occupied more time in the family routine than did the intentional uses of
blank         | 
text          | technology for seeking information or instruction described in Chapter Four. For
blank         | 
text          | example, while for most families one to two hours watching television or videos in the
blank         | 
text          | evening or after school was part of the daily routine, it was less common overall for
blank         | 
text          | family members to spend one to two hours each day with the activities described in
blank         | 
text          | Chapter Four. It is important to keep in mind once again that the children in this study
blank         | 
text          | were in early elementary grades, and thus the more in-depth research projects and
blank         | 
text          | compositions assigned in upper elementary or middle school were not yet a large part of
blank         | 
text          | their day-to-day homework.

text          |        The four sections to follow correspond to four major findings that emerged from the
blank         | 
text          | data:
blank         | 
text          | I.        English language was present in all case family homes via English-language
              |           media. Families accessed a variety of media content in both English and Spanish.
              |           All seven families’ regular media routines included content in both languages, as
              |           documented by observational and interview reports. Thus children, and to some
              |           extent parents, all received regular “input” in both languages via media content.
              |           Most of the English-language media was children’s programs.
blank         | 
text          | II.       Parents believed that media was a language learning resource. Parents
              |           expressed that media in English helped their children to learn the language. Some
              |           parents also expressed that they learned some amount of English from engaging
              |           with media together with their children. All parents believed it was important for
              |           their children to know both English and Spanish, and described ways they felt
              |           media contributed to these objectives. Many children talked or sang along with
              |           media in English and sometimes discussed or explained English words when
              |           watching with parents (observed during visits and also reported on the Families
              |           and Media survey).
blank         | 
text          | III.      Families, including children, engaged in media production (as well as
              |           consumption) practices.
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
text          |        The corresponding sections in this chapter present instances and patterns related to
blank         | 
text          | joint media engagement practices and how they emerged naturally among families’
blank         | 
text          | media-related activities. These joint practices between parents and children (or in some
blank         | 
text          | cases among siblings or peers) are highlighted as they arise in each section.
blank         | 
text          |        As the title suggests, this chapter focuses on the affordances of leisure-time media use
blank         | 
text          | for contributing to language and literacy learning experiences. Although the instruments
blank         | 
text          | in the present study cannot determine precise developmental or learning outcomes related
blank         | 
text          | to these media practices, the theoretical and empirical literature indicates the potential of
blank         | 
text          | media to contribute to language acquisition and “environmental text” to contribute to
blank         | 
text          | literacy.
blank         |

blank         | 	  
              | 	  
text          |        Further, several empirical studies have asserted the potential for television to
blank         | 
text          | contribute to first or second language acquisition (e.g. Rice, 1983; Lemish and Rice,
blank         | 
text          | 1986; Uchikochi, 2006; 2008). As regards literacy, research has long regarded children’s
blank         | 
text          | contact with environmental print – written language that surrounds learners – as an
blank         | 
text          | important factor in literacy development (e.g. Heath, 1983, Baghaban, 1984, Vukelich,
blank         | 
text          | 1994) and which arguably could be displayed on a screen, rather than in printed form.
blank         | 
text          | Thus the information on the content used and social interactions around media activities
blank         | 
text          | is useful for understanding the types of exposure children and families had to these
blank         | 
text          | various language inputs, and can point to new directions for investigation. This
blank         | 
text          | understanding can help future research can target the goal of articulating precisely what
blank         | 
text          | family members learned from watching or using media programs.
blank         | 
text          |        What I refer to as “leisure time media” encompassed considerable time in family
blank         | 
text          | routines – these media activities were prominent after school, on weekends and during
blank         | 
text          | school vacations. These data are consistent with large-scale national survey reports that
blank         | 
text          | show an average of two to three hours per day of screen time among children, with some
blank         | 
text          | variation between ethnic and socio-economic groups but relatively large amounts across
blank         | 
text          | the board (Common Sense Media, 2011, 2013; Rideout, 2014). Due to the very
blank         | 
text          | prevalence of media in families’ home lives and the linguistic and textual nature of a
blank         | 
text          | great deal of the programs observed, I argue for the importance of studying these forms
blank         | 
text          | of media use and shedding further light on the role that media programs might play in
blank         | 
text          | language and literacy development.
blank         | 
text          |        It is also important to highlight that I do not attempt to place a value judgment on
blank         | 
text          | families’ overall use of screen media, indeed I believe it extremely challenging
blank         |

              |

              | 	  
text          |      methodologically to do so in a comprehensive and reliable manner. Whether the families’
blank         | 
text          |      total media use constitutes a “good” or “bad” use of their time is not the focus of this
blank         | 
text          |      analysis. Instead, the goals of the chapter are to identify and qualify aspects of families’
blank         | 
text          |      leisure-time media use specifically as it relates to their language and literacy experiences
blank         | 
text          |      and potential affordances for these purposes. Using this frame, I reveal families’ ecology
blank         | 
text          |      of media activities in the home, including the language(s) of the content they accessed,
blank         | 
text          |      and their underlying beliefs about relationships between media use and language learning.
blank         | 
text          |      In this way my hope is to offer more understanding about these aspects of families’
blank         | 
text          |      media use and help provide a foundation for future research and design efforts that build
blank         | 
text          |      on families’ existing frameworks and repertoires of practice (Gutiérrez & Rogoff, 2003).

              |      language environment
blank         | 
text          |                This section presents evidence from the qualitative data that case families accessed
blank         | 
text          |      media in both Spanish and English (as well as occasionally in other languages via
blank         | 
text          |      YouTube). In terms of leisure time use, children’s programs were the primary vehicle by
blank         | 
text          |      which English-language media content came into households, however as shared later in
blank         | 
text          |      the chapter some parents reported that they watched the news or other programs in
blank         | 
text          |      English, with the specific intent of improving their language skills. Some adults (and
blank         | 
text          |      children) also consumed English-language programs with or without captions or Spanish
blank         | 
text          |      subtitles. In this way, in addition to the ways that children may bring language home –
blank         | 
text          |             through reading materials from school or language they have learned with their peers and
blank         | 
text          |      teachers – they also “brought” English into the home environment via the media that they

              | 
footer        |                                                       192

              |      	  
text          | chose or that their parents selected for them (content which arguably may not have been
blank         | 
text          | present in the homes if there were no children). At the same time, all families also used
blank         | 
text          | Spanish-language media regularly, for entertaining either or both generations and as a
blank         | 
text          | way of connecting with the country of origin (as discussed in Chapter Six).
blank         | 
text          |        It is also important to contextualize this information within the setting of parents’
blank         | 
text          | language-related values their goals for children’s learning. All parents interviewed
blank         | 
text          | expressed that it was important for their children to know both English and Spanish. No
blank         | 
text          | parent was unconcerned with their children’s English learning, recognizing that English
blank         | 
text          | would be vital for their future success. At the same time all parents also expressed that it
blank         | 
text          | was important to them that their children maintain their Spanish fluency; some of them
blank         | 
text          | also pointed out that speaking Spanish (as well as English) could be a future professional
blank         | 
text          | advantage for their children, in addition to being their means of communication with
blank         | 
text          | family.
blank         | 
text          |        Although families ranged widely in the types of media they consumed, television
blank         | 
text          | and/or video programs were common across all cases. In terms of the media platforms
blank         | 
text          | families used prior to the iPad intervention, findings from this study overall support those
blank         | 
text          | of national survey reports indicating that although children’s access to mobile devices has
blank         | 
text          | increased dramatically in recent years and time children spend with these devices tripled,
blank         | 
text          | television is still dominant among media platforms that children use (Common Sense
blank         | 
text          | Media 2011, 2013; Rideout, 2014). In the present case studies, six out of the seven
blank         | 
text          | families watched television regularly prior to receiving their iPads. The seventh family,
blank         | 
text          | Rebeca Rivera and her daughters, had previously used TV and DVDs but now relied
blank         | 
text          | mainly on mobiles, particularly online video of popular television shows. The Aguirre

blank         | 
text          | Netflix streamed content rather than the public broadcast stations they had access to.
blank         | 
text          | Television programs (broadcast or streamed on-demand) were present during a variety of
blank         | 
text          | family activities, either as a focus of attention or in the background, with attention often
blank         | 
text          | shifting back and forth. Interview and observational data prior to the iPad intervention
blank         | 
text          | also show television as the most prevalent media platform overall, even if this was not the
blank         | 
text          | case in every family. On parent surveys, six of the seven parents reported their child
blank         | 
text          | watching television the day prior, with only one parent reporting the use of a different
blank         | 
text          | platform (smartphone).

blank         | 
text          | research, the above examples highlight the multiple ways families accessed content and
blank         | 
text          | how new media platforms call into question the very definition of what “television” is,
blank         | 
text          | blurring lines traditionally used to distinguish between different media activities. For
blank         | 
text          | example, the same Netflix content (an episode of Little Pet Shop or the movie Toy Story 3,
blank         | 
text          | for instance) can be accessed either on a television, computer or mobile device. In
blank         | 
text          | addition, boundaries between “television” and “movies” begin to disappear as feature
blank         | 
text          | films are more and more accessible via television channels, on-demand programs, online
blank         | 
text          | video platforms, and so on. Web sites such as Cartoon Network or PBSKids could be
blank         | 
text          | categorized as web resources, but they also contain both videos (content also aired on
blank         | 
text          | TV) and games. This changing nature of media content and access complicates

footer        |                                                         195

blank         | 
text          | survey research (e.g. Common Sense Media 2011, 2013; Rideout, 2014). To more
blank         | 
text          | accurately capture findings related to family media use, in Tables 5b and 5c I categorize
blank         | 
text          | content as either:
blank         | 
text          |        1. television and video (television programs, online videos, movies, etc.), or
blank         | 
text          |        2. interactive programs (games, apps).
blank         | 
text          | Moreover I argue that given today’s range of content and access points, a focus on
blank         | 
text          | content is as or more important than a focus on the particular device or platform used.
blank         | 
text          | While maintaining an emphasis on content over platform, when describing examples I
blank         | 
text          | note devices used and any implications this might have for how the media activity takes
blank         | 
text          | place.
blank         | 
text          |        As noted in the opening of this section, the media content that families used was by
blank         | 
text          | no means monolingual, particularly with respect to children’s programs. All seven
blank         | 
text          | participant families described media “diets” that included children regularly watching
blank         | 
text          | programs in both Spanish and English. This finding is consistent with other reports (Katz,
blank         | 
text          | 2007; Katz, 2010) that Hispanic-Latino immigrant families access media content in both
blank         | 
text          | languages. Although the vast majority of content was one of those two languages,
blank         | 
text          | searching for videos on YouTube occasionally yielded results that were in other
blank         | 
text          | languages as well. During observations, children watched YouTube videos of familiar
blank         | 
text          | characters in such languages as French, Italian, Dutch and Korean by initially accessing a
blank         | 
text          | video of a favorite character or program in English or Spanish (e.g. Mickey Mouse or
blank         | 
text          | Dora the Explorer) and then choosing additional videos based on the “suggestions” that
blank         | 
text          | appeared afterwards which included content in a range of languages. In these cases,
blank         |

              |

text          | children selected videos based on the visual information presented (thumbnail images of
blank         | 
text          | the programs) and only realized the language of the content once the video began playing.
blank         | 
text          |        As the data above begins to suggest, online video platforms, primarily YouTube as
blank         | 
text          | observed in this study but also to some extent video streaming services such as Netflix,
blank         | 
text          | emerge as disruptors in many aspects. While television alone generally broadcasts one or
blank         | 
text          | two episodes of any given show at a given time, YouTube or Netflix can allow users to
blank         | 
text          | search and watch multiple videos from the same program or genre, and/or point users to
blank         | 
text          | content identified (by algorithms) as of interest to viewers of the previous one. YouTube
blank         | 
text          | is also disruptive in terms of the variety of content languages presented to children, who
blank         | 
text          | searched for and selected content based on characters and visual elements, not necessarily
blank         | 
text          | based on language. Even search terms entered in one language (e.g. “películas para
blank         | 
text          | niños”) could and often did yield results and suggested content in one or more other
blank         | 
text          | languages. As Rebeca Rivera explained:
blank         | 
              | 
text          | A veces se lo pongo y dice en español, se lo          Sometimes I put it on and it says in Spanish, I put it
              | pongo en español, pero a veces como… ves…             on in Spanish, but sometimes since, you see… when
              | ya ve que cuando usted escribe en YouTube los         you type something into YouTube the videos, a list
              | videos, luego le aparece una lista. […] Ya, ve…       appears right away. […] Yeah, so… because she is
              | porque ella es bien desesperada, entonces             really frantic [to watch], so I just press the first one
              | nomás le apachurro lo primero que me                  that appears, because she’s so frantic.

              | 
text          | Most parents, like Rebeca, reported that at each session they usually helped their children
blank         | 
text          | find the first video selection on YouTube. However after this first search children were
blank         | 
text          | able to choose further videos with or without their parents’ support simply by pressing
blank         | 
text          | the “suggestions” – thumbnails of related videos that appear on the screen when a
blank         | 
text          | selection has finished playing.

text          |        According to parent reports and observational data, most of the English-language
blank         | 
text          | content in households was children’s programming, which parents sometimes co-engaged
blank         | 
text          | with actively or in passing. In part, the choice whether to watch content in English or
blank         | 
text          | Spanish came as a result of what was available in the moment – for example families
blank         | 
text          | described how children watched Dora the Explorer in English when it aired on
blank         | 
text          | Nickelodeon, but how on weekends when the show aired on Spanish-language channel
blank         | 
text          | Univisión, they would watch it in Spanish. Children in homes with cable packages could
blank         | 
text          | choose from a wide range of shows on Nickelodeon and other English-language channels
blank         | 
text          | such as Disney XD or Cartoon Network. Although some cable packages did offer the
blank         | 
text          | option of substituting Spanish audio for English language shows, these were not available
blank         | 
text          | for every network and program. Netflix programs (used frequently in the Aguirre
blank         | 
text          | household and occasionally by Estela Morales at her cousins’ home) were in English only,
blank         | 
text          | often with subtitling available. In short, there were a variety of permutations of media
blank         | 
text          | “menus” that families had access to, but all families regularly accessed some content in

blank         | 
text          | focused on those features. The primary example I observed was with two Wii programs
blank         | 
text          | that the Aguirre children played, that were fairly rich in language. These two programs
blank         | 
text          | were Skylander, which included dialogue with captioned text, and Just Dance, which was
blank         | 
text          | song-based and the lyrics appeared as captions (karaoke-style). With Just Dance, while
blank         | 
text          | the children focused on emulating the dance routines that were modeled on the screen,
blank         | 
text          | their mother Lorena sat on the sofa. Instead of watching the children’s enthusiastic
blank         | 
text          | dancing, Lorena focused on the subtitled song lyrics. When asked about it, Lorena
blank         | 
text          | explained that if she didn’t know the song, she liked to read the subtitles to try to
blank         | 
text          | understand the meaning of the lyrics.
blank         | 
text          |        The other game the family used, the action-adventure game Skylander, was a favorite
blank         | 
text          | of six-year-old Eduardo’s although older sister Naomi found the game “boring.” The
blank         | 
text          | children’s eleven-year-old cousin Carlos acted as a mentor for Eduardo, coaching him in
blank         | 
text          | game-play. It was unclear how much of the narration and verbal guidance from the game
blank         | 
text          | itself was within Eduardo’s zone of proximal development in terms of English language
blank         | 
text          | use. However, the messages were linked directly to actions and back-stories within the
blank         | 
text          | game. This format presented a potential opportunity for Eduardo to engage in listening or
blank         | 
text          | reading to understand the English language present, particularly given his strong
blank         | 
text          | engagement with the game. However, further study is needed in order to fully understand
blank         | 
text          | how young English learners like Eduardo might access meaning from the language in
blank         | 
text          | these games as well as how necessary it is to understand these messages in order to be
blank         | 
text          | successful at the game.

text          |        The video game Halo, which Saúl and David Martínez played on the family laptop,
blank         | 
text          | also had extensive back story and narration captioned on the screen. The boys however
blank         | 
text          | did not show evidence of attending to this text and expressed that they did not understand
blank         | 
text          | what it said. In this case, this language input did not appear to be comprehensible to Saúl
blank         | 
text          | and David at the level of English (and reading) that they possessed at that time, and as
blank         | 
text          | game-play did not require players necessarily to understand it, they could continue
blank         | 
text          | engaging with the game without paying attention to it. However, video games in this
blank         | 
text          | genre are widely used and further study could explore how text and narration in video
blank         | 
text          | games might contribute to language or literacy development in more advanced learners.
blank         | 
text          |        Finally one example showed how watching video for entertainment led to
blank         | 
text          | interest in a hands-on activity. Eight-year-old Naomi Aguirre developed a
blank         | 
text          | practice of self-directed, interest-driven learning with online videos in English.
blank         | 
text          | One of the two oldest children in the sample, Naomi began watching a series of
blank         | 
text          | DIY instructional videos (in English) for building elaborate environments,
blank         | 
text          | accessories, buildings and furniture for dolls. She discovered the series by
blank         | 
text          | accident, following a series of YouTube video suggestions that led her from
blank         | 
text          | watching the popular program Monster High (her initial search on YouTube) to
blank         | 
text          | another show called Seven Supergirls. When Naomi was done watching the
blank         | 
text          | latter, the My Froggy Stuff videos appeared as suggestions for further viewing
blank         | 
text          | and Naomi became interested in the detailed projects the videos demonstrate how

text          | to build, step-by-step and using low-cost everyday materials.

text          | – Parent interview 1, Karina Parra
blank         | 
text          |         In the previous section, the data shows that the seven case families all
blank         | 
text          | incorporated English-language media in their daily routines. The examples shared in this
blank         | 
text          | section, as in the excerpt above, illustrate parents’ beliefs that exposure to media in
blank         | 
text          | English has been valuable in helping their children learn the language and that sometimes
blank         | 
text          | their learning was passed along to adults in the family as well. Karina Parra’s quote also
blank         | 
text          | echoes findings from the Sesame Street “Early Window Project” (Wright et al., 2001)
blank         | 
text          | that native Spanish speakers learning English saw co-viewing children’s television with
blank         | 
text          | their children as an activity that could help improve their own English skills. In Karina’s
blank         | 
text          | case, it is interesting to note that she found value not through watching but through
blank         | 
text          | simultaneous conversation with her daughter about the program, reflecting perhaps an
blank         | 
text          | early stage of the child in developing a role as “media broker” (Katz, 2007; 2010). While
blank         | 
text          | parent beliefs are subjective, they offer a view of what language- and literacy-related
blank         | 
text          | experiences media might be providing and how parents – partial but consistently present
blank         | 
text          | observers – perceive media’s influence on children’s learning.

text          |        On surveys and in interviews, all parents expressed the view that media in English
blank         | 
text          | had helped their children to learn the language, whether because parents intentionally
blank         | 
text          | exposed them to English-language media (as suggested in Karina Parra’s quote at the
blank         | 
text          | start of this section) or as a byproduct of media that parents did not necessarily intend for.
blank         | 
text          | All parents in the present study responded that his or her child had learned “some” or “a
blank         | 
text          | lot” about “reading or vocabulary” (language not specified) from using at least one media
blank         | 
text          | platform (see Table 5d). All parents also perceived that educational media (any platform)
blank         | 
text          | had helped their children learn English either “a lot” or “some” (see Table 5e). As shown
blank         | 
text          | in Table 5d, parents felt that TV/DVD and mobile platforms were had contributed most
blank         | 
text          | to children’s reading or vocabulary learning (although computers were also considered

text          |          One of the ways that parents sometimes attributed their child’s English learning was
blank         | 
text          | when the child actively talked or sang along with characters in media programs. This
blank         | 
text          | practice, which parents described but children also engaged in during some observations,
blank         | 
text          | demonstrates children’s attention to the program at hand and provides an observable way
blank         | 
text          | in which media elicited language production and practice. In the research literature,
blank         | 
text          | higher outcomes in child vocabulary and expressive language have been linked to the
blank         | 
text          | frequency with which children watched shows with this format, “where onscreen
blank         | 
text          | characters speak directly to the child, actively elicit participation, label objects, and
blank         | 
text          | provide opportunities to respond,” including Dora the Explorer as one of the prime
blank         | 
text          | examples (Linebarger & Walker, 2005, p. 16). In an interview, Karina expressed her
blank         |

text          |        Examples of children’s interactions with media programs also occurred with other

text          | interspersing of pop-style songs throughout, and the characters actively encourage

text          | where Spanish was the primary language of instruction in the early grades and literacy

blank         | 
text          | were concerned that their children were becoming English-dominant and not developing

text          | their Spanish skills sufficiently. Rebeca Rivera in particular was concerned that her

text          | favored speaking English over Spanish, even at home – a challenge she had not

text          | encountered with her older daughter Jessica. One benefit she felt media brought was

text          | exposing Yelitza to Spanish language content and the positive results she perceived.

text          |        Several parents expressed their view that the children’s media that they watched with
blank         | 
text          | their kids helped them improve their own knowledge of English. At the beginning of this
blank         | 
text          | section Karina’s quote refers to her learning as a function not only of watching the
blank         | 
text          | children’s programs but of simultaneously talking with her daughter and her daughter
blank         | 
text          | “teaching” her. Carmen Orozco, mother of six-year-old Brandon, recalled the same
blank         | 
text          | phenomenon:
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Carmen: Son raras las palabritas que le                      Carmen: The words I understand are few,
              | entiendo yo y que, pues que yo le pregunto a                 so I ask [Brandon]: “Look, what’s the kid
              | [Brandon]: “Mire, ¿qué dice el niño?” o algo.                saying?,” or something. I ask him,
              | Le pregunto a él ¿Qué dice el niño?, le                      “What’s the kid saying,” if he’s speaking
              | pregunto, si él viene hablando así inglés… […]               English […] So sometimes he tells me
              | Pues en veces él me dice “Mami, eso… mira,                   “Mami, that… look, look,” he says, “that
              | mira”, me dice, “eso quiere decir esta cosa”, y              means this,” and he tells me.
              | ya me dice.

text          | In these cases, the language on television prompted parents to ask their children to
blank         | 
text          | translate for them, which presents learning affordances for the parent to learn meanings
blank         | 
text          | of words or phrases (provided children accurately translate or explain what was said) and
blank         | 
text          | child, who has an opportunity to teach the parent using his or her dual language skills. At
blank         | 
text          | the same time some examples also emerged in which parents guided children to
blank         | 
text          | understand the meaning of something they identified in a program. For example,

text          | went to sleep, with either Spanish subtitles or sometimes English captioning if Spanish

text          | subtitles were not available. Although they watched the movies primarily for

blank         | 
text          | language captions (Neuman & Koskinen, 1992)13. Only the Acosta and Aguirre families
blank         | 
text          | reported watching the news in English or using English captioning to improve language
blank         | 
text          | skills (although there was no specific prompt asking whether or not parents used
blank         | 
text          | captioning as a tool). Lorena and Eduardo had the most formal schooling among the
blank         | 
text          | parents in the study, many of whom had a primary or middle school education. Their
blank         | 
text          | interest in using subtitles for learning raises the question of whether and how more
blank         | 
text          | advanced schooling (possibly indicating higher literacy), may influence language-

text          | learning strategies in regard to media and subtitles or captions.

text          | the iPad intervention was generally not as rich in terms of modeling or intentionally
blank         | 
text          | soliciting language. When parents were asked about the learning value of media for their
blank         | 
text          | children, they often referred to the television and video programs rather than to the
blank         | 
text          | interactive games or apps. However there were some instances were parents expressed

text          | their view that the interactive programs their children used offered language-learning
blank         | 
text          | opportunities. For example, Brandon Orozco had a strong interest in sports-based web
blank         | 
text          | games and mobile apps that, although they were largely action-based, did include some
blank         | 
text          | vocabulary (in English) that José Rubén felt Brandon learned from by connecting words

text          | The differences in perception of language learning between television and video and
blank         | 
text          | interactive games may also be related to the fact that most of the educational content

text          | (programs designed with specific learning goals) children used were in the former
blank         | 
text          | category, not the latter. It is difficult to disentangle whether parents felt games and apps
blank         | 
text          | were overall less powerful for language learning than television and video and this view
blank         | 
text          | affected the media they selected for their families, or whether other factors were at play.
blank         | 
text          | Television and video, the more traditional media platforms, may have been more familiar
blank         | 
text          | to parents than the relatively new market of mobile apps and games. Another possible
blank         | 
text          | explanation is that television networks broadcast educational shows on well-known
blank         | 
text          | networks targeted for children such as PBSKids and Nickelodeon, whereas locating and
blank         | 
text          | purchasing quality educational apps and games may be much less intuitive. Mobile apps
blank         | 
text          | and games may also incur additional cost, on top of fixed cable and/or Internet
blank         | 
text          | subscriptions that families had. All of these lines of reasoning were raised in a related
blank         | 
text          | study where participants were affluent, highly educated English-speaking families

text          | (Barron et al., in preparation). Many parents did not highly value apps and games as

text          |           To summarize this section, parents perceived that the media content their children
blank         | 
text          | used, particularly television and video (as opposed to interactive content) contributed
blank         | 
text          | positively to their children’s language and literacy experiences. The language and
blank         | 
text          | literacy experiences that this media offered included hearing and responding to verbal
blank         | 
text          | prompts, connecting vocabulary with visual actions onscreen and engaging in
blank         | 
text          | conversations with parents based on the content they were seeing. These activities
blank         | 
text          | spurred by media use, which parents reported and I also observed during visits, are linked
blank         | 
text          | to cognitive development including language development. In addition, parents felt that
blank         | 
text          | media use, such as watching programs with their children or watching movies with
blank         | 
text          | subtitles or captions, also provided useful language learning experiences for themselves
blank         | 
text          | as adult English learners.

title         | III. Media Production
blank         | 
text          |        While all case families regularly watched television and/or video, some families also
blank         | 
text          | engaged in producing video and/or watching themselves onscreen as recorded by others.
blank         | 
text          | Parents in five of the seven families reported taking video of their children in different
blank         | 
text          | situations, particularly school performances, and/or showed me videos they had recorded.
blank         | 
text          | Parents enjoyed taking photos of their children and sharing these with friends and family
blank         | 
text          | by email or using social media. The children in the study were aware that their parents’
blank         | 
text          | mobile phones could create images, as well as display them. Children themselves enjoyed
blank         | 
text          | taking photos or videos of outings and gatherings but also sometimes around the house.
blank         | 
text          | Bryanna Parra enjoyed using the video camera or the audio recording app on her
blank         | 
text          | mother’s iPhone to record herself singing or making sounds, and took videos of her

blank         | 
text          | parents’ phones, or in Brandon Orozco’s case he used the camera feature on his Nintendo
blank         | 
text          | DS to take photographs and enhance them with 3-D effects. As Christmastime
blank         | 
text          | approached, parents and children gleefully and carefully decorated Christmas trees,
blank         | 
text          | sometimes even reorganizing their small living rooms to accommodate a tree over six
blank         | 
text          | feet tall, and taking photographs to capture the holiday mood.
blank         | 
text          |         Media production is an important aspect of technology use to consider for several
blank         | 
text          | reasons. First, as members of the New London Group (1996) posit, the ability to
blank         | 
text          | communicate in multiple modes beyond traditional text, such as photography, video and
blank         | 
text          | graphics, will become increasingly vital in the twenty-first century. These abilities, or
blank         | 
text          | “multiliteracies” as termed by the New London Group, are important skills for
blank         | 
text          | communicating in a world that is ever more populated with diverse forms of media, and
blank         | 
text          | the ability to produce or “write” in these forms is essential to full participation in society.
blank         | 
text          | As Goodman (2003) argues, these skills are all the more important for youth from
blank         | 
text          | underrepresented groups:
blank         | 
text          |        Historically, the way in which poor and other marginalized groups have managed to become
              |        visible, to demand political recognition and economic rights, has been through the acquisition of
              |        literacy in the dominant medium. However, the dominant medium is changing. Learning to read
              |        and write the printed word is still essential, but is no longer sufficient (p. 4).
blank         | 
text          | Finally, production offers opportunities for learners to engage their interests in projects
blank         | 
text          | that utilize their skills (often including language) and explore topics of interest. Barron
blank         | 
text          | (2006) highlights several ways that young people’s interest-based production activities
blank         | 
text          | including video were sustained across different settings in the learners’ lives, leading to a
blank         | 
text          | cycle of increasing depth in interest and learning. Following these and other arguments,
blank         | 
text          | in- and out-of-school interventions in underserved communities such as the Digital Youth

blank         | 
text          | technology and developing “digital citizenship” (Barron et al., 2014).
blank         | 
text          |        The iPad intervention offered new opportunities for media production (see Chapter
blank         | 
text          | Seven), but prior to receiving their iPads children in three case families showed the most
blank         | 
text          | pronounced interest in video production and watching home videos. Naomi Aguirre was
blank         | 
text          | the most active in creating her own videos (in Spanish with certain words or phrases in
blank         | 
text          | English), which were rich in language and featured her and her younger brother Eduardo
blank         | 
text          | as “presenters.” The depth and regularity of Naomi’s production practice reflects her
blank         | 
text          | father’s interest and values regarding media production and the arts. As the parent
blank         | 
text          | interview excerpt below shows, Naomi’s parents recognized and encouraged Naomi’s
blank         | 
text          | interest in these activities as it emerged:

              | 
text          | Eduardo: A Naomi le gusta mucho inventar           Eduardo: Naomi really likes to make up songs.

              | Amber: ¿Ah, sí?                                    E: She sings a lot of songs. Then she makes up
              | E: Canta muchas canciones. Luego hace letras       lyrics and asks me: what do you think? And she
              | y me dice: Mira papi, ¿qué te parece? Y la         starts singing it, and I say ‘Listen, that sounds

              | A: ¿Y hay algún programa en la computadora o       or phone, that they use?
              | en los teléfonos, que utilizan?                    E: She uses the microphone application a lot to

text          | In addition to encouraging these production activities, Eduardo also pursued media
blank         | 
text          | production hobbies himself. He studied communications in Mexico and had a strong
blank         | 
text          | interest in film and video production. At home, he modeled and encouraged these
blank         | 
text          | activities.

              | 
text          | P: Bueno, a mí me ha interesado eso, lo de             Eduardo: I’ve been interested in that, in
              | fotografía. Luego les enseño las fotos que tomo,       photography. So I’ll show [the children] photos I
              | cómo las puedo ir mejorando y todo eso.                take, how I can improve them and all that. I’ve

              | trato de enseñar una canción que me gusta              song I like a lot, and I try to say to them, ‘Would
              | mucho, y les trato de decir: ¿te gustaría tocar la     you like to play the guitar like [the musician] is
              | guitarra como la está tocando? Y dicen: No, sí,        playing?’ And they say, ‘No, yes, it sounds cool,’
              | se oye chido, y entonces…                              and so…
              | A: ¿Ellos tocan instrumentos?                          Amber: Do they play instruments?
              | P: No, pero es lo que les digo, trato de decirles      Eduardo: No, but I tell them, I try to tell them that
              | que cuando llegue el momento pueden tomar              when the time comes that they can take guitar or
              | lecciones de guitarra o de piano. Entonces este,       piano lessons. So I try to tell them that, because
              | trato de decirles eso, porque siempre me ha            I’ve always loved music, photography, film,

              | 
              | 
text          | In this quote, Eduardo draws attention to the way he acts as a “learning partner” (Barron,
blank         | 
text          | Martin, Takeuchi & Fithian, 2007) in Naomi’s pursuit of media production. Applying
blank         | 
text          | some of the roles that these authors identified (among parents in middle-class Silicon
blank         | 
text          | Valley families roles in their children’s technology activities), Eduardo Sr. can be seen
blank         | 
text          | acting as “teacher” and “learning broker,” both directly instructing Naomi and her brother
blank         | 
text          | in photography skills (teacher role) and providing the tools and encouragement for Naomi
blank         | 
text          | to create her own productions.
blank         | 
text          |          Besides her father, the media Naomi watched was also influential in the style she
blank         | 
text          | chose for her videos. Naomi enjoyed the Nickelodeon program iCarly, a teen show about
blank         | 
text          | a girl who produced her own webcast along with her group of friends. Using her own

blank         | 
text          | and other characters on the iCarly program often did) and incorporating her six-year-old
blank         | 
text          | brother Eduardo as cameraman or as a “guest” on the show. Although iCarly is in
blank         | 
text          | English, Naomi and Eduardo narrated the shows in Spanish. Some elements of Naomi’s
blank         | 
text          | style are reminiscent of on-location television newscasts or talk shows, and may be linked
blank         | 
text          | to watching these common genres as well.

text          |        The video transcript excerpt shared below was drawn from a video that Naomi and
blank         | 
text          | her brother had recorded using Naomi’s iPod touch. The inspiration from television
blank         | 
text          | shows shines through in several features of the video. Naomi in particular used a tone and
blank         | 
text          | manner that mimicked TV presenters, even including “commercial breaks” where she and
blank         | 
text          | Eduardo cover the camera and are heard counting to ten in a whisper before they returned
blank         | 
text          | with the next segment. There were also “commercials” where Naomi and Eduardo
blank         | 
text          | advertise products such as the moisturizing lotion their mother has on her bureau. Below
blank         | 
text          | is an excerpt of a show that the children created in their parents’ bedroom. At the

text          | opening, Eduardo is recording Naomi as she introduces the show and the themes of the

text          | day, beginning with el miedo (fear) and, after the “commercial break,” the theme of la

              | 
text          | In their video, Naomi and Eduardo used their experience watching programs, particularly
blank         | 
text          | Naomi’s with iCarly, as a template for creating their own show that shares themes from
blank         | 
text          | their lives as well as topics (such as recycling and conserving wildlife) that they may
blank         | 
text          | have been introduced to in school. In this way Naomi and Eduardo, who consumed a
blank         | 
text          | variety of different media programs, also leveraged this experience to express their own
blank         | 
text          | voices and share – to a palpable audience – topics of concern and interest to them. This
blank         | 
text          | example also illustrates Dugan et al’s (2007) point that media programs that are not
blank         | 
text          | necessarily designed as “educational” can give rise to learning interactions and activities.
blank         | 
text          | In this case, Naomi used the model demonstrated by iCarly and perhaps other programs
blank         | 
text          | to create an activity for her and her brother that used their language skills and vocabulary
blank         | 
text          | and provided a forum to share their ideas and knowledge on different topics. In addition,
blank         | 
text          | as Naomi’s father Eduardo (senior) expresses in the previously shared quote, media
blank         | 
text          | production was a practice that was not only encouraged and supported in their household,
blank         | 
text          | but was also modeled as he pursued his own production practice and drew the children
blank         | 
text          | into it. Shooting video during outings and taking photos was a popular family activity,
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
footer        |                                                   223

blank         | 
text          | video camera to their large television set and looking through family photos and videos
blank         | 
text          | together.
blank         | 
text          |        The Acosta family also particularly enjoyed taking family videos, and used a video
blank         | 
text          | camera to record special occasions like Amanda’s preschool graduation or the girls’
blank         | 
text          | birthday parties. Although five-year-old Amanda and two-year-old Susi had not yet
blank         | 
text          | begun to record their own videos with the family video camera, they were highly engaged
blank         | 
text          | by the videos their parents made. Amanda and Susi often enjoyed watching these videos,
blank         | 
text          | discussing what happened, or anticipating the actions they remembered or had seen at
blank         | 
text          | prior viewings. At the time of data collection, the girls were particularly interested in
blank         | 
text          | watching the video of Amanda’s preschool graduation. During one visit, Amanda asked
blank         | 
text          | eagerly if she and Susi could watch the graduation video. Natalia connected the family’s
blank         | 
text          | video camera to their large television, scrolled through videos of several events and
blank         | 
text          | started the graduation video, which began with the students emerging one by one to form
blank         | 
text          | a line facing the audience while the song “Over the Rainbow” played. “¡Es mi
blank         | 
text          | graduación!,” Amanda announced proudly (“It’s my graduation!”). Amanda and Susi
blank         | 
text          | both called out in excitement when Amanda joined the group. “Allí estoy yo!” (“There I
blank         | 
text          | am!”) Amanda exclaimed. In the video, Amanda wore her long hair curled and violet
blank         | 
text          | and cream dress with a sash, as well as cap and gown. Amanda applauded as each name
blank         | 
text          | was read and the teacher announced what each child wanted to be when he/she grew up.
blank         | 
text          | The children sang several songs in English, Spanish and Chinese including “Hello, how
blank         | 
text          | are you,” “Un elefante se balanceaba” and others.

text          | Although the girls were not creating their own videos at that point, their parents’ video

title         | Chapter Conclusion
blank         | 
text          |            The data shared in this chapter support the major findings in the present study that
blank         | 
text          | all families used media content in both Spanish and English and parents felt this content
blank         | 
text          | contributed positively to their children’s (and sometimes their own) acquisition of
blank         | 
text          | English. Section I shows the diversity of programs (both TV/video and interactive) that
blank         | 
text          | families used, providing a sense of the breadth and nature of Spanish and English
blank         | 
text          | language that was present in homes via these sources, most often in spoken form through
blank         | 
text          | soundtracks of television and video but also via onscreen text. Section II shows the

text          | examples from both qualitative and quantitative data that show parents’ perception of
blank         | 
text          | media for learning – both English-language media for learning English as well as content
blank         | 
text          | in general (either or both languages) for learning reading and/or vocabulary skills and for
blank         | 
text          | inspiring learning-related activities such as talking or singing along with media, asking
blank         | 
text          | questions based on its contents, and teaching parents new information from what they
blank         | 
text          | have learned.
blank         | 
text          |            Finally, this chapter also highlights the finding that families did not only
blank         | 
text          | consume media content– they also produced it. Naomi and Eduardo Aguirres’ example
blank         | 
text          | of media production practices show ways that child-produced media can also elicit rich
blank         | 
text          | language production from children. Recording family videos, which was a popular
blank         | 
text          | activity across the case sample, also provided avenues for children to connect to
blank         | 
text          | meaningful moments and learning they experienced in the past.
blank         | 
text          |        From these data, it is clear that families’ media routines were diverse and rich in
blank         | 
text          | language and literacy experiences that included input of oral language in English, at least
blank         | 
text          | some of which was comprehensible as children were able to interact with it in various
blank         | 
text          | ways and discuss it with parents. Most families used a broader range of television and
blank         | 
text          | video content than interactive content, and the television and video content was more
blank         | 
text          | likely to be explicitly educational in nature. In general, parents also appeared to perceive
blank         | 
text          | greater learning from television and video content than from the interactive content their
blank         | 
text          | children used. As discussed further in Chapter Eight, these examples suggest that family
blank         | 
text          | media practices may contribute significantly to home language and literacy experiences
blank         | 
text          | and merit further study, both to understand their value as-is and to identify opportunities
blank         | 
text          | to strengthen families’ learning with these resources.

blank         | 
title         | FAMILIES’ SOCIAL NETWORKS
              | AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON MEDIA PRACTICES
blank         | 
text          |        This chapter focuses on the ways in which social influences and interactions with
blank         | 
text          | people in families’ larger networks shaped families’ media routines, including the
blank         | 
text          | language- and literacy-related experiences that were part of these routines. This chapter
blank         | 
text          | focuses on the major finding that interactions with extended family members, friends and
blank         | 
text          | larger social networks were important motivators for using media, as well as sources for
blank         | 
text          | finding and choosing media. As in Chapters Four and Five, the main focus here is on
blank         | 
text          | families’ media practices that were established prior to the iPad intervention although one
blank         | 
text          | example refers to the way in which a family exc.
blank         | 
text          |        The research questions for this study (pre-iPad) ask specifically what media
blank         | 
text          | activities were part of families’ media routines as well as what language and literacy
blank         | 
text          | experiences families’ media activities provided. As part of characterizing these aspects
blank         | 
text          | of the family media ecology, it is important to highlight the motivators and influences
blank         | 
text          | that emerged from the data, that helped shape and determine the media content and tools
blank         | 
text          | families chose and the ways they engaged with it. This chapter focuses on two main
blank         | 
text          | themes:
blank         | 
              | 
text          | I.     Social influences were important in determining content children wanted to
              |        engage with. Characters, programs, games and activities that were popular with
              |        peers in the extended family or at school.
blank         | 
text          | II.    Staying connected with the country of origin was an important role that
              |        media played for all families. This theme was documented both in the form of
              |        direct communications with people (calls, videoconferences, text messaging,
              |        social media) and in the form of media from parents’ country of origin (videos,
              |        television shows).

text          | The two sections that follow explore each of these topics based on interview, observation
blank         | 
text          | and in some cases also quantitative survey data. Examples in this chapter were identified
blank         | 
text          | via the “media for communication” code as well the: “local support network” and related
blank         | 
text          | subcodes including “local support network brokering/introducing technology” that
blank         | 
text          | emerged during the coding process.

text          | I. Local support networks as brokers of language and media activities
blank         | 
text          |        An important aspect to determine in understanding families’ media experiences is
blank         | 
text          | how they learn about and choose media technologies and content (the devices they buy
blank         | 
text          | and what programs they choose to use on those devices). Parent descriptions of
blank         | 
text          | children’s media interests reveals the closely intertwined nature of children’s social
blank         | 
text          | networks, the language of their peers and interests in particular media programs. In the
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | their eight-year-old daughter Naomi and six-year-old son Eduardo had shifted from
blank         | 
text          | choosing media content primarily in Spanish, to content primarily in English when
blank         | 
text          | Naomi was in second grade. As Eduardo explained, “At the beginning, before Naomi
blank         | 
text          | went into second grade, everything she watched was in Spanish, most of the programs
blank         | 
text          | were in Spanish. But now Naomi, because before she spoke… now she speaks more
blank         | 
text          | English, she’s starting to watch more programs in English, and her brother too.”14

text          |                                                      According to Lorena and Eduardo, in addition to Naomi’s developing English
blank         | 
text          | comprehension, their children’s slightly older cousin Carlos was a major influence on the
blank         | 
text          | children’s media choices and the shift toward English-language content. Carlos comes to
blank         | 
text          | the Aguirre family home at least one afternoon a week after school, until his parents
blank         | 
text          | finish work and come pick him up. Although Carlos speaks some Spanish at home,
blank         | 
text          | Lorena and Eduardo describe Carlos as English-dominant; he attends a monolingual
blank         |

text          |        Parents in four of the seven case families described how their children became
blank         | 
text          | familiar with specific English-language media programs via other children in their
blank         | 
text          | extended family (most of them slightly older). This was particularly salient for six-year-
blank         | 
text          | old Estela Morales, who spent time with her seven- and nine-year-old cousins regularly
blank         | 
text          | on weekends. The two families were close; Estela’s mother Sara originally came to the
blank         | 
text          | U.S. to live with her brother and help care for her nephew when he was a baby. After
blank         | 
text          | meeting Manuel and having Estela, Sara maintained her relationship with her brother,
blank         | 
text          | sister-in-law, nephew and niece. Estela developed close ties to her seven- and nine-year-
blank         | 
text          | old cousins, and as she had no siblings they were the closest peers she had in the family.
blank         | 
text          | This relationship was particularly influential in Estela’s language and media exposure
blank         | 
text          | because Estela’s cousins and their mother spoke primarily English at home and the media
blank         | 
text          | that her cousins tended to watch or play with on their iPad was also in English.

text          | weekend prior, and which Sara did not realize had been loaded onto her own device. In

text          | this example, not only were the local relatives influential in introducing Estela to

text          |         This chapter (and indeed this study) would not be complete without discussing the

text          | vital importance of media for connecting with loved ones, particularly in the cases of
blank         | 
text          | these immigrant families. When asked directly “What is the role of electronic media in
blank         | 
text          | your everyday life?,” parents in the sample of case families were quick to name
blank         | 
text          | communicating with loved ones abroad as a primary value media provides. All parents
blank         | 
text          | participating in this study immigrated to the U.S. as adults, leaving behind their parents
blank         | 
text          | and most or all of their immediate and extended family members. None of these adults
blank         | 
text          | were able to travel to their native countries to visit; in doing so they would risk being

blank         | 
text          | echoed in many ways Morley’s (2000) observation that “…new technologies […] not

text          | only disrupt national boundaries as containers of cultural experience. They also help to

text          | constitute new, transnational spaces of experience” (p. 168).

text          |                   For the seven case families, media offered a window into parents’ countries of
blank         | 
text          | origin, into the lives of loved ones and the culture where they were raised. Using these
blank         | 
text          | tools, children born in the U.S. met and interacted with their grandparents and extended

text          | families abroad. For those parents who had left children behind in their native countries,

text          | media offered the only lifeline of connection with these sons and daughters and the

text          | Skype, Live (videoconferencing), Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp (text messages),
blank         | 
text          | Viber and other programs, media provided parents with ways of connecting with artifacts
blank         | 
text          | from their native countries. Adults living in the U.S. had grown up with a variety of
blank         | 
text          | television programs and movies in their countries of origin that were part of their
blank         | 
text          | upbringing and culture. Spanish language media channels in the U.S. such as Univisión
blank         | 
text          | and Telemundo showed some shows imported from abroad such as certain telenovelas
blank         | 
text          | and the popular sit com El Chavo del Ocho, which was a favorite among most families in

text          | cultures and provided were artifacts of that culture they could share with their children.
blank         | 
text          |        Programs broadcast from parents’ countries of origin (Mexico, El Salvador, Perú
blank         | 
text          | and Nicaragua) also offered information about the social and political climate in those
blank         | 
text          | countries, which affected their family members and which, as some parents argued, their
blank         | 
text          | relatives may not share with them. Media channels that parents accessed from their
blank         | 
text          | countries of origin included television stations, online videos of television shows, songs,
blank         | 
text          | recipes and movies, radio stations and Internet sites for news, entertainment or practical
blank         | 
text          | information. The Orozcos, who were particularly concerned about their children in El
blank         | 
text          | Salvador, felt that Salvadoran news provided them with a more “objective” view on what
blank         | 
text          | was happening in the country; including information that they feared their family
blank         | 
text          | members would not report to them for fear of making them anxious.

title         | Chapter Conclusion
blank         | 
text          |        This chapter shares examples of how families’ larger social networks were
blank         | 
text          | influential both in motivating families’ media use to begin with, and in shaping the ways
blank         | 
text          | families chose media content or tools. The differences in survey responses between
blank         | 
text          | parents from primarily Spanish-speaking homes and those from primarily English
blank         | 
text          | speaking homes reveal a greater reliance on the social network among the former. This
blank         | 
text          | finding highlights one of the ways that language (also an indicator of generation status)
blank         | 
text          | may be related to social and cultural ways of finding resources. Although word of mouth
blank         | 
text          | may be a common strategy among parents from various backgrounds, the qualitative
blank         | 
text          | examples shared also show how in this particular group of minority language families,
blank         |

              | 	  
text          | these social influences may also shift children’s exposure to the dominant language and
blank         | 
text          | mainstream culture.
blank         | 
text          |        The data in this chapter also prompts the question: what affordances did staying
blank         | 
text          | connected to countries of origin through media activities provide to families in terms of
blank         | 
text          | language and literacy experiences? In all of these activities – direct interactions with
blank         | 
text          | relatives, using social media or accessing programs from their native countries – families
blank         | 
text          | maintained a direct and personal link to their countries of origin in ways that were not
blank         | 
text          | possible fifteen or twenty years earlier. Families communicated using text, photos, video
blank         | 
text          | clips, and calls (voice only or with video). In prior decades, letter writing with family
blank         | 
text          | members was a literacy-related activity common in immigrant family homes that could
blank         | 
text          | be used to make connections with literacy learning in school. The data presented in this
blank         | 
text          | chapter regarding how families communicate with technologies today, what kinds of
blank         | 
text          | links might be made between language and literacy learning and these modes of
blank         | 
text          | transnational connection?
blank         | 
text          |        Technology-facilitated interpersonal communication and particularly social media
blank         | 
text          | were used by all parents in the study and are growing rapidly among the Spanish-
blank         | 
text          | speaking Hispanic-Latino population in general. There are certainly opportunities for
blank         | 
text          | language and literacy experiences to occur via the text and oral language involved in
blank         | 
text          | these exchanges. As an example, I observed one child, Estela Morales, perusing her
blank         | 
text          | mother’s Facebook feed, pointing out the various family members and friends she
blank         | 
text          | recognized in the photos. However in Sara’s feed, as in many of the parents’, there were
blank         | 
text          | also images posted with bible quotes or other inspirational texts (in Spanish), which
blank         | 
text          | Estela read, sounding out the letters as she went. Although I did not observe this activity

text          | in other instances or with other families, it raised the question of whether and how social
blank         | 
text          | media could be harnessed to build language or literacy skills for children. The ubiquity
blank         | 
text          | of smartphones within this sample is consistent with the recent Pew Hispanic survey
blank         | 
text          | report (Lopez, Gonzalez-Barrera & Patten, 2013) that found a sharp increase in the
blank         | 
text          | number of foreign-born Hispanic-Latinos and Spanish-speaking Hispanic-Latinos who
blank         | 
text          | use the Internet as compared to three years prior (wherein Internet use among these
blank         | 
text          | groups rose 18 and 27 percentage points, respectively).
blank         | 
text          |            This information is important for educators to take into consideration when
blank         | 
text          | designing activities and interventions for parents. As access to Internet-connected
blank         | 
text          | devices spreads and families utilize these tools to interact, how might social media
blank         | 
text          | become a vehicle for creating home-school connections? In what ways might schools or
blank         | 
text          | other learning environments establish connections to the home via parents’ (or older
blank         | 
text          | children’s) transnational or local social media use? Some interventions have begun to
blank         | 
text          | explore the potential of text messaging to support home literacy practices and shown
blank         | 
text          | success, at least in self-report data (e.g. Revelle, Reardon, Green, Betancourt & Kotler,
blank         | 
text          | 2007). Efforts for building stronger links between learning at home and in school, for
blank         | 
text          | parent involvement and parent education may find new solutions by looking at how
blank         | 
text          | media might support them.

title         | ALGO DIFERENTE: THE ROLE OF A NEWLY INTRODUCED TABLET
blank         | 
              | 
text          |         This chapter focuses on the study’s third and final research question: What family
blank         | 
text          | dynamics and practices develop around a newly introduced tablet device loaded with a
blank         | 
text          | set of high quality literacy and language resources? As detailed in Chapter Two, at the
blank         | 
text          | mid-point in the six-month data collection period, each case family was given an Apple
blank         | 
text          | iPad that was theirs to keep and was loaded with a selection of educational programs,
blank         | 
text          | most of them language- and literacy-related in some respect (see Chapter Two for the full
blank         | 
text          | list of apps provided and app curation approach). In these case studies, the baseline data
blank         | 
text          | collected over the first three months of visits provide a look at what is. The latter three
blank         | 
text          | months, when families had received their iPads, offered the chance to ask what if?. If
blank         | 
text          | families have unlimited access to a device loaded with educational programs, what would
blank         | 
text          | engage them? The major findings supported and discussed in this chapter were:
blank         | 
text          | 1. The impact of iPads was highly linked to the content installed on them.
blank         | 
text          | 2. The new content led to some new language- and literacy-related media practices
blank         | 
text          |        including child-led, interest-driven learning.
blank         | 
text          | 3. Families also used the iPads for previously established media activities.
blank         | 
text          |         In this analysis, I focus on child, parent and joint practices that relate to language
blank         | 
text          | and literacy learning. What kinds of experiences or activities with spoken or written
blank         | 
text          | language did families engage in using the iPads, and how do these differ from their
blank         | 
text          | former media activities? Who appeared to make most use of the iPad and why? Because
blank         | 
text          | the intervention involved introducing both a new device and new content I address the
blank         | 
text          | new opportunities and possible disadvantages both of these aspects introduced. Close

text          | analysis of the qualitative data, supported by the quantitative reports from AppStat and
blank         | 
text          | some reports generated by the Reading Rainbow app led to the following main findings:
blank         | 
              | 
text          | I.     The content provided was new to families and led to some new opportunities
              |        for language- and literacy-related practices. There was a clear qualitative
              |        difference between the mobile content that children, and to some extent parents,
              |        had been using prior to the study and the programs provided on their iPads. These
              |        programs in turn afforded several different practices with media that families had
              |        not engaged in before. Two categories of content that elicited the most significant
              |        opportunities for language and literacy experiences, I argue, were ebooks and
              |        creative storytelling apps. The data yielded examples of child-led, interest-driven
              |        learning using these resources.
blank         | 
text          | II.    Features of the iPad device itself offered some new experiences. In some cases,
              |        the iPad allowed for more joint media engagement because of the size of the
              |        screen. The keypad was easier for children to type on than smartphone keypads.
              |        It also diverted attention away from other media activities such as watching
              |        television or playing with smartphones. As for disadvantages, some parents
              |        reported that at times children wanted to use the iPad for more time than parents
              |        allotted, or that younger siblings struggled with sharing the iPad or taking turns.
blank         | 
text          | III.   The iPads distributed were viewed by families as primarily the child’s device.
              |        Parents used iPads but often when children were at school or asleep; when
              |        children were present, parents made their use a priority. Some parents also
              |        preferred continuing to use their phones due to habit and portability.
blank         | 
text          | IV.    Family members transferred their existing routines of media activity to the
              |        iPad, using it to watch or play the types of content they had engaged with
              |        before. Though the new content encouraged some new practices, old practices
              |        also persisted as family members already had preconceived expectations of what
              |        they would do with the tablet based on their activities with other devices.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Based on these findings, shared in detail in the sections below, I argue that the iPad
blank         | 
text          | intervention allowed for some new language- and literacy-related media practices to
blank         | 
text          | emerge, and that these practices are worthy of our attention as they identify opportunities
blank         | 
text          | for design and future research on learning outcomes. At the same time, the iPads also
blank         | 
text          | acted as a new vehicle for many of the same media activities that families had engaged in
blank         | 
text          | in the past, and this merits attention as well because it informs how we think about when
blank         | 
              | 
              |

              | 	  
text          | and how media use habits develop, and how difficult these may be to alter once they are
blank         | 
text          | established.
blank         | 
text          |        The sections below follow a different sequence than the list above; they first share
blank         | 
text          | the basic information of how families initially received their iPads, which family
blank         | 
text          | members used the iPad and an overview of how much iPads were used. These are
blank         | 
text          | followed by findings related to language and literacy experiences on the iPad, focusing
blank         | 
text          | on the two focal categories that emerged as particularly disruptive in terms of family
blank         | 
text          | media routines: ebooks and creative production.
blank         | 
text          |        Why focus on ebooks and storytelling tools among all of the genres of apps
blank         | 
text          | installed on families’ iPads? As described in the section “What family dynamics and
blank         | 
text          | media practices arose in relationship to the new content?,” the overwhelming amount of
blank         | 
text          | data generated through the combination of quantitative (AppStat logs) and qualitative
blank         | 
text          | sources (observations, parent interviews and ABI interviews) made it necessary to select
blank         | 
text          | focal areas for analysis at this stage. In order to do so, I used the AppStat logs to identify
blank         | 
text          | which “genres” of provided iPad apps families used the most. From the three top
blank         | 
text          | categories, I chose two – ebooks and creative storytelling tools – for closer examination
blank         | 
text          | due to their richness in terms of activities within each genre. By richness I mean that for
blank         | 
text          | example, ebook use encompasses a variety of content, difficulty levels and potential uses;
blank         | 
text          | storytelling tools provide a structure for storytelling but are open-ended and can lead to
blank         | 
text          | any number of different outcomes depending on the user’s interest, imagination and skill.
blank         | 
text          | In addition, as a robust literature on app use does not yet exist, from a theoretical
blank         | 
text          | standpoint analysis of these activities allows for links to literature on storybook reading
blank         |

text          | and storytelling, activities that share features across more traditional and electronic or
blank         | 
text          | digital forms.
blank         | 
text          |        The third app genre among the most-used provided apps, not discussed in detail
blank         | 
text          | here, was the genre of phonics apps. These programs were particularly popular with the
blank         | 
text          | two families that had very young children (two and three years old) in addition to the
blank         | 
text          | five- or seven-year old, although they were also used to varying degrees by the other
blank         | 
text          | families as well. The activities children engaged in via the phonics apps involved
blank         | 
text          | different configurations of dragging letters to form words, selecting words that matched
blank         | 
text          | audible letter sounds, tracing letters, and in the case of Endless Alphabet, viewing short
blank         | 
text          | animations that illustrated word definitions (with definitions read aloud). Doubtless, the
blank         | 
text          | phonics app data merits further analysis and discussion in future work as well.

text          | I. How did families initially receive their iPads?
blank         | 
text          |         Families and particularly children all received their iPads with joy and excitement.
blank         | 
text          | Even for the Aguirre family (the one family that already had an iPad) seeing and playing
blank         | 
text          | with the new apps I had installed was very engaging for the children. As described in
blank         | 
text          | Chapter Two, when iPads were distributed I dedicated the session to explaining how to
blank         | 
text          | use the devices in general, how to manage the account linked to the iPad, how to obtain
blank         | 
text          | credit for use on the AppStore and the basic functions of many of the apps installed.
blank         | 
text          | Children were all very eager to use the apps, and I let them experiment for a minute or
blank         | 
text          | two with each one that I explained. In each home there were several moments where
blank         | 
text          | children wanted to continue playing with each app they sampled, rather than close it and
blank         | 
text          | continue on to the next one. For every family, I had taken note previously of child

blank         | 
text          | those interests and their ages, in addition to the “core” group of apps I had chosen for all
blank         | 
text          | families. The core group of apps I installed also included ones that I anticipated adults
blank         | 
text          | might be interested in using, including Facebook, Skype, YouTube and a selection of
blank         | 
text          | English language learning resources.

              | 
              | 
text          |            An important aspect of understanding what role iPads took on in family homes is
blank         | 
text          | the question of who was using the iPads primarily and how this was determined.
blank         | 
text          | Although iPads were presented as a device for the family, not specifically for the children,
blank         | 
text          | and I emphasized that they were for anyone in the family to use, many parents still
blank         | 
text          | viewed the iPads as being principally for their child(ren). It was not possible to track the
blank         | 
text          | usage time per individual user via the AppStats reports or the iPad itself, as iOS does not
blank         | 
text          | currently offer individual accounts for each user as do the operating systems on Apple

blank         | 
text          | who used the iPads and for what purposes. In addition to the final parent interview,
blank         | 
text          | AppStats acted as a basis for prompts – I inquired with parents and/or children about who
blank         | 
text          | used the apps (primarily the most-used apps in that time period as time did not allow for
blank         | 
text          | prompting about every app used).
blank         | 
text          |               Although some parents used the iPads more than others, in many cases the adults
blank         | 
text          | reported they either did not use the iPad, or used it only when children were sleeping or
blank         | 
text          | otherwise occupied. Other parents reported that their main use of the iPad was when they
blank         | 
text          | were engaged in a joint activity with their child. The iPads contained many applications
blank         | 
text          | adults used on their phones, as well as other applications I had installed for them to use
blank         | 
text          | such as Duolingo, Wlingua and other English learning apps targeted at adults. However,
blank         | 
text          | a number of factors contributed to children becoming the primary users of the iPads.
blank         | 
text          |          First, the parents in this case sample had other devices they used. All parents
blank         | 
text          | participating in this study did own smartphones17 and were accustomed to using them for
blank         | 
text          | a variety of purposes. While one could argue that parents’ experience with smartphones
blank         | 
text          | may have prepared them to be more comfortable using iPads, due to the a similar
blank         | 
text          | touchscreen interface and many of the same apps, it also meant that they already had
blank         | 
text          | established media routines with the phones, which can serve many of the same functions
blank         | 
text          | as the iPad in a more portable package. The apps that most parents used, such as
blank         | 
text          | Facebook, translator apps, Pandora, YouTube, web browsers and others were common to
blank         | 
text          | both Android and iOS devices. For those parents who had iPhones (Lorena and Eduardo
blank         |

text          | using the iPad, several parents described how they used it infrequently because they were
blank         | 
text          | already used to using their cell phones, which were smaller and more portable and thus
blank         | 
text          | easier to have on hand for any situation. There were specific situations where parents
blank         | 
text          | found it particularly useful to use the iPad instead. Using translator apps was one such
blank         | 
text          | situation. Lorena Aguirre and Natalia Acosta, some of the most frequent users of
blank         | 
text          | translator apps, both reported that they preferred the larger screen for entering text and
blank         | 
text          | reading translations. As Rebeca mentions in her quote, she enjoyed using the iPad for
blank         | 
text          | recipes, also due to the larger screen that she could prop up (using the provided case) and
blank         | 
text          | reference more easily than the phone while cooking. Several of the parents also used
blank         | 
text          | Facebook on the iPad, although often when the children were asleep or busy with
blank         | 
text          | something else. In the Morales household, the only one without any kind of Internet
blank         | 
text          | connection for the iPad, Sara and Manuel preferred using their phones in part because
blank         | 
text          | they could access the Internet with them. The Acosta family and the Orozco family
blank         | 
text          | particularly enjoyed using the video camera on the iPad for documenting family outings.
blank         | 
text          | Natalia reported that they usually used their camcorder for recording entire events such as
blank         | 
text          | parties or graduations, but with the iPad they had engaged in recording shorter videos in
blank         | 
text          | situations where they would not have taken the camcorder.
blank         | 
text          |        Additionally, it is possible that parents were not particularly drawn to the apps for
blank         | 
text          | adults that I had installed. Many of the apps targeted at adults, including the English
blank         | 
text          | learning apps such as Duolingo, required an Internet connection to run or at least to create

blank         | 
text          | steps, or an Internet connection, to perform their basic functions (with Reading Rainbow
blank         | 
text          | as the major exception). Certainly, for the two families who did not have high-speed
blank         | 
text          | Internet, the requirement to be online during use was a roadblock. During the first month
blank         | 
text          | of the iPad intervention Sara Morales, the only parent who did not have either high-speed
blank         | 
text          | Internet or a hot spot via mobile device, became interested in using the iPad to improve
blank         | 
text          | her English and spent more than eight hours using the Wlingua Vocabulary app, the only
blank         | 
text          | adult English learning app that did not require a connection and account creation. Sara
blank         | 
text          | was interested in trying the other English apps, but unfortunately could not do so at home
blank         | 
text          | due to the family’s lack of Internet service.18 After the first month, Sara stopped using
blank         | 
text          | Wlingua Vocabulary, citing lack of time. Natalia and Miguel Acosta, although they did
blank         | 
text          | not have high-speed Internet, used their smartphone mobile hotspot to use Facebook,
blank         | 
text          | translator apps, Pandora and others that required a connection. It is difficult to determine
blank         | 
text          | precisely whether parents who had wireless Internet were deterred from using the English
blank         | 
text          | learning apps because of the added steps like creating an account, entering an email
blank         | 
text          | address and password, but it is certainly a possibility.
blank         | 
text          |                           There are other reasons that parents did not explicitly describe but that one might
blank         | 
text          | speculate about, regarding why children were the primary users of the iPads. In Rebeca’s
blank         | 
text          | comment at the start of this section, she uses the phrase “segun es para ellas” (since it’s
blank         | 
text          | for them). This phrasing suggests she saw the iPad as something that was given to her
blank         | 
text          | daughters and not her, despite my emphasis on it being a family resource when families
blank         | 
text          | were recruited and when they received their iPads. Other parents may have also felt that

text          | the iPads were supposed to be used mainly by the children as well, perhaps in part due to
blank         | 
text          | their awareness that the study was in the field of education and an assumption that the
blank         | 
text          | focus was on children. The large number of children’s apps that were installed and which
blank         | 
text          | I explained to families during the iPad introductory session may have also cast the iPad
blank         | 
text          | as a resource for the children. Finally, some parents were less experienced with
blank         | 
text          | technology and may have felt timid or not entirely confident about “tinkering” with the
blank         | 
text          | iPads. For example, in her initial interview Carmen Orozco described how one time she
blank         | 
text          | had used the family laptop and somehow blocked access to it or caused it to freeze such
blank         | 
text          | that they had to seek professional support in order to fix. From that point on, she had not
blank         | 
text          | used the laptop much on her own for fear of breaking it.

text          |                                        The iPads were also loaded with a variety of apps for children and all children used
blank         | 
text          | them regularly, and some children used particular apps with their parents. In some cases,
blank         | 
text          | parents used the iPads for learning purposes by themselves, as in Érica’s examples of
blank         | 
text          | using pronunciation videos on YouTube after the children had gone to bed (shared in
blank         | 
text          | Chapter Four). Weekly usage times on the iPads using the provided apps varied widely
blank         | 
text          | within and across families, from as little as 65 minutes in the entire two week period, to
blank         | 
text          | over 50 hours. Table 7a shows categories of provided apps (besides video and web
blank         |

text          |              Parents reported, and weekly observations confirmed, that iPads were used in lieu
blank         | 
text          | of many of the devices that children had used before. For example, Jessica and Yelitza
blank         | 
text          | Rivera had been using smartphones as their primary platform for media activities, often
blank         | 
text          | watching YouTube or playing with apps. After they received the iPad, they mainly used
blank         | 
text          | the iPad for these purposes (using a combination of the apps provided and ones they
blank         | 
text          | downloaded themselves). Before the iPad intervention, Saúl Jr. and David Martínez
blank         | 
text          | frequently used the family laptop to play action-based games such as Halo, and they also
blank         | 
text          | watched television. When their family received the iPad, the boys began to use it instead
blank         | 
text          | of the laptop and Érica reported that they watched “much less” television. It is interesting
blank         | 
text          | to note that, in the case of the Martínez family, when the boys abandoned the laptop in
blank         | 
text          | favor of the iPad, their father began to use the laptop in a way that he had never done
blank         | 
text          | before when the boys occupied it for game play. Saúl Sr. began using the laptop regularly

text          |        Table 7b shows the video and web search apps (not shown in Table 7a). The
blank         | 
text          | table shows the variability among families particularly with respect to time using
blank         | 
text          | YouTube – ranging from zero hours to nearly 400 hours. Families used the YouTube app
blank         | 
text          | for myriad purposes, from researching recipes to listening to music. However, there are
blank         | 
text          | large differences between families, particularly between the families who did not have
blank         | 
text          | high-speed Internet (Acosta and Morales) and those who did. In addition, in the Aguirre
blank         | 
text          | family, parents Eduardo and Lorena deleted the YouTube app (note time of zero minutes
blank         | 
text          | although the family did have high-speed wireless Internet). The children did watch videos
blank         | 
text          | regularly using the YouTube website on the Safari app. Tracking the specific uses of the
blank         | 
text          | YouTube app presented a methodological challenge, particularly for families that used it
blank         | 
text          | extensively. For example, for the families with the most YouTube use, some of the usage
blank         | 
text          | time was for listening to music, and thus it is difficult to determine how much was
blank         | 
text          | actually “screen time.” Also, although I prompted families about what content they
blank         | 
text          | accessed on YouTube, families did not necessarily remember every video they had
blank         | 
text          | watched and the reports were unlikely to be exhaustive. Thus, I can determine the
blank         | 
text          | amount of time families spent using YouTube and the YouTube content that families
blank         | 
text          | remembered using, but not all content potentially played. In addition, the availability of
blank         | 
text          | other devices in the family may have had some relationship to time spent on YouTube.
blank         | 
text          | For example, the Rivera family – who spent by far the most time with YouTube – had
blank         | 
text          | removed their television prior to the iPad intervention, and thus YouTube in effect took
blank         | 
text          | on the role that televisions may have played in other households. In other words, while

text          |           In response to the trend of children using the iPad in lieu of other devices such as
blank         | 
text          |   television, smartphones or computer, I specifically probed parents about whether they felt
blank         | 
text          |   their child was spending more, less or equal time with screen media after receiving the
blank         | 
text          |   iPads. In response, all parents reported that they did not feel their children’s screen time
blank         | 
text          |   had increased or decreased; in their assessment, children replaced other types of media
blank         | 
text          |   activities such as watching television or playing games on the computer with using iPad
blank         | 
text          |   apps or watching videos there. From an observational perspective, it was difficult to
blank         | 
text          |   ascertain the validity of parent reports, as children were largely occupied with screen
blank         | 
text          |   media activities during visits – both before and after they received their iPads.
blank         | 
text          |   Observations did confirm that once children received their iPads, they often used the
blank         | 
text          |   iPads rather than the other devices, and AppStat data confirmed that families used the
blank         | 
text          |   iPads not only during visits but also at regular points in between. Sometimes, children
blank         | 
text          |   were using iPads for the same activities they engaged in before, such as watching

text          | I had provided or that they had downloaded.

text          | IV. What family dynamics and media practices arose in relationship to the new
              | content?
blank         | 
text          |            The previous sections reveal that the primary users of the iPads distributed
blank         | 
text          | were the children. Children (as well as parents in some cases, to a lesser extent) spent
blank         | 
text          | regular and considerable amounts of time using the iPads. Given this finding, what new
blank         | 
text          | practices (if any) did they engage in using the iPads that were not already part of their
blank         | 
text          | media routine before? The particular content that children now had available to them via
blank         | 
text          | the pre-loaded iPads was qualitatively different from the types of interactive programs
blank         | 
text          | they had used prior to the study. In Chapter Five, Table 5c describes the interactive
blank         | 
text          | content children in the study used, as described by parents in interviews and observed
blank         | 
text          | during the first three months of observations. Comparing this set of programs with the
blank         | 
text          | list of apps families received on the iPads reveals a stark contrast. First, the vast majority
blank         | 
text          | of apps that children used prior to the iPad intervention were not what would be
blank         | 
text          | considered “educational.” Although there is a growing literature on video games and
blank         | 
text          | learning, and some might argue that children learn from playing Mario Brothers, Halo or
blank         | 
text          | Skylander, these programs were not designed based on specific learning goals or
blank         | 
text          | curricula. In contrast, most of the apps I provided were educational in nature. The
blank         | 
text          | provided apps also may have offered a broader variety of different genres and activities.
blank         | 
text          | For example, prior to receiving the iPad, David and Saúl Martínez played many different

text          | games but they were largely action/adventure games. With the iPad they now had access
blank         | 
text          | to apps that included ebooks, phonics apps, creative storytelling tools, artmaking apps, an
blank         | 
text          | interactive atlas, and so forth. This diversity of different activities was not present in any
blank         | 
text          | family’s prior collection of apps or other interactive media.
blank         | 
text          |                             Some of the general tools contained on the iPad were already familiar to
blank         | 
text          | families. These included YouTube, translator apps such as Google Translate, and web
blank         | 
text          | browsers (Safari), as well as social media applications such as Facebook and Skype.
blank         | 
text          | These programs were already included in families’ repertoires with smartphones and/or
blank         | 
text          | computers prior to their receiving their iPads. PBSKids shows were already popular
blank         | 
text          | among families, although they had accessed them before only on television or in one case
blank         | 
text          | via web site, not via the mobile app. Most of the educational apps provided with the iPad,
blank         | 
text          | however, including ebooks, phonics games, children’s atlas, or creative tools were
blank         | 
text          | completely new to families. One exception was Wlingua (an adult English learning app),
blank         | 
text          | that Érica Martínez had used before on her phone. In sum, a large portion of the apps I
blank         | 
text          | provided were quite different from those that families had owned and used previously.
blank         | 
text          | Due to the difference in much of the content that children accessed on their new iPads,
blank         | 
text          | different media activities emerged.
blank         | 
text          |               Families’ activities with iPads and individual apps were many and varied, and I
blank         | 
text          | have imposed a particular focus in order to create a feasible scope for discussion, as
blank         | 
text          | follows. Table 6c shows categories of provided apps used per family (note that it does
blank         | 
text          | not include apps that families downloaded of their own choice).20 As shown, the three

blank         | 
text          | there were some families for whom other categories had more usage time, for example
blank         | 
text          | Brandon Orozco used the geography and nature apps for more time than creative
blank         | 
text          | storytelling tools. The Acosta family used translator apps the most, however this
blank         | 
text          | appeared to by exclusively adult use. Ebooks, phonics apps and creative storytelling
blank         | 
text          | tools were the only categories that all families used fairly extensively (3.5 hours or more)
blank         | 
text          | and for six of the seven families they were the app genres most used by the children.

text          | the data, and as described earlier in this chapter it was necessary to develop a particular
blank         | 
text          | focus for the present analysis. Much data remains for discussion in future works
blank         | 
text          | including that related to the phonics apps, which factored among the three most-used
blank         | 
text          | categories due in part to use by the Acosta and Rivera families, who in addition to early

text          | focus the analysis that follows on two of the three main categories of media activities
blank         | 
text          | (besides video) that children engaged in using the iPads: ebooks and creative storytelling
blank         | 
text          | apps. These media activities were selected as focal points for the following criteria: they
blank         | 
text          | were relatively common across all families, and they both have potential implications for
blank         | 
text          | families’ language and literacy experience. It is useful to note that both ebook use and
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | shows use of these three genres in particular, by family. Consolidating findings into
blank         | 
text          | categories of use is important because of the constant challenge that faces us in research
blank         | 
text          | on technology use, namely that specific programs and platforms that people use advance
blank         | 
text          | and morph rapidly, at a much greater speed than most academic research can keep up
blank         | 
text          | with. As researchers of technology and learning, one of our challenges is to focus on
blank         | 
text          | functions that technology can provide, that might stand the test of time and the come-and-
blank         | 
text          | go of specific tools. My hope is that by focusing on activities that leverage technology
blank         | 
text          | such as e-reading or storytelling, rather than on individual tools, we have the potential to
blank         | 
text          | generate findings that may be more easily applied to future devices and programs.

blank         | 
text          | used ebooks occasionally via his school’s MyOn.com subscription (described in Chapter
blank         | 
text          | Four), and eight-year-old Naomi Aguirre had used one Pinkalicious read-aloud app in the
blank         | 
text          | past. Receiving the iPads brought a change in that regard, as all children in the study

blank         | 
text          | literacy-related activities that families engaged in most using the iPads and that appeared
blank         | 
text          | to invite the most co-engagement from parents. The AppStat logs show the Reading
blank         | 
text          | Rainbow app as the single most-used app among the ones I provided, other than YouTube
blank         | 
text          | which families used for a variety of purposes (watching videos, listening to music) and
blank         | 
text          | remained open for quite extended periods. Six out of the seven families used Reading
blank         | 
text          | Rainbow regularly, the exception being the Acosta family, whose method of connecting
blank         | 
text          | to the Internet (via smartphone “hotspot”) made it more cumbersome to use the app. The
blank         | 
text          | Morales family used Reading Rainbow although they did not have an Internet connection
blank         | 
text          | for their iPad at all. Estela was interested in the ebooks and downloaded new books at
blank         | 
text          | her cousins’ house. I also provided an Internet connection during my visits, using my
blank         | 
text          | own cell phone hotspot so that Estela could download new books once every two weeks
blank         | 
text          | if she desired. Table 7e shows the total time each family spent with the Reading

blank         |

blank         | 
text          | feature that the ebooks offered: the ebooks provided all featured a narration option,
blank         | 
text          | except for La Liebre y la Torguga. When families were observed using ebooks they
blank         | 
text          | always used the narration feature, so when they were reading ebooks, they were also
blank         | 
text          | hearing them read aloud. In contrast, “basic” ebooks, which do not offer narration, are
blank         | 
text          | more analogous to a print book experience and do not offer the opportunity to hear the
blank         | 
text          | text read aloud.
blank         | 
text          |            The ebook apps installed on the iPads included Reading Rainbow, a virtual
blank         | 
text          | library of hundreds of ebooks as well as some additional features such as educational
blank         | 
text          | videos, card matching games based on the content of books, and “stickers” awarded for
blank         | 
text          | books read in different categories. Reading Rainbow ebooks consist of illustrations, text,
blank         | 
text          | and a voice narration feature that reads the text aloud and highlights either passages or
blank         | 
text          | individual words as they are heard in the narration (highlighting style varies by book).
blank         | 
text          | The book illustrations also feature some simple animations that users can trigger by
blank         | 
text          | touching spots that sparkle on the screen. Although unfortunately it does not currently
blank         | 
text          | offer content in languages other than English, Reading Rainbow was by far the richest

blank         | 
text          | Books are organized on thematic “islands” such as “Action Adventures & Magical Tales”
blank         | 
text          | and “Animal Kingdom,” which featured many overlapping titles but roughly grouped
blank         | 
text          | books by areas of interest. The app allows users to download five books at a time, and

text          | mentioned in Chapter Two the availability of ebooks and other educational apps for the
blank         | 
text          | iPad was much broader for English materials than for Spanish. All families did receive
blank         | 
text          | the ebook La Gallina Roja, a bilingual, ebook with English and Spanish text and
blank         | 
text          | narration options, as well as the basic ebook (text/illustrations only) La liebre y la tortuga,
blank         | 
text          | in Spanish. The MeMe Tales app offered an additional selection of books to choose from,
blank         | 
text          | and which I installed because it offered a small selection of titles in Spanish in addition to
blank         | 
text          | the English language books. Of these limited Spanish ebook options, La Gallina Roja
blank         | 
text          | was used more than once by children in all families, and some spent extended amounts of
blank         | 
text          | time with it. I also installed ebooks as some of the “elective” apps I chose based on each
blank         | 
text          | child’s interests. For example, Bryanna Parra was fascinated by the Pixar movie Brave,
blank         |

text          | offerings available on the AppStore in July and August of 2013.

text          | Ebooks: interest-based exploration and link between home and school
blank         | 
text          |        In their model of interest development, Hidi and Renninger (2006) build on and
blank         | 
text          | synthesize prior research on interest to delineate four progressively deepening phases:
blank         | 
text          | triggered situational interest, maintained situational interest, emerging (less-developed)
blank         | 
text          | individual interest, and well-developed individual interest. Each of these phases marks a
blank         | 
text          | window in which it can progress toward the next phase if sufficiently maintained and
blank         | 
text          | nurtured. Through the case and research examples shared, Hidi and Renninger show how
blank         | 
text          | learner engagement can move across settings in building interest, and how different
blank         | 
text          | forms of support and information seeking can be essential.
blank         | 
text          |        From the standpoint of child interest, there are some logical reasons why ebooks
blank         | 
text          | and the Reading Rainbow app were particularly engaging for a group of children of
blank         | 
text          | different ages, genders and affinities. Unlike other apps, which may include various
blank         | 
text          | levels but focus on one primary theme or activity, Reading Rainbow offered access to
blank         | 
text          | thousands of books on a variety of topics, each with its own style of artwork and
blank         | 
text          | language, and connecting to many different topics of interest. The app allows users to
blank         | 
text          | download five books at a time to a personal “backpack,” and use them offline. When a
blank         | 
text          | book is returned, a space opens up for a new book to be downloaded. The large array of
blank         | 
text          | books allowed children in the study to make connections with their own interests,
blank         | 
              |

              |

              | 	  
text          | whereas other apps simply did not offer such a wide range of content choices (except for
blank         | 
text          | video channel apps like YouTube). In addition to the books themselves, Reading
blank         | 
text          | Rainbow also offers “video field trips” to places such as space shuttles and ocean liners
blank         | 
text          | and interactive games based on the content of books.22 In this way, Reading Rainbow
blank         | 
text          | offered more breadth of different experiences to keep children engaged over time, as
blank         | 
text          | opposed to apps that offered one specific type of activity such as phonics apps, the
blank         | 
text          | Barefoot World Atlas app or others with more limited offerings. Reading Rainbow also
blank         | 
text          | provided a range in terms of the reading levels and vocabulary, however as discussed in
blank         | 
text          | Chapter Four in relationship to Saúl Jr. and the MyOn.com virtual library, books with
blank         | 
text          | less complex text were often targeted at very young readers and there was not
blank         | 
text          | customizability of reading level within any of the ebook apps.
blank         | 
text          |                                        With this diverse content, curated for young children, Reading Rainbow was able to
blank         | 
text          | provide material that matched a wide range of interests. With the large selection of books
blank         | 
text          | available on Reading Rainbow, children were able to choose content that matched an
blank         | 
text          | interest or topic of curiosity that they may have developed in another setting, at school,
blank         | 
text          | with friends or in other media. Among these examples, several children chose to explore
blank         | 
text          | specific book titles that they seen and become interested in at school (which also
blank         | 
text          | happened to be on the app), and others chose books on topics they were currently
blank         | 
text          | learning about in school. For example, during one observation where Estela Morales was
blank         | 
text          | browsing Reading Rainbow for books to download, she came across a National
blank         | 
text          | Geographic Kids factual book about penguins and became excited. “We adopted a
blank         | 
text          | penguin!” she exclaimed, referring to an activity at school where the class had “adopted”

blank         | 
text          | to the descriptions of penguins’ biological features and special adaptations. In the month
blank         | 
text          | of October, several children downloaded Halloween-themed books. The Reading
blank         | 
text          | Rainbow app features a library of books from popular publishers, which children
blank         | 
text          | sometimes recognized as the same titles from their school classrooms or libraries. There
blank         | 
text          | was some evidence in the data that familiar content attracted children to reading
blank         | 
text          | particular titles. Sometimes children chose books that connected to topics children were
blank         | 
text          | learning about in school and also expanded on a personal interest, as seen in the two

blank         | 
text          | she wanted to become a scientist. Science was Jessica’s favorite subject in school, and
blank         | 
text          | she already turned to traditional books as a resource for expanding on her interest.
blank         | 
text          | Among the literacy-related activities she and her family engaged with outside of school,
blank         | 
text          | Jessica enjoyed checking out science-related books (in addition to others) from the library.

text          | instructions for home science experiments, such as making a volcano using baking soda,

text          | considerable amount of time. The total amount of time Jessica’s family spent using
blank         | 
text          | Reading Rainbow was 1,329 minutes (over 22 hours, or an average of 110 minutes per

blank         | 
text          |        First-grader Brandon Orozco, like most other children in the study, had not used
blank         | 
text          | ebooks at home or at school but used ebooks regularly on his iPad, mostly via the
blank         | 
text          | Reading Rainbow app. A link began to emerge between Brandon’s interest in history,
blank         | 
text          | introduced in Chapter Four, and some of the ebooks he accessed on Reading Rainbow. As
blank         | 
text          | described in Chapter Four, Brandon and his father had used YouTube several times to
blank         | 
text          | research prominent leaders in history that Brandon learned about in school, such as César
blank         | 
text          | Chávez and George Washington, and asked questions about at home. José Rubén used
blank         | 
text          | online video as a way of helping Brandon learn more about these figures, the details of
blank         | 
text          | their lives and even see them in action, as with Martin Luther King Jr. After the iPads
blank         | 
text          | were distributed, toward the end of the data collection period, Brandon discovered the
blank         | 
text          | David A. Adler’s Picture Book Biography Series of books on the Reading Rainbow e-
blank         | 
text          | library. The series, which also exists in print form, is made up of several individual
blank         | 
text          | illustrated life stories of Benjamin Franklin, Helen Keller, Martin Luther King, Jr. and
blank         | 
text          | others, some of whom Brandon had learned about in school. Using these books on
blank         | 
text          | Reading Rainbow at home, Brandon accessed another avenue to explore his interest in
blank         | 
text          | historical figures.
blank         | 
text          |        Brandon’s parents had already explained that Brandon’s interest in famous historical
blank         | 
text          | figures originated in school, and an additional link regarding the ebooks surfaced when
blank         | 
text          | Brandon was asked about why he had chosen to download the Benjamin Franklin
blank         | 
text          | picturebook. Brandon responded, “Porque la maestra tiene todos esos libros,” (Because
blank         | 
text          | my teacher has all these books), pointing to the five books in his Reading Rainbow
blank         | 
              |

blank         | 
text          | suggested that besides his interest in history and particularly famous people, the books
blank         | 
text          | had attracted him because they were from the same series his teacher had at a school and
blank         | 
text          | that he was already familiar with. Figure 7d shows the reading log of Brandon’s Reading
blank         | 
text          | Rainbow account, capturing his ebook activity with the app during the three months he
blank         | 
text          | had the iPad. Overall, Brandon spent 159.4 minutes with ebooks on the Reading
blank         | 
text          | Rainbow app, in addition to 135 minutes he spent browsing the books, doing the
blank         | 
text          | supplemental activities in Reading Rainbow (such as the video fieldtrips) and 164
blank         | 
text          | minutes with other eBooks provided on the iPad. In the last month of the study, he had
blank         | 
text          | downloaded five books from the series on historical figures. Unfortunately, because he
blank         | 
text          | downloaded the biography picturebooks near the end of the data collection (they were
blank         | 
text          | among the most recent of the 22 books Brandon accessed during the study, and his time
blank         | 
text          | reading these books totaled 27 per cent of his total reading time on the app), no further
blank         | 
text          | data is available on whether he sustained his interest in these books over a longer period
blank         | 
text          | of time.
blank         | 
text          |        In addition to the Reading Rainbow app, Brandon also used other ebook apps
blank         | 
text          | installed on the iPad and was the only child who downloaded an additional ebook app
blank         | 
text          | beyond the ones provided – the Disney Storytime app. Carmen explained that one day
blank         | 
text          | when a friend of Brandon’s was visiting them, the friend and his parent had brought their
blank         | 
text          | own iPad. The friend’s parent recommended Disney Storytime, which her child liked to
blank         | 
text          | use and which provides a selection of ebooks based on Disney (including Pixar) movies.
blank         | 
text          | The app itself is free, but in order to access most of the ebooks they need to be purchased
blank         | 
text          | in the app. What was perhaps more interesting to note is that the visiting parent and child

blank         | 
text          | so that the parent purchased it for their own iPad. This interaction showed an example of
blank         | 
text          | how a family’s media choices with the iPad were influenced by their local friends and
blank         | 
text          | family (as discussed in relation to the pre-iPad data in Chapter Five), but also of how the
blank         | 
text          | selection of apps on the pre-loaded iPad began to influence other families in their
blank         | 
text          | network.

text          |        To use Hidi and Renninger’s framework, Jessica and Brandon’s examples some
blank         | 
text          | ways that ebooks contributed to interest development by providing a venue for these
blank         | 
text          | learners to further explore topics that they may have had a “triggered” or “maintained”
blank         | 
text          | situational interest in. Reading Rainbow in particular facilitated this process by allowing
blank         | 
text          | children on their own initiative to peruse a variety of titles and select content that
blank         | 
text          | connected with their personal areas of interest and knowledge. In terms of exposure to
blank         | 
text          | spoken and written English language, in these cases the ability to seek out content based
blank         | 
text          | on interest may have played some role in facilitating children’s interaction with ebooks
blank         | 
text          | and thus with these forms of language. In the home setting where in most cases children
blank         | 
text          | were not being obliged to read ebooks, interest was a key factor in attracting children to
blank         | 
text          | ebook content. Rather than engaging in the activity in order to “learn to read,” as might
blank         | 
text          | be emphasized in the phonics approach literacy, common in popular educational apps
blank         | 
text          | (Guernsey, Levine, Chiong, & Severns, 2012), ebook materials that overlapped with
blank         | 
text          | children’s interests offered children the opportunity to “read to learn,” or if they were not
blank         | 
text          | always attending to the text, then at least “listening” to learn.

text          | Co-reading and collaborative English learning with ebooks
blank         | 
text          |        Four parents – Rebeca Rivera, Sara Morales, Érica Martínez and Natalia Acosta –
blank         | 
text          | reported using ebooks together with their children, and/or were documented in
blank         | 
text          | observations doing so. These parents also reported that they felt this co-reading was
blank         | 
text          | helpful to them to improve or practice their English, at least in some aspects such as
blank         | 
text          | pronunciation. As reflected in Rebeca’s quote earlier in this section, these parents saw
blank         | 
text          | ebooks as a useful opportunity not only to hear English spoken as one does watching

blank         | 
text          | to a page, stopping and repeating. These four mothers, three of whom were actively
blank         | 
text          | working to improve their English through classes and written homework assignments,
blank         | 
text          | found it helpful to hear the words spoken aloud and try to emulate their pronunciation. In
blank         | 
text          | some of the observation sessions where parents and children read ebooks together,
blank         | 
text          | parents and/or children asked questions about meaning and in some cases worked
blank         | 
text          | collaboratively to help one another understand a story. The fact that this activity engaged
blank         | 
text          | both children and parents, and was also considered a useful language learning activity by
blank         | 
text          | parents, points to an opportunity to further research the potential of these tools for family
blank         | 
text          | learning.
blank         | 
text          |        Of the three parents I observed co-reading ebooks with their child(ren) on the iPad,
blank         | 
text          | each had a distinctive style. Sara Morales was riveted to the screen during her sessions
blank         | 
text          | sitting beside Estela and exploring books, which included The Three Bears Christmas
blank         | 
text          | book, and the National Geographic Kids Penguins book, listening to the narration and
blank         | 
text          | following along silently. However, neither Sara nor Estela asked questions or made
blank         | 
text          | comments along the way. Sara described in her interview that she felt reading the ebooks
blank         | 
text          | with Estela helped her learn English, however I did not observe interactions during the
blank         | 
text          | reading sessions that could indicate what mother or daughter were focusing on, or any
blank         | 
text          | type of dialogic reading as part of the activity.
blank         | 
text          |        Natalia Acosta noted that of the types of apps on the iPad, ebooks were one of the
blank         | 
text          | few that the family engaged with together (their family did not use the Reading Rainbow
blank         | 
text          | app, but they used the individual ebooks installed including Toy Story, La Gallina
blank         | 
text          | Roja/Red Hen and Peter Rabbit. When Natalia used ebooks with the children, she did

text          | points in the text, which the children in turn responded to. During the example below,

text          | where they were in visual contact with text in English and heard it spoken at the same

text          |              In Rebeca Rivera’s family, ebooks became part of family reading practices for
blank         | 
text          | Rebeca and her two daughters Jessica and Yelitza. Rebeca had a long established routine
blank         | 
text          | of reading traditional books regularly with her daughters. Although the family did not
blank         | 
text          | co-read ebooks during any of the observations, Rebeca reported in the final parent
blank         | 
text          | interview that she enjoyed reading ebooks with the children, and had recently begun to do
blank         | 
text          | so often once she quit her restaurant job and began spending more evenings with the girls.
blank         | 
text          | As she mentions in the quote shared at the beginning of this section, Rebeca found
blank         | 
text          | reading ebooks with her daughters to be a useful practice for learning about English
blank         | 
text          | pronunciation; she could listen to how the words sounded in the narration and then turn it
blank         | 
text          | off and read it herself. In this way, joint ebook use became a learning activity for both
blank         | 
text          | parent and children. The books that Rebeca described reading with the children were
blank         | 
text          | largely titles that appealed to both girls including Rapunzel, Bella and Harry and The
blank         | 
text          | Halloween Forest. In the latter, according to Rebeca, Yelitza enjoyed chiming in in
blank         | 
text          | particular moments where the book says “trick or treat!.” Among the mothers in the
blank         | 
text          | study, Rebeca had the most English proficiency, and she was the only parent who

text          | reported reading the ebooks both with and without narration (reading the story aloud
blank         | 
text          | herself). In further research, studying families’ activities using a larger selection of
blank         | 
text          | Spanish-English ebooks could shed light on how ebook language might relate to joint
blank         | 
text          | reading in Hispanic-Latino immigrant families.
blank         | 
text          |            Saúl Jr. and David Martínez also regularly used the Reading Rainbow app,
blank         | 
text          | sometimes with their mother Érica. Soon after receiving the iPad, Érica identified the
blank         | 
text          | Reading Rainbow ebooks as a resource she wanted her children to use and incorporated
blank         | 
text          | them into their routine after school, when the boys traded off between working on their
blank         | 
text          | homework and playing on the iPad (previously on the laptop or phone). Saúl Jr. and
blank         | 
text          | David were avid video game players, and when they received their iPad they quickly
blank         | 
text          | downloaded several free apps similar to the ones they were accustomed to playing on
blank         | 
text          | their mother’s phone such as Minion Rush and Blocksworld. Once Érica discovered
blank         | 
text          | Reading Rainbow, she subsequently made it a requirement for the boys to use ebooks on
blank         | 
text          | the app for certain amounts of time before they were allowed to play games, in addition
blank         | 
text          | to the reading and homework assignments they needed to complete for school. At this
blank         | 
text          | point in the study, Érica reported that Saúl Jr.’s school no longer subscribed to the
blank         | 
text          | MyOn.com service, and thus they were no longer able to access ebooks that way.
blank         | 
text          | AppStat reports showed the family opened Reading Rainbow app 52 times for a total of
blank         | 
text          | 11 hours of use during the first two weeks they used it, corresponding to the period when
blank         | 
text          | Érica applied the reading “prerequisite.” After that initial spike, Érica relaxed the policy
blank         | 
text          | and use fell sharply but remained regular; the family opened the app between three and
blank         | 
text          | ten times per week and spent about 28 minutes per week with the app on average. The
blank         | 
text          | other five families who used the app ranged widely, spending between 120 total minutes

blank         | 
text          | week with it) with an overall average of 38 minutes per week.
blank         | 
text          |        As Érica expressed in her quote at the beginning of this section, she felt using
blank         | 
text          | ebooks was useful to her for learning English pronunciation. Érica began using ebooks
blank         | 
text          | with her sons soon after receiving the iPad, and this activity emerged in multiple
blank         | 
text          | observations. For this reason, there were several opportunities to observe how mother
blank         | 
text          | and sons interacted when reading together, and some of the ways in which Érica and the
blank         | 
text          | boys collaborated to access meaning from the stories they read. In contrast other parents
blank         | 
text          | like Rebeca Rivera reported co-reading ebooks only in the final interview and the
blank         | 
text          | practice did not come up during observations.
blank         | 
text          |            As discussed to some extent in the Chapter Four example of Saúl Jr. using the
blank         | 
text          | MyOn.com library, when it came to choosing English-language books for her children
blank         | 
text          | (both traditional and electronic), Érica tended to seek out very simple texts that would not
blank         | 
text          | be too challenging for them to understand. She used the same approach when using the
blank         | 
text          | Reading Rainbow app. After each boy filled out his “backpack” profile, choosing his
blank         | 
text          | gender, age and interest areas, Érica returned and changed the children’s ages to the
blank         | 
text          | minimum setting (“4 years old or younger”) so that the app would recommend simpler
blank         | 
text          | books. This meant that recommended books, in this case simpler picture books, appeared
blank         | 
text          | marked “recommended for you!” at the beginning of the list, though all of the other
blank         | 
text          | books were still available to choose from as well. Érica was the only parent in the sample
blank         | 
text          | who did this, and she may have been particularly concerned given that her children were
blank         | 
text          | newly arrived in this country and had had much less exposure to English than children in
blank         | 
text          | the other families.

text          |              In guiding the children to use ebooks, Érica appeared to apply some of the
blank         | 
text          | same criteria as in the MyOn.com example (see Chapter Four). It was important to Érica
blank         | 
text          | that the boys were able to decode the language they were reading and hearing, to the
blank         | 
text          | extent that she appeared to discourage them from reading books she did not think they
blank         | 
text          | had the language skills to understand. The following exchange occurred while Saúl Jr.
blank         | 
text          | was navigating Reading Rainbow with his mother during a home visit:
blank         | 
text          | Érica: Y las palabras que no entendemos, pues
              | las buscamos, para ver lo que significan. Pero la        Érica: And the words that we don’t understand we
              | mayoría es… les puse nivel principiante [referring       look up, to see what they mean. But mostly it’s…
              | to age “four or younger” setting] porque en              I put it at beginner level [referring to the age “four
              | inglés practicamente ellos son de nivel de kinder,       or younger setting] because in English basically
              | o de primero.                                            they are at the kindergarten or first grade level.

              | llegue un poco…                                          get a little…
              | Érica: Porque ha sido que les pongo yo un libro          Erica: Because it has happened that I put on a
              | con muchas letras en inglés y no saben lo                book with a lot of letters in English and they
              | que…que es lo que dice.                                  don’t know what… what it means.
              | Amber: Y como escogen los libros?                        Amber: And how do you all choose the books?
              | Érica: Pues es como les guste a ellos.                   Saúl: I want to read this one, but my mom doesn’t
              | Saúl: Yo quiero leer este, pero mi mamá no               want –
              | quiere –                                                 E: Its that it’s a lot. It’s a lot of letters and I tell
              | Érica: Es que es mucho. Es mucha letra y yo le           him he won’t understand it.
              | digo que no le va a entender.
blank         | 
text          | To a similar effect later, when Saúl selected another book with approximately five to ten
blank         | 
text          | lines of text per page, Érica explained: “Como esos allí, mira. Siento que son muy,
blank         | 
text          | muy… con muchas palabras ¿entiendes? Yo siento que todavía no estamos ni ellos ni yo
blank         | 
text          | a ese nivel.” (Like these here [pointing to block of text]. I feel that it’s very, very… that
blank         | 
text          | it has a lot of words, you know? I feel that neither they nor I are at that level yet). Saúl
blank         | 
text          | Jr. appeared to be respecting his mother’s criteria for what acceptable reading material
blank         | 
text          | was. For example, as he browsed the selection of books later in the same visit, he came
blank         | 
text          | across one. “Ma,” he asked his mother, “El de SuperChicken era mucho ¿verdad?”
blank         | 
text          | (“Mom, the SuperChicken one was a lot, right?”) to which Érica answered in the
blank         | 
              |

              |

text          | affirmative, and Saúl continued browsing. Érica’s example of a book she felt was fun
blank         | 
text          | and appropriate was Chicken Butt, which has just a sentence or two on each page
blank         | 
text          | (sometimes only a few words) and is a humorous exchange between a father and a son.
blank         | 
text          | “Guess what?” the boy character asks. “What?,” replies the father. “Chicken butt!”
blank         | 
text          | answers the boy, and so on with several similar riddle/rhymes. The reading level and
blank         | 
text          | vocabulary were very basic and six-year-old David enjoyed reenacting the joke with his
blank         | 
text          | mother in English. As Érica described:
blank         | 
              | 
text          |                                                     And now I say [to David], ‘You know what?’ And
              | Y ahora ya le digo: You know what? Y ya sabe        he knows because of the chicken. You know what
              | por el pollito. You know what. (Risas). Y les       (laughter). And they like it because he says…
              | gusta porque hace… what? Y yo le traduzco a         what? And I translate for them what it means, so
              | ellos qué es lo que quiere decir, para que ellos    they start making the connection with what it
              | vayan conectando qué es lo que quiere decir. Y      means. And it’s useful to me for pronunciation. I
              | me sirve a mí por la pronunciación. Me parece       find the book really funny.
              | muy gracioso el libro.

              | 
              | 
text          |              Érica also had a particular approach to interacting with the ebooks that she
blank         | 
text          | guided the children to use. When the children read on their own (for example, in the visit
blank         | 
text          | mentioned above Érica was helping David finish his homework for some time while Saúl
blank         | 
text          | used Reading Rainbow) she had instructed the boys to read each book once listening to
blank         | 
text          | the narration, and then to read without it. When Érica read together with the boys, she
blank         | 
text          | repeated words and phrases that were read by the narration, modeling this practice for the
blank         | 
text          | boys, and also translated words for them when they asked. For example, a discussion
blank         | 
text          | arose during one story that the family opened, which dealt with a child using the phrase
blank         | 
text          | “I hate you” and learning how hurtful it could be:

text          | Sometimes, content in the book inspired
blank         | 
text          | other conversations between mother and children, not necessarily related to, but inspired
blank         | 
text          | by the story. For example, at one point in the above book, the parent explains that saying
blank         | 
text          | “I hate broccoli” is OK, but that using the word “hate” to other people is not. Based on
blank         | 
text          | the broccoli in the illustration, Érica commented in jest: “Le va a castigar dándole
blank         | 
text          | brócoli. Así voy a hacer con ustedes” (“She [the mother] is going to punish him by
blank         | 
text          | giving him broccoli. [joking] That’s what I’ll do with you guys.”) Although in this case
blank         | 
text          | the family members did not catch the exact meaning of the excerpt, it led to a playful
blank         | 
text          | exchange between mother and sons, as Érica mimed serving a plate of broccoli and Saúl
blank         | 
text          | and David feigned protest.

text          |          These examples of ebook use by children and joint use by children with their
blank         | 
text          | parents show some ways in which families took up ebook resources, and engaged
blank         | 
text          | repeatedly in a language- and literacy-related activity that most of them had not had
blank         | 
text          | access to before. These examples point to ways in which ebooks can serve as a means for
blank         | 
text          | children to expand on their interests by browsing libraries of ebooks, and can engage
blank         | 
text          | parents to participate along with their children with the intent of developing their own
blank         | 
text          | English skills. The question raised in Chapter Four based on Saúl Martínez’ use of

text          | MyOn.com can also be applied to the use of ebooks with the iPad. In some cases, the
blank         | 
text          | content of books children were interested in may not have been within their zone of
blank         | 
text          | proximal development in the situation at hand, as help with the reading task was not
blank         | 
text          | present at the moment to support their reading a higher level. For example, Bryanna
blank         | 
text          | Parra often used the Brave storybook app I had installed for her (based on her interest in
blank         | 
text          | the Brave movie), but she preferred to use the accompanying games in the app, rather
blank         | 
text          | than read the book itself, even with the spoken narration. “No me gusta leer tanto el
blank         | 
text          | libro,” she explained, porque algunas páginas tienen muchas letras.” (I don’t like to read
blank         | 
text          | the book as much because some pages have a lot of letters). It appeared that the amount
blank         | 
text          | of text on the page seemed to discourage Bryanna from reading the Brave storybook, or
blank         | 
text          | perhaps the option of the games within the app were more inviting to her and did not
blank         | 
text          | require as much effort.
blank         | 
text          |        The ways that families used ebooks suggests that there is potential for these tools to
blank         | 
text          | engage families in joint activities. However, many questions still remain as to what
blank         | 
text          | learning value ebook reading at home offers for children and adults, and what the best
blank         | 
text          | features of ebooks are to maximize learning for language minority families. Questions
blank         | 
text          | that arise but that this study cannot answer include: How do children’s use of ebooks at
blank         | 
text          | home compare with other home reading experiences? How can we know whether
blank         | 
text          | families are simply listening and looking at pictures in ebooks, or also focusing on
blank         | 
text          | reading text? What kinds of background knowledge and/or vocabulary might families be
blank         | 
text          | learning from using ebooks? In addition to these questions for future research, the data
blank         | 
text          | presents challenges for design. What opportunities might ebooks provide for children to
blank         | 
text          | read at different levels depending on their current abilities or desires? Finally, as

title         | VI. Language production with the iPads: creative storytelling apps
blank         | 
text          |        Another set of apps installed on families’ iPads was a small group of creative
blank         | 
text          | production apps, most of which were some form of storytelling tools. These apps
blank         | 
text          | allowed for children, who were quite accustomed to consuming various types of media, to
blank         | 
text          | also create in some of the same genres, including animated cartoons, illustrated books
blank         | 
text          | and comics. In the research on literacy development, storytelling and narrative are
blank         | 
text          | highlighted as important building blocks (Cassell, 2004). “Outisde-in” writing skills, as
blank         | 
text          | termed by Whitehurst and Lonigan (1998) and use of decontextualized language are
blank         | 
text          | important aspects of literacy that begin in children’s early storytelling practices. As
blank         | 
text          | Cassell points out, “Children’s readiness for the outside–in aspects of writing literacy
blank         | 
text          | begins in play and storytelling activities that do not explicitly involve the decoding or
blank         | 
text          | creation of text” (p. 77).
blank         | 
text          |        The iPad apps provided access to production designed specifically for young users
blank         | 
text          | (as opposed to iMovie or other videomaking tools primarily for older users). The most
blank         | 
text          | popular creative apps among the children in the study were Toontastic, Toontastic Jr.,
blank         | 
text          | Superhero Comic Book Maker and Princess Fairytale Maker, which share the function of
blank         | 
text          | allowing children to record stories by selecting backgrounds and characters, moving them
blank         | 
text          | and recording their own voice over dialogue or narration. While Superhero Comic Book

              |

              | 	  
text          | Maker and Princess Fairytale Maker provide more basic functions – selecting one
blank         | 
text          | background and set of characters for a one-scene story. Toontastic is a richer tool that
blank         | 
text          | scaffolds the storytelling process – prompting children to record their story using a
blank         | 
text          | narrative arc with Setup, Challenge, Conflict, Climax and Resolution. Toontastic Jr.
blank         | 
text          | offers a more supported and simplified structure (beginning, middle, end) for younger
blank         | 
text          | users, and starts each scene off, prompting children to finish it.
blank         | 
text          |        Other creative storytelling programs installed on the iPads were not regularly taken
blank         | 
text          | up. For example, the book creation tool “My Story” and the comic-making app “Strip
blank         | 
text          | Designer” (installed for the Martínez boys due to their interest in comics) were used little.
blank         | 
text          | In one case when Naomi and Eduardo Aguirre began making books using My Story, they
blank         | 
text          | reported that this practice began after their older cousin helped them make their first one.
blank         | 
text          | Saúl Martínez Jr., who tried out Strip Designer but never created a comic, expressed
blank         | 
text          | when asked about it that he found the app too difficult to use. From this limited data it
blank         | 
text          | appeared that Strip Designer and My Story may be better suited for guided experiences
blank         | 
text          | with adults (which did not emerge at all in the data) or for older children to use on their
blank         | 
text          | own (the suggested ages are eight years for Strip Designer and six to eight for My Story.
blank         | 
text          | However, these tools may also be envisioned in a guided classroom setting, where
blank         | 
text          | children can access instruction and support at various points during a project. Table 7g

              | 
text          |            The fact that children in the study engaged regularly with several of the storytelling
blank         | 
text          | apps is notable in and of itself. Storytelling is an important component of early literacy
blank         | 
text          | (e.g. Teale & Sulzby, 1986) and the ways in which storytelling apps elicited language
blank         | 
text          | production from children, most often in Spanish but sometimes also in English or a
blank         | 
text          | mixture of the two. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, Amanda Acosta enjoyed
blank         | 
text          | recording herself singing songs in English to accompany her Toontastic creations. Estela
blank         | 
text          | Morales created scenes using Toontastic and Princess Fairytale Maker, with all character
blank         | 
text          | dialogue in English. Others, particularly Naomi Aguirre and Brandon Orozco recorded
blank         | 
text          | themselves mainly Spanish but also certain English words and phrases in their scenes.
blank         | 
text          | For example, Naomi Aguirre’s animated story about a presidential election included the
blank         | 
text          | following:
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Candidate character: ... Yo les voy a                                       Candidate character:… I’m going to show
              | enseñar, que yo sí soy un buen presidente.                                  them that I am a good president.
              | Supporter: Yay!                                                             Supporter: Yay!
              | Character: ¡Yo voy a votar por Dr. King!                                    Character: I’m going to vote for Dr. King! [in

text          |             Children in the study used the creative storytelling tools in varying ways and
blank         | 
text          | spent varying amounts of time with different parts of the creative process. Some children
blank         | 
text          | used the tools as a stage for their imaginative play, rather telling cohesive stories.
blank         | 
text          | Amanda Acosta, the youngest of the focal children and sister to two-and-a-half year old
blank         | 
text          | Susi, created scenes using Toontastic, sometimes including more than one scene and
blank         | 
text          | incorporating backdrops that she designed herself. The “voiceover” for Amanda’s stories
blank         | 
text          | often featured her singing songs, rather than narrating or speaking for her characters.
blank         | 
text          | Notably, the songs that Amanda often chose to sing were in English. The origin of these
blank         | 
text          | songs was unclear, but Amanda likely learned them in school or possibly via the musical
blank         | 
text          | English-language shows such as Bubble Guppies that she enjoyed singing along with on
blank         | 
text          | TV. Additionally, some children spent time creating the visual settings for their stories –
blank         | 
text          | coloring in scenes, choosing characters, drawing and so on. In the programs such as
blank         | 
text          | Princess Fairytale Maker, Superhero Comic Book Maker and My Storybook Maker,
blank         | 
text          | children had the option of creating visual scenes and saving them without recording.
blank         | 
text          | During home visits I observed children engaging in all of these activities as well as
blank         | 
text          | verbally telling and recording their stories. How much of children’s total time using the
blank         | 
text          | storytelling apps was spent with each of these phases in the process is not possible to
blank         | 
text          | determine from the existing data.
blank         | 
text          |        For some children, using the creative storytelling apps build new dimensions on
blank         | 
text          | expressive activities they had begun in the past. As mentioned in Chapter Five, Bryanna
blank         | 
text          | Parra was accustomed to recording her voice or taking photos and video on her mother’s
blank         | 
text          | phone. However, according to Karina and Bryanna’s reports these recordings had usually
blank         | 
text          | been more a form of play and experimentation than constructed stories or messages.

text          | included Toontastic, Toontastic Jr. Shrek, Princess Fairytale Maker, iDiary and Draw &
blank         | 
text          | Tell. In total, Bryanna spent approximately 394 minutes over the three months using
blank         | 
text          | these apps (see Table 6d). The artifacts that Bryanna shared during visits showed that she
blank         | 
text          | spent significant amounts of this time recording her thoughts and stories, however it is
blank         | 
text          | difficult to determine the exact proportion between creating stories and using other
blank         | 
text          | functions (Princess Fairytale Maker, iDiary and Draw & Tell offer other activities such as
blank         | 
text          | drawing and coloring).
blank         | 
text          |        Children did not always take advantage of the full potential of these storytelling
blank         | 
text          | tools. In Toontastic, which attempts to guide children to create a sequential scenes as
blank         | 
text          | components of the story arc, children often made single-scene stories, or made multiple
blank         | 
text          | scenes that were unrelated to one another. Based on observational data, ABIs and parent
blank         | 
text          | interviews, children were usually navigating the creative storytelling apps on their own
blank         | 
text          | (in the families where there were two children, these tools were sometimes used jointly
blank         | 
text          | between siblings). Sometimes, siblings took turns creating scenes, but were not aware
blank         | 
text          | that they could make one longer story; instead they took turns making separate scenes,
blank         | 
text          | each one starting anew. Furthermore, the instructions in the apps were in English, so
blank         | 
text          | some parents may have had trouble guiding their children, even if they had participated.
blank         | 
text          | Thus while children’s interest in storytelling apps and their engagement in using them
blank         | 
text          | was compelling, there also appeared to be certain missed opportunities in terms of fully
blank         | 
text          | harnessing these tools to help children understand narrative structure and create more in-
blank         | 
text          | depth stories.

text          |        At the time of the ABI interview at the Aguirre home (the second-to-last visit with
blank         | 
text          | the family), Naomi had begun to understand how to make a multi-scene story in
blank         | 
text          | Toontastic. This was the first instance I documented in which a child made use of the
blank         | 
text          | narrative structure feature of Toontastic and created a full, five-scene animation from
blank         | 
text          | start to finish that told one cohesive story. In her story, Naomi used the play set of
blank         | 
text          | historical figures to create a presidential election story, where a nobler African-American
blank         | 
text          | incumbent candidate is running against a white candidate that promises money and bigger
blank         | 
text          | houses for the poor.

              | 
              | 
text          | Besides her established interest and practice in media production, Naomi was also the
blank         | 
text          | second-oldest child in the study and had a more advanced grasp of English than many
blank         | 
text          | other children including the other third grader in the sample, Saúl Martínez (who had
blank         | 
text          | recently arrived from Mexico). These factors likely contributed to Naomi’s progress in
blank         | 
text          | understanding the capabilities of Toontastic, as in addition to experience with media
blank         | 
text          | storytelling she was able to understand more of the spoken and written direction in the
blank         | 
text          | app. She also supported her younger brother when he recorded stories, whereas while

blank         | 
text          | do.
blank         | 
text          |        Some of the creative apps also presented opportunities for the children to write texts
blank         | 
text          | to accompany their visual products. iDiary, for example, is an electronic diary that
blank         | 
text          | allows children to type, write by hand, draw, add “sticker” icons, and insert photos from
blank         | 
text          | the iPad camera roll. In figure 7h and 7i below, Saúl Martínez (left) and Bryanna Parra
blank         | 
text          | (right) show annotated photographs in their diaries – Saúl’s a screenshot he captured on

text          | the iPad, and Bryanna’s a picture of her rehearsing in costume for a school dance
blank         | 
text          | performance that had recently occurred. Saúl’s caption reads “Este. Es. Sonic. Es. Robot”
blank         | 
text          | (“This. Is. Sonic. He’s. [a] Robot.”). Bryanna’s, not shown entirely in photo, reads “Hola

blank         |

blank         | 
text          | itself?
blank         | 
text          |        The primary difference in media activities that emerged from the iPad intervention
blank         | 
text          | data was in relationship to the content families used. However, there were some cases in
blank         | 
text          | which features of the iPad device itself contributed to differences in family media
blank         | 
text          | activities, both in terms of inviting joint use and due to the ease of use of the interface for
blank         | 
text          | children (and to some extent adults as well). For instance, many of the children were
blank         | 
text          | accustomed to using apps on parents’ smartphones. However, the very small smartphone
blank         | 
text          | screen can be difficult to use jointly between two or more people. In this sense, the iPad
blank         | 
text          | offered a similar interface to the smartphone (a touchscreen, with app icons) but in larger
blank         | 
text          | form that could be more easily shared between siblings or between parent and child.
blank         | 
text          |        Some of the media activities described in prior chapters occurred both with parents’
blank         | 
text          | smartphones and with the iPads. Occasionally, family members noted that the experience
blank         | 
text          | of a particular media program was changed or improved in some way when used on the
blank         | 
text          | tablet versus on the smartphone interface. Lorena Aguirre, Érica Martínez and Natalia
blank         | 
text          | Acosta all had translator apps and used them on their smartphones prior to enrolling in
blank         | 
text          | the study. However, they all expressed that using the translator on the iPad was a better
blank         | 
text          | experience than on the smartphone due to the larger screen that allowed for viewing more
blank         | 
text          | text. Lorena also preferred using the iPad when she used the translator app with Naomi
blank         | 
text          | during homework sessions, as it was easier to share the screen between the two of them.
blank         | 
text          |        Finally, the larger interface of the iPad meant a larger keypad for typing and
blank         | 
text          | generally an easier interface for children to explore on their own than the smartphone,
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | easier for Brandon to navigate than the phones or the computer:
blank         | 
              | 
text          | José Rubén: …ahora él como qué actúa más…                   José Rubén: …now he like acts more…
              | porque se lo hemos dejado a él, que él lo use, que          because we’ve made it for him to use, for him
              | él prácticamente… que él sienta que es de él, que           to basically… for him to feel like it’s his…
              | él…, ¿verdad? que es una herramienta para él,               right? That it’s a tool for him, right? So he like
              | ¿verdad? Entonces como que él se desenvuelve                develops more, he can search for things more
              | más, ya él puede buscar un poquito más sus cosas            now, and he kind of… he does everything he
              | y todo, y ya el hace lo que él más o menos… hace            can to see how he can search for something he
              | todo lo posible por ver cómo él puede buscar                wants to know, if he doesn't… if he sees that he
              | alguna cosa que él quiere saber o algo, si ya no…           can’t, then he asks us for help.
              | si él solo ve que no puede, pues ya nos pide ayuda.         Carmen: Or to look at a book [ebook], or
              | Carmen: O ver un libro, o algo.                             something.

text          | –José Rubén & Carmen, Parent interview 2

text          | Having a larger and easier interface could facilitate children’s search activities on the
blank         | 
text          | Internet, which not only allow them to find what they are seeking, but in so doing also
blank         | 
text          | offer a vehicle for spelling words. An example arose when Brandon was using Google
blank         | 
text          | Maps, which he enjoyed to explore different countries or the streets of his own
blank         | 
text          | neighborhood. During his final ABI interview, Brandon wanted to “fly to Mexico.” He
blank         | 
text          | got up from his seat and brought over his soccer ball, which has the Mexican flag colors
blank         | 
text          | and the word “Mexico” written on it, and copied the word into the search field.

title         | Challenges Presented by the iPad
blank         | 
text          |        In general, parents were not forthcoming when it came to describing disadvantages
blank         | 
text          | of the iPad. This raised my concern that perhaps parents did not want to report
blank         | 
text          | difficulties for fear of seeming somehow ungrateful or unhappy with the iPad. I
blank         | 
text          | anticipated that culturally, parents might not feel comfortable openly “criticizing”
blank         | 
text          | something I had given them. When parents did not offer any disadvantages I actively
blank         | 
text          | probed and reassured them that I was very interested in their candid views including any

text          | disadvantages or challenges that they had encountered with the devices. However,
blank         | 
text          | parents maintained that they encountered few or no challenges with their families’ use of
blank         | 
text          | the tablet. In the two families with small children (the Rivera and Acosta families),
blank         | 
text          | parents found it challenging at times to mediate sharing between their daughters. Yelitza
blank         | 
text          | Rivera, three years old, and two-year-old Susi Acosta sometimes interrupted their older
blank         | 
text          | sisters’ iPad activities, demanded to use it themselves and had trouble observing the turn-
blank         | 
text          | taking agreements that parents brokered between siblings. In the Rivera family, this kind
blank         | 
text          | of dispute had been easier to settle with the smartphones because Rebeca had two phones,
blank         | 
text          | and if the children could not share one phone she was able to give one to each of them.
blank         | 
text          | In contrast there was only one iPad, and Yelitza was forced to learn little by little how to
blank         | 
text          | share the device with her older sister, with tears and tantrums along the way.
blank         | 
text          |        The other challenge of the iPad, as with other devices, was limiting and managing
blank         | 
text          | screen time, or engaging in “restrictive” joint media engagement (Takeuchi & Stevens,
blank         | 
text          | 2011; derived from Valkenberg, 1999), where the parents’ role is to constrain media time
blank         | 
text          | or content. It was unclear exactly how restrictive JME with the iPad compared to
blank         | 
text          | managing it with smartphones, TV or computers. Parents reported that they did not find
blank         | 
text          | it more difficult to manage or limit iPad screen time. Rebeca Rivera found the limiting
blank         | 
text          | the iPad time easier because the iPad was not as portable as smartphones. Rebeca
blank         | 
text          | explained that once Yelitza became accustomed to using the iPad, which the family did
blank         | 
text          | not take with them on outings, she stopped asking to use media on-the-go. Unlike the
blank         | 
text          | smartphones, Yelitza knew that the iPad stayed at home and she could only use it there.
blank         | 
text          | Rebeca saw this as an advantage in reducing Yelitza’s time spent with media and her
blank         | 
text          | expectation that she could use it wherever they went.

text          |        For Érica Martínez and her family, for whom several impactful changes to their
blank         | 
text          | infrastructure and routine coincided with the iPad intervention, it became difficult to
blank         | 
text          | disentangle which practices were facilitated by the iPad specifically. For example, by
blank         | 
text          | coincidence Érica had wireless Internet installed in the family home within the same
blank         | 
text          | week they received their iPad (she had ordered the installation some time before via a
blank         | 
text          | discounted Connect2Compete program). Her sons were previously familiar with
blank         | 
text          | downloading apps on smartphones, however prior to gaining home Internet access they
blank         | 
text          | relied on weak connections from open networks nearby. Thus the fact that they began to
blank         | 
text          | download various new apps and play them was hard to attribute fully to the iPad. In
blank         | 
text          | addition, Érica went from being a stay-at-home mom to working full time during the last
blank         | 
text          | month of the study and at that point the children’s iPad use appeared to increase sharply.
blank         | 
text          | With these changing conditions, it was impossible to know what the case might have
blank         | 
text          | been if the family had not received the iPad. Would the children have watched more
blank         | 
text          | television, spent more time playing with the laptop or smartphones? Or would some of
blank         | 
text          | their screen time have been replaced by other activities? Just as the intervention
blank         | 
text          | introduced certain changes, so did other shifts in families’ lives, and these intertwined
blank         | 
text          | factors cannot be isolated from one another.

              | 
              | 
text          | VIII. What previously established media routines carried over to the new iPads?
blank         | 
text          |         The combination of qualitative and quantitative data generated during the three
blank         | 
text          | months documenting families’ use of the provided iPads identified new media activities,
blank         | 
text          | as discussed above. However, it also showed that families more or less transferred many
blank         | 
text          | media activities they previously engaged in to the iPads, essentially using them much as
blank         |

blank         | 	  
              | 	  
text          | they had used smartphones or televisions before. This finding raises the issue of how
blank         | 
text          | children and families develop routines with media, from what age, and the difficulty of
blank         | 
text          | shifting these routines and expectations via interventions.
blank         | 
text          |        Some children used the iPads to download and play the same genres of games that
blank         | 
text          | they had enjoyed on other devices. For example, for young Saúl and David Martínez,
blank         | 
text          | video game playing was already an established part of the boys’ routine before the iPad
blank         | 
text          | intervention. The boys were used to playing video games that were installed on the
blank         | 
text          | family laptop, and they also knew how to download apps on their parents’ smartphones
blank         | 
text          | and on the phone they found in the street. When the family received their iPad, the boys
blank         | 
text          | were interested in playing the installed apps, but they also wanted to access content

text          | similar to what they had used before on the other devices. Although they did not
blank         | 
text          | necessarily use the same programs as they had on the smartphones or computer (the iPad
blank         | 
text          | was their first access to the Apple AppStore), they searched for content in the same
blank         | 
text          | genres they already enjoyed: fast-paced action- and adventure-based apps such as Minion
blank         | 
text          | Rush and DeathTour, car racing games such as Asphalt8 and particularly building apps
blank         | 
text          | using blocks, similar to the popular app Minecraft, including Exploration Lite and
blank         | 
text          | Survivalcraft. The Martínez boys also used the iPad more than the other families, and
blank         | 
text          | used it increasingly toward the end of the study due to their mother’s new work schedule.
blank         | 
text          | Thus, although they also regularly used the more explicitly educational apps I provided,
blank         | 
text          | they also used other content for extended amounts of time each week. As the iPad’s
blank         | 
text          | storage filled up with the many apps the boys downloaded, Érica gave them guidelines
blank         | 
text          | for downloading apps, instructing them to only download free apps, and helping them
blank         | 
text          | understand how to delete apps they were no longer using in order to make space for

blank         | 
text          | apps that had the letters “GB” (in other words, apps that occupied a gigabyte or more of
blank         | 
text          | space and that would take up considerable space on the iPad). Although Érica began by
blank         | 
text          | giving the boys the password to download apps at will, she soon changed the password
blank         | 
text          | and required the boys to get her approval before downloading new apps.
blank         | 
text          |        Jessica Rivera also used the iPad to download apps she was interested in to the iPad,
blank         | 
text          | as she was accustomed to doing on her parents’ smartphones. Jessica and Yelitza
blank         | 
text          | enjoyed playing a variety of apps, several of which were related in some way to beauty
blank         | 
text          | makeovers and the program Monster High (Monster Spa, Spa Salon, Monster Girls
blank         | 
text          | Makeover or baking (Bake Shop, Pancake Maker). In Jessica’s case, she and Yelitza
blank         | 
text          | used only the apps installed for the first two months they had the iPad. Near the end of
blank         | 
text          | the second month with the iPad, Jessica began requesting new games and over the course
blank         | 
text          | of the final month, she added progressively more games and those games occupied an
blank         | 
text          | increasing portion of Jessica’s time on the iPad.
blank         | 
text          |        Similarly, children who were accustomed to watching videos on other devices
blank         | 
text          | continued to do so on the iPad. The Martínez, Aguirre and Rivera children, as well as
blank         | 
text          | Bryanna Parra and Brandon Orozco all used YouTube extensively to watch a wide range
blank         | 
text          | of videos on the iPads, as they had also done on their parents’ phones. Besides video of
blank         | 
text          | popular children’s programs, some children also watched other types of programs on the
blank         | 
text          | iPads. For example, Bryanna enjoyed watching zumba videos by Don Omar, which she
blank         | 
text          | enjoyed dancing to, sometimes with her mother. One of Brandon’s favorite YouTube
blank         | 
text          | genres was narrated video of video game play, with games such as Batman 2. As
blank         | 
text          | mentioned in Chapter Four, Naomi Aguirre became an avid watcher of the DIY video

blank         | 
text          | pre- and post- iPad intervention, as I do not have quantitative measures or histories of
blank         | 
text          | videos children watched prior to the iPad intervention. Additionally, although I prompted
blank         | 
text          | families about the kinds of videos they watched using YouTube on the iPads, the AppStat
blank         | 
text          | reports only provide the amount of time spent using the YouTube app, and does not
blank         | 
text          | specify the individual videos watched, or for how long. Four of the children also made
blank         | 
text          | considerable use of the PBSKids app to watch programs such as Daniel, Dinosaur Train
blank         | 
text          | and Word World. Although it is not possible to determine how the use of the PBSKids
blank         | 
text          | app differed from the ways children watched the shows on television, the PBSKids app
blank         | 
text          | was curated specifically for children and provided a way for children to access
blank         | 
text          | programming on-demand in a way that was easy for children to control.
blank         | 
text          |        For the children in the remaining two families, Estela Morales and Amanda and
blank         | 
text          | Susi Acosta, it was more difficult to determine how or if children transferred previous

text          | practices to the iPad, since did not regularly use their parents’ smartphones or have their
blank         | 
text          | own mobile devices to use prior to receiving the iPad. As discussed in Chapter Six, Estela
blank         | 
text          | did use iPad apps at her cousins’ house and the types of media she was used to accessing
blank         | 
text          | there began to be reflected during observation visits. For example, Estela’s cousins had a
blank         | 
text          | Netflix account, and when Estela took her iPad with her to their home her aunt installed
blank         | 
text          | the Netflix app on it and entered their account information. Estela showed
blank         | 
text          | disappointment that she couldn’t use the Netflix app at home, because the family did not
blank         | 
text          | have an Internet connection.
blank         | 
text          |        Between the two families who downloaded a considerable number of new apps to
blank         | 
text          | the iPad (the Martínez family with two boys, and the Rivera family with two girls), it is

text          | interesting to note the differences from a gender perspective. Although these were four
blank         | 
text          | children within an already small sample of eleven, it is worthwhile to highlight for future
blank         | 
text          | exploration the ways that gendered marketing appeared to shine through in the children’s
blank         | 
text          | app choices. Whereas children in both families downloaded some apps in common
blank         | 
text          | including Minion Rush, overall the Martínez boys chose more apps based on what might
blank         | 
text          | be considered typically “boy-oriented” themes such as action heroes, car racing and
blank         | 
text          | ninjas; apps include Survivalcraft, Grand Theft Auto, MegaMan X, Spiderman, Pixelgun
blank         | 
text          | 3D, Iron Man 3, and Lego DC. Jessica and Yelitza Rivera, in contrast, downloaded many
blank         | 
text          | games with more typically “female” themes, such as Bake Shop, Moster Pack (related to
blank         | 
text          | Monster High), Pancake Maker – Kids Cooking Game, Lilttle Pony Puzzles, Coloring,
blank         | 
text          | Subway Surf, Makeover, Nail Spa – Monster Girls Games, Dress Up and Cupcake.
blank         | 
text          | Beyond the actual content of the apps, the differences are apparent in the app icons,
blank         | 
text          | which draw children to the content when they shop on the AppStore. Figure 7j and 7k
blank         | 
text          | below provides a visual comparison between an AppStat report from the Martínez family,
blank         | 
text          | and one from the Rivera family, that illustrates the contrast in app themes. Further

text          | exploration of how children filter and select programs on the AppStore or other virtual
blank         | 
text          | marketplaces, how content is organized on these platforms, and the differences between
blank         | 
text          | content that boys and girls are accessing, may provide further information on how gender
blank         | 
text          | differences may be perpetuated (or changed) via these activities.

              | 
text          |              Parents in the study generally used the iPads to engage in similar activities they
blank         | 
text          | had used on their smartphones. In six of the seven families (all the families that could get
blank         | 
text          | Internet access on their iPads at home) parents used the iPad to access programs they had
blank         | 
text          | used before – web searches, Facebook, translator apps, streaming music or watching
blank         | 
text          | online videos, and in two cases also for video calling on Facetime. Rebeca Rivera was
blank         | 
text          | the only parent who consistently used some of the English language learning apps
blank         | 
text          | installed, and one of them (Duolingo) she enjoyed and also downloaded on her phone.
blank         | 
text          | For the first month of the study, Sara Morales studied English in the evenings using the
blank         | 
text          | Wlingua Vocabulary app (which did not require an Internet connection or sign-in),
blank         | 
text          | however she did not maintain this practice beyond the initial month.

text          | addition to the “core” selection of apps I also provided a few “elective” apps that were

blank         | 	  
              | 	  
text          | chosen specifically in relationship to children’s age and interests. Many of the “custom”
blank         | 
text          | apps were ebooks or creative storytelling tools and were included in the analysis of those
blank         | 
text          | genre. Two of the custom apps were educational games based on media characters that
blank         | 
text          | children already enjoyed, such as “Curious George Zoo” (installed for Estela Morales) or
blank         | 
text          | “Bubble Guppies” (installed for Amanda and Susi Acosta). In two cases where I
blank         | 
text          | observed a parent interest not addressed by the core group of apps, I added an app for the
blank         | 
text          | parent (“Biblia Bilingue” for Natalia Acosta and “Quiosco Perú” for Karina Parra). For
blank         | 
text          | the two families with very young siblings, I also included “Leo’s pad” and three related
blank         | 
text          | apps “Leo’s Letters” and Leo’s Songs” and “Leo’s colors.”
blank         | 
text          |            There was variability in terms of how much families used the elective apps,
blank         | 
text          | however it was evident that children were attracted by the apps featuring the familiar
blank         | 
text          | television characters they knew and enjoyed – whether they were among the “core” group
blank         | 
text          | of apps, as with the PBSKids app, or custom apps. For example, Amanda and Susi (five
blank         | 
text          | and two years old) were visibly excited when they saw the Bubble Guppies app on the
blank         | 
text          | iPad, recognizing the program they enjoyed regularly on TV. They spent 457 minutes
blank         | 
text          | (over seven-and-a-half hours) using the app over the three-month period; at each bi-
blank         | 
text          | weekly data point they had used the app for between 40 and 125 minutes. This was more
blank         | 
text          | than three times the amount of time the girls spent playing with Leo’s Pad and more than
blank         | 
text          | 12 times what they spent with Timmy Tickle, which featured new characters they had not
blank         | 
text          | encountered before but were also targeted at preschoolers. Of course, other features of
blank         | 
text          | each app may have influenced the girls’ choices in myriad ways, however it seemed
blank         | 
text          | likely that a pre-existing relationship with the Bubble Guppies show and characters was
blank         | 
text          | influential in this case. The literature on “parasocial” interactions or PSI, reviewed

text          | extensively by Giles (2002), reveals various ways that people develop potentially
blank         | 
text          | powerful relationships with media characters. Giles notes that although PSI may have
blank         | 
text          | important implications for children in particular, PSIs among children have not been
blank         | 
text          | given due attention in the research.
blank         | 
text          |            There were other custom apps, however, that did not appear to grab users’
blank         | 
text          | attention. For example, young David and Saúl Martínez had expressed an interest in
blank         | 
text          | sharks during some of our visits, and thus I included the “Discovery Kids Sharks” app on
blank         | 
text          | their iPad. However the boys opened it ten times over the course of three months, for a
blank         | 
text          | total of less than one hour. However, not all children’s array of choices were the same –
blank         | 
text          | as discussed earlier, the Martínez boys were highly engaged in selecting their own apps
blank         | 
text          | on the App Store, and thus had many more choices than for example the Acosta girls who
blank         | 
text          | did not select or download their own apps.

title         | Chapter Conclusion
blank         | 
text          |            Findings from the iPad intervention in this study suggest that not only the
blank         | 
text          | iPads themselves, but specifically the new content provided to families led to some
blank         | 
text          | different media activities, predominantly among children but also sometimes involving
blank         | 
text          | joint engagement between parents and children. As highlighted at the beginning of this
blank         | 
text          | chapter, the impact of iPads was highly linked to the content installed on them. This
blank         | 
text          | content led to some new media practices related to language and literacy, including child-
blank         | 
text          | led, interest-driven learning using ebooks and storytelling apps. Families also used the
blank         | 
text          | iPads for previously established media activities.

text          |            In terms of the language and literacy experiences that were documented
blank         | 
text          | among families using their iPads, based on children’s sustained engagement with ebooks
blank         | 
text          | and storytelling tools, findings suggest that new content does have the potential to engage
blank         | 
text          | children (sometimes with their parents) in new language- and literacy-related activities
blank         | 
text          | that merit further research to assess effectiveness for learning.
blank         | 
text          |            In addition, based on the ways that children replicated their former media
blank         | 
text          | activities using the iPad, the data also suggest the importance of considering families’
blank         | 
text          | existing media routines when designing technologies or interventions, and the degree to
blank         | 
text          | which former activities may simply be carried over to new devices or settings. To a
blank         | 
text          | certain extent, people may approach devices with particular expectations and habits, with
blank         | 
text          | preferences for particular genres they have come to enjoy. Understanding how these
blank         | 
text          | media routines develop is also an important process to investigate in future research,
blank         | 
text          | particularly for language minority children, who may stand to benefit in specific ways
blank         | 
text          | from media that language majority children may not (Bus, Verhallen & De Jong, 2009).

title         | DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
blank         | 
              | 
text          |        This final chapter has two purposes: to synthesize findings reported in the chapters
blank         | 
text          | above with related theoretical considerations, and to discuss implications for design,
blank         | 
text          | education practice and research. The study’s research questions are listed in the sections
blank         | 
text          | below, followed by relevant findings (numbered). Finally, limitations of the study and
blank         | 
text          | methods are considered.
blank         | 
text          |        The motivation behind this study is to identify what media content and activities
blank         | 
text          | might contribute to case families’ language and literacy experiences and consider how
blank         | 
text          | these resources might best support Hispanic-Latino immigrant families. As discussed in

text          | Chapter One, this area of research is important especially given findings from nationwide
blank         | 
text          | studies: young children spend multiple hours per day with some kind of screen content
blank         | 
text          | (Common Sense Media, 2011; 2013; Rideout, 2014). This content is often rich in
blank         | 
text          | language yet has not been thoroughly considered in the research literature in relationship
blank         | 
text          | to Hispanic-Latino immigrant families’ language and/or literacy practices (or those of
blank         | 
text          | many underserved groups, for that matter). Prior research, reviewed in Chapter One, has
blank         | 
text          | suggested that some types of technology in the home may be more beneficial than others,
blank         | 
text          | but more in-depth information is needed to understand these patterns (Espinosa et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2006).
blank         | 
text          |        The present research seeks to understand what activities and practices with media
blank         | 
text          | families engaged in using media resources and what language and literacy experiences
blank         | 
text          | these activities generate. With particular regard to language and literacy, how might
blank         | 
text          | media be useful to families? In what ways are families leveraging media tools to learn or

blank         | 
text          | the iPad intervention provided some sense of what case families might do with a tablet
blank         | 
text          | and a selection of language- and literacy-related content installed on it, in addition to the
blank         | 
text          | devices they already possessed.
blank         | 
text          |           Below, I review and discuss five major findings from this study, organized by the
blank         | 
text          | research questions they address, and then lay out implications for design and finally
blank         | 
text          | limitations of the study.
blank         | 
text          | Research Questions 1 & 2:
              | • What language and literacy experiences does media provide or facilitate for
              |    children who are developing as dual language learners and for parents who are
              |    also learning English?
              | • What language- and literacy-related media practices and activities do families
              |    engage in, either solo or together, as part of their daily routines?
blank         | 
text          |        Findings 1-3 below address these two research questions. The data presented in
blank         | 
text          | Chapters Four and Five show the different media platforms that families already had
blank         | 
text          | access to (television, computers, mobile devices, etc.). Access varied across the seven
blank         | 
text          | families, as did the media activities and language and literacy experiences that media
blank         | 
text          | provided. Media activities facilitated several different types of experiences related to
blank         | 
text          | language and literacy in that they provided exposure to a variety of spoken and/or written
blank         | 
text          | language. In several cases media tools aided family members who were learning English
blank         | 
text          | to access meaning from materials, in furthering their own pursuit of language learning or
blank         | 
text          | garnering all sorts of information. Families’ media activities included using broadcast
blank         | 
text          | media (primarily television) as well as digital media via smartphones and in some cases
blank         | 
text          | computer, game console or other devices. All families in this sample, although low-
blank         | 
text          | income, did have access to Internet-connected devices (at minimum, a smartphone) and

blank         | 
text          | overall “savviness” with technology.

              | 
text          | Finding 1: Family media practices among the seven case families were diverse and
              | included resourceful strategies for seeking knowledge via the Internet. These included a.)
              | bridging home and children’s school settings, as well as b.) parents supporting their own
              | studies and careers.
blank         | 
text          |        Chapter Four highlights the ways that families strategically took up Internet
blank         | 
text          | resources to access information and knowledge. Where knowledge of English as well as
blank         | 
text          | cost, were constraints, families used the devices they had in order to access freely
blank         | 
text          | available Internet tools and content for these purposes, exemplifying the idea of ingenuity
blank         | 
text          | in tight circumstances (McDermott & Raley, 2011) or inventos (Schwartz & Gutiérrez,
blank         | 
text          | forthcoming). Families from varying educational backgrounds used these strategies.
blank         | 
text          | Although the three parents with the most advanced formal schooling (Lorena and
blank         | 
text          | Eduardo Aguirre and José Rubén Orozco) were among those who demonstrated the most
blank         | 
text          | sophisticated uses of technology for learning, so were parents who had completed a
blank         | 
text          | primary or middle school education (Rebeca and César Rivera, Érica Martínez, and
blank         | 
text          | Natalia and Miguel Acosta). Families’ prior experiences including their own schooling
blank         | 
text          | certainly contributed to their repertoires with technology, but limited formal schooling
blank         | 
text          | did not appear to be a barrier to developing advanced uses. In creating a chapter about
blank         | 
text          | “knowledge seeking” I emphasize that knowledge seeking does not exclude
blank         | 
text          | “entertainment” (or fun!), but I wish to show that families were using media in inventive
blank         | 
text          | ways to solve problems and further their goals.

title         | Bridging Home and School Settings
blank         | 
text          |        Echoing Barron’s (2006) discussion of media as part of the learning ecologies
blank         | 
text          | framework, the data presented suggest ways that media contributes to bridging home and
blank         | 
text          | school contexts and/or allowing children to expand on school-related interests at home.
blank         | 
text          | These opportunities could be developed in further research to understand how technology
blank         | 
text          | can support interest-driven learning across settings and/or children’s homework efforts.
blank         | 
text          | In addition, educators can explore how to take advantage of these opportunities to forge
blank         | 
text          | links between learning in school and (child and adult) students’ activities at home with
blank         | 
text          | their families.
blank         | 
text          |        Online video is one tool that played a role in facilitating these cross-boundary
blank         | 
text          | connections. When Brandon Orozco became interested in leaders from history such as
blank         | 
text          | Martin Luther King, Jr. and asked his parents about him, YouTube was a resource
blank         | 
text          | Brandon’s father José Rubén turned to, brokering more in-depth learning about historical
blank         | 
text          | figures. Both children and parents used online video resources, as when Érica Martínez
blank         | 
text          | used YouTube videos to deepen her understanding of English pronunciation and Rebeca
blank         | 
text          | Rivera used online elementary math tutorials to bolster her own knowledge in order to
blank         | 
text          | support her daughter with math homework. In these ways we see how exploring media
blank         | 
text          | can be a conduit for making learning connections in- and out-of-school. Particularly
blank         | 
text          | considering the attention to the issue of home-school “discontinuities” (Goldenberg et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2005; Valdés, 1996) as well as continuities, media’s role in mediating these settings
blank         | 
text          | merits further consideration and experimentation.
blank         | 
text          |        Families showed much ingenuity (echoing McDermott, 2010) in leveraging free,
blank         | 
text          | portable translator apps, which also played a role in bridging home and school learning.
blank         |

              |

              | 	  
text          | The use of translator apps to understand English-language instructions on children’s
blank         | 
text          | homework assignments is a primary example of how media can be a means through
blank         | 
text          | which families access meaning that is vital to their children’s schooling. In this activity,
blank         | 
text          | reported by three families and observed multiple times in the Aguirre family (Naomi
blank         | 
text          | received frequent assignments in English and completed her homework at home), the
blank         | 
text          | translator apps were a tool that parent and child used to collaboratively determine the
blank         | 
text          | meaning of text. While Naomi had a more advanced understanding of the English
blank         | 
text          | language than her mother Lorena, Lorena brought her own understanding of math as well
blank         | 
text          | as a critical awareness of how the translator app worked and how to elicit the best results
blank         | 
text          | with it. In this way, similar to Katz’ (2010) observations of children brokering media
blank         | 
text          | content for their families, both parent and child bring skills and knowledge to the table to
blank         | 
text          | jointly access information and complete tasks.
blank         | 
              | 
text          | Parents’ media strategies to further their own studies or careers
blank         | 
text          |        Chapter Four also showed the various ways that parents actively took up Internet
blank         | 
text          | tools, particularly translator apps but also online video and other resources to further their
blank         | 
text          | own careers and studies – both studies of English language and studies in English such as
blank         | 
text          | GED courses. In this way Érica Martínez, who needed to access employment ads but had
blank         | 
text          | limited English proficiency, devised a strategy of using Google Translate side-by-side
blank         | 
text          | with Craigslist in order to search for jobs. Érica, along with César Rivera also tapped
blank         | 
text          | into the enormous variety of free video available on YouTube to access English lessons
blank         | 
text          | and other content to support their English learning. Miguel Acosta, who felt he deserved
blank         | 
text          | a raise in wages but whose boss did not speak Spanish, crafted a use of the translator app
blank         | 
text          | to fit his own language and literacy strengths, and this adaptation allowed him to write a
blank         | 
              | 
              |

text          | letter in English. Thus, families’ intentional and inventive uses of Internet tools for
blank         | 
text          | learning purposes is one set of language and literacy experiences present in media
blank         | 
text          | routines. It is also indicative of parents’ resourcefulness and motivation to learn, which
blank         | 
text          | they in turn modeled for their children.
blank         | 
text          |        Beyond what is included in the chapter, my observations among some of the
blank         | 
text          | parents and especially mothers in the study suggest that language learning technology is
blank         | 
text          | helpful and could be more helpful to parents in families like these as they endeavor to
blank         | 
text          | learn English. These parents struggle to learn English and often face challenges related
blank         | 
text          | to lack of time (especially for working mothers), lack of consistent exposure to English in
blank         | 
text          | the workplace, and the anxiety some adults feel about speaking a new language (as
blank         | 
text          | expressed in Érica’s and Natalia’s examples). I believe technologies such as apps and
blank         | 
text          | computer programs that can be used in the home could help this population in particular.
blank         | 
text          | Indeed many parents sought out these types of resources, however it is unclear how
blank         | 
text          | effective available programs are and/or what specific user profile they cater to.
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
text          | Finding 2: All case families used media content in both Spanish and English, and parents
              | felt that using many of these media programs contributed to their children’s language and
              | literacy development, as well as in some cases to their own.

text          |        Chapter Five highlights families’ media activities prior to the iPad intervention that
blank         | 
text          | fell on the “leisurely” or “recreational” end of the spectrum but that also contributed to
blank         | 
text          | learning and to families’ language and literacy experiences. Families varied in the
blank         | 
text          | breadth of different media programs and platforms they used, but all families’ daily
blank         | 
text          | routines included media in both Spanish and English. Parents across the seven families
blank         | 
text          | also felt that educational media contributed positively to their children’s literacy and

text          | English language learning. Quantitative and qualitative data align to show how media can
blank         | 
text          | support and spark learning in a variety of ways by inspiring activities such as engaging in
blank         | 
text          | question-asking and conversation with parents about media content and prompting
blank         | 
text          | occasions for children to take on the role of teacher.
blank         | 
text          |        Prior to the iPad intervention, the interactive content (games and apps) that
blank         | 
text          | families used for entertainment were less educational in nature than the television and
blank         | 
text          | video programs they used, and parents reported that television and video contributed
blank         | 
text          | more to children’s learning. It can be difficult to disentangle some of these patterns – for
blank         | 
text          | example video and television programs constituted a larger portion of what most families
blank         | 
text          | consumed than did interactive apps and games (consistent with nationally representative
blank         | 
text          | surveys overall). However in terms of mobile apps, locating and choosing high quality
blank         | 
text          | educational content can be a challenge for any parent in today’s saturated app
blank         | 
text          | marketplace. Resources such as Common Sense Media have emerged to assist parents in
blank         | 
text          | navigating this terrain, but may not be reaching parents from all socio-economic groups
blank         | 
text          | or language backgrounds.
blank         | 
text          |        The experience of preparing the iPad intervention served to illustrate the difficulty
blank         | 
text          | of finding quality learning resources for mobile devices. Although I – a doctoral student
blank         | 
text          | in a prominent school of education, specializing in learning and technology – succeeded
blank         | 
text          | in locating a series of apps that offered rich learning opportunities, I noted that this
blank         | 
text          | content is not necessarily easy for parents to find in the sea of available options.
blank         | 
text          | Research suggests that as access to devices becomes less of a hurdle, access to quality
blank         | 
text          | content and support in using it productively continues to be a challenge (e.g. Barron,
blank         | 
text          | 2006; Barron et al., 2014; Warschauer, 2010). The findings from this study, particularly

text          | the app selection process and the analysis of apps that families were using prior to the
blank         | 
text          | iPad intervention, support this claim. For example, in order to make the selection of apps
blank         | 
text          | for the iPad, I used resources such as Common Sense Media and recommendations from
blank         | 
text          | my network of educators and researchers, bringing to the process my own knowledge in
blank         | 
text          | these fields. Even so, it was challenging to locate content that offered rich language- and
blank         | 
text          | literacy-learning opportunities for children. In turn, most of the language- and literacy-
blank         | 
text          | related apps that I provided on the iPads were highly different from what children had
blank         | 
text          | had access to before on their parents’ phones, on iPods or computers. The difficulty in
blank         | 
text          | accessing high quality apps is not limited to low-income or underserved groups; many
blank         | 
text          | parents of affluent and educated backgrounds also struggle to navigate the app landscape
blank         | 
text          | and find content (Barron et al, in preparation). However, one might speculate that this
blank         | 
text          | process is even more difficult for parents who cannot read English-language materials
blank         | 
text          | and web sites.

              |

text          | Finding 3: Social interactions with relatives and broader social networks were important
              | motivators for technology use and introduced families to media practices and content.
blank         | 
text          |        With regard to how families do locate and choose media, social influences were
blank         | 
text          | very important for case families in determining content children wanted to engage with –
blank         | 
text          | characters, programs, games and activities that were popular with peers in the extended
blank         | 
text          | family or at school. This finding is particularly important for practitioners and designers

blank         | 
text          | their local social networks were the primary influence, particularly children being
blank         | 
text          | influenced by their peers. Although this phenomenon may exist across demographic or
blank         | 
text          | language groups, the nationwide Families and Media survey shows that among Hispanic-
blank         | 
text          | Latino parents, those who indicated their primary home language was not English were
blank         | 
text          | more apt to list social influences when describing ways of finding media for their
blank         | 
text          | children than were parents in primarily English-speaking families.
blank         | 
text          |        One speculation as to why language might influence patterns of choosing media is
blank         | 
text          | that many informational resources available in the U.S. (barring those via Spanish-
blank         | 
text          | language channels such as Univisión), are in English, and thus not accessible to non-
blank         | 
text          | English-speaking parents. Relying on one’s social network of trusted relatives and
blank         | 
text          | friends for parenting support and information may also be cultural-historical practices
blank         | 
text          | that stem from parents’ own upbringings. Finally, the preference for getting suggestions
blank         | 
text          | and referrals from social connections raises the importance of trusted friends and family
blank         | 
text          | members as vital sources of all types of information and support for immigrant families.
blank         | 
text          | In a country and language that is unfamiliar, one might argue that parents defer to
blank         | 
text          | personal connections they trust, rather than media messages. I do not wish to minimize
blank         | 
text          | the importance of making free online and print resources available with information
blank         | 
text          | about choosing media, however this study suggests that practitioners and designers
blank         | 
text          | wishing to reach this audience might also do well to consider how they can tap into
blank         | 
text          | families’ personal connections either via community-based organizations, schools or
blank         | 
text          | social networking tools (the latter of which all parents in this study used).

text          |        Social ties were also important motivators of media and technology use for
blank         | 
text          | families in the study. Whereas many parents had previously connected with family
blank         | 
text          | members abroad via phone calls, new technologies were beginning to change the way
blank         | 
text          | that these families maintained their transnational ties, as documented in prior studies with
blank         | 
text          | immigrant communities (e.g. Benítez, 2006). Videoconferencing as well as social media
blank         | 
text          | (primarily Facebook) and photo/video sharing were all activities that families engaged in
blank         | 
text          | to maintain connection with their loved ones in their countries of origin. This finding
blank         | 
text          | raises the question of how educators might harness these technologies – particularly
blank         | 
text          | social media – to communicate with parents in this population and/or promote sharing
blank         | 
text          | and support within school communities. Furthermore, some parents used the Internet to
blank         | 
text          | connect to their country of origin via media artifacts (shows, movies, images) from these
blank         | 
text          | places and shared them with their children as a way of helping them connect with their
blank         | 
text          | family roots. Again, awareness of these practices with media can also be leveraged
blank         | 
text          | outside the home in educational settings to create connections for students between
blank         | 
text          | different areas of their lives. In this way Chapter Six reveals the social underpinnings of
blank         | 
text          | finding and using media, as well as some of the language and literacy experiences
blank         | 
text          | families had with media (talking, videoconferencing, reading social media feeds, texting
blank         | 
text          | and so on).
blank         | 
text          |        In terms of design implications, some media products have begun to integrate
blank         | 
text          | families’ social communications and literacy for children. As an example Kindoma, a
blank         | 
text          | videoconferencing app, provides a library of children’s books to use during screen calls
blank         | 
text          | between kids and distant family members or friends. Kindoma allows both callers to see
blank         | 
text          | the picturebook and shows where the other person is pointing. Research with children in

text          | over a videoconference call) would provide interesting insight into how transnational
blank         | 
text          | media communications common in Hispanic-Latino families’ home lives might link to

text          | literacy practices.

blank         | 
text          | Finding 4: The impact of iPads was highly linked to the content installed on them. This
              | content led to some new language- and literacy-related media practices including child-

title         | Ebooks
blank         | 
text          |        Ebooks were one of the resources that families used most as part of the iPad
blank         | 
text          | intervention (beyond video). These activities with Reading Rainbow and other ebooks on
blank         | 
text          | the provided iPads, as well as one family’s experience with an online ebook library
blank         | 
text          | MyOn.com on a computer, raise questions of how electronic literacy tools including
blank         | 
text          | ebooks – which are not necessarily designed for English learners – can best serve those
blank         | 
text          | who are acquiring English as a second language. While a growing literature exists
blank         | 
text          | comparing the value of ebooks to traditional print books, only a small set of studies have

              | 	  
text          | begun to analyze the value of these tools for English learners in particular. In the present
blank         | 
text          | study, some parents engaged in co-reading ebooks with their children, and noted the
blank         | 
text          | usefulness of being able to follow along with the text of the story while also hearing the
blank         | 
text          | words pronounced for them. In addition, illustrations and in some cases animations help
blank         | 
text          | give contextual clues as to the meaning of the story.
blank         | 
text          |        Specifically in terms of language learning ebooks clearly differ from traditional
blank         | 
text          | books due to the audio (and sometimes animation) features. They also differ from
blank         | 
text          | watching television or video due to the presence of text and the ease of stopping and
blank         | 
text          | reviewing pages. The present study was not designed to measure family members’
blank         | 
text          | learning from materials. What it does show is that ebooks are resources that have the
blank         | 
text          | potential to engage family members individually and/or jointly in using this combination
blank         | 
text          | of audio, visual and textual language. Studies of students acquiring a second language
blank         | 
text          | reading multimedia books and captioned television shows in the L2 have shown positive
blank         | 
text          | relationships between this use and language gains (e.g. Bus et al., 2009; Neuman &
blank         | 
text          | Koskinen, 1992), and thus I argue that language-minority families’ use of ebooks merits
blank         | 
text          | further study as a potential support for child and/or family language learning. Moreover,
blank         | 
text          | blending overarching themes from sociocultural perspectives on SLA (see Ortega, 2009),
blank         | 
text          | and the “in-show, in-room, in-world” framework on media use (Dugan, Stevens & Mehus,
blank         | 
text          | 2010) this study highlights the importance of:
blank         | 
text          |  1.      content (what are the ebook’s content and features; what could it potentially
blank         | 
text          |          offer?);
blank         | 
text          |  2.      in-room interaction (what exchanges between parent and child, for example, might
blank         | 
text          |          shape each reader’s understanding or potential learning from the ebook?);
blank         |

text          |  3.      what is the significance of the book’s content for the child and/or parent’s life more
blank         | 
text          |          broadly? What connections do they make with personal interests, knowledge or
blank         | 
text          |          experience? How might the e-reading activity either resurface in later moments or
blank         | 
text          |          bring up connections from prior experiences (such as with Brandon and historical
blank         | 
text          |          figures or Estela and her class study of penguins)?
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
text          |        As shown in the example of Saúl Martínez using MyOn.com, questions arise as to the
blank         | 
text          | match between text difficulty and interest level of users, as well as the ways that families
blank         | 
text          | interpret the ideal way to these tools. The example suggests that currently available
blank         | 
text          | ebooks and ebook libraries may not be designed with English learners in mind, and this
blank         | 
text          | disconnect may have implications for engagement and/or learning. As Saúl navigated the
blank         | 
text          | selection of ebooks, he found that those books that matched his interests (such as the
blank         | 
text          | Dark Knight book) were not comprehensible to him at only six months’ experience
blank         | 
text          | learning English, and those books that might be more comprehensible (offering simpler
blank         | 
text          | text and supportive illustrations) were picturebooks geared toward preschoolers and the
blank         | 
text          | themes three- or four-year-old children might be interested in. While case children’s
blank         | 
text          | overall engagement with ebooks on the iPads and with the Reading Rainbow app
blank         | 
text          | indicated that children could still enjoy reading preschooler-targeted picture books and/or
blank         | 
text          | books that they may not be altogether comprehensible to them, I argue that there is an
blank         | 
text          | opportunity to use the affordances of technology to provide a better matching between
blank         | 
text          | interest and English or reading level (see Finding 6 below).

blank         | 
text          |        In addition to ebooks, the analysis of iPad intervention data revealed that children
blank         | 
text          | across the seven case families engaged regularly with creative storytelling tools provided
blank         | 
text          | on the iPads. Although some children in the study had engaged in media production prior
blank         | 
text          | to receiving the new iPads and apps, once they were provided with these tools they
blank         | 
text          | appeared to develop a new practice of recording their own scenes and stories using apps
blank         | 
text          | such as Toontastic and Superhero Comic Book Maker. While ebooks represent an
blank         | 
text          | opportunity for families to listen to narrated stories and read text, creative storytelling
blank         | 
text          | apps offered a space for children to produce – both oral language and their own digital
blank         | 
text          | animated stories. In this study, I observed children creating mostly in Spanish, although
blank         | 
text          | one child also used English in her stories. At the same time, one might imagine many
blank         | 
text          | powerful ways in which educators might leverage tools like Toontastic with English
blank         | 
text          | language learners in the classroom, as many teachers have begun to do in several other
blank         | 
text          | subject areas (see http://www.launchpadtoys.com/edu).
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
text          | Previously established routines and expectations transferred to the new iPads.
blank         | 
text          |        Findings from the iPad intervention also raise questions of how new devices (such
blank         | 
text          | as the tablets distributed in this study, or perhaps iPads or laptops distributed in a one-to-
blank         | 
text          | one school technology program) must fit within a pre-existing home ecology or media
blank         | 
text          | infrastructure already established. While new tools can lead to new practices – and in
blank         | 
text          | this study they did as shown in the examples of ebook and creative storytelling with the
blank         | 
text          | iPads – they can also facilitate old practices. In the present study, each family had
blank         | 
text          | distinct media routines and used content that shaped expectations for what an iPad might

blank         | 
text          | their own media on their parents’ smartphones, others were and expected to do the same
blank         | 
text          | using the iPad. This in turn led to the iPad being used in some cases for using the same
blank         | 
text          | genres of apps that children had grown accustomed to in the past, such as the car racing
blank         | 
text          | or superhero action games the Martínez children enjoyed and used extensively,
blank         | 
text          | particularly once their mother began working. Parents also had their own established
blank         | 
text          | media routines, and were accustomed to the portability of smartphones, which may have
blank         | 
text          | contributed to the iPad being designated as mostly for the children to use. Both parents
blank         | 
text          | and children also had established certain practices they were accustomed to engaging in
blank         | 
text          | alone or together, and this did not necessarily change with a new device. For example, in
blank         | 
text          | the case of three-year-old Yelitza Rivera who was accustomed to her own “turn” with a
blank         | 
text          | smartphone, it was not necessarily easy to share the iPad with her sister, even though the
blank         | 
text          | larger screen made it easier to view together.

              |

text          | Finding 5: Both pre- and post-iPad intervention, there was evidence that joint and/or
blank         | 
text          | collaborative language learning could and did occur between parents and children using
blank         | 
text          | media.
blank         | 
text          |          What examples did this study provide of joint learning activities with media that
blank         | 
text          | involved parents and children together? There was evidence that parents saw children’s
blank         | 
text          | media activities in English as an opportunity to develop their own English language skills,
blank         | 
text          | consistent with research on Sesame Street (Wright et al., 2001). Parents reported having
blank         | 
text          | learned some English from watching TV or video with their children, and some parents
blank         | 
text          | used ebook reading on the iPads as a way to improve their English.

              | 	  
text          |        However, media content was an important factor in inviting co-engagement by
blank         | 
text          | parents. It is worth noting that many of the instances where parents cited learning from
blank         | 
text          | media involved slower-paced educational programs with simpler vocabulary, targeted at
blank         | 
text          | preschoolers, such as Sesame Street, Caillou, Baby First and particularly Dora the
blank         | 
text          | Explorer (note that Dora is specifically designed for Latino children and blends Spanish
blank         | 
text          | and English). As I observed some children watching programming targeted at older
blank         | 
text          | children, such as Crash & Bernstein, Kick Buttowski and Monster High, in which
blank         | 
text          | dialogue and action moves very quickly and the vocabulary is highly idiomatic and
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | did. These observations raised the questions of whether, as children develop and acquire

text          | more and more English language via school and other environments their parents do not
blank         | 
text          | participate in, they become able to comprehend more complex language in media that
blank         | 
text          | their parents cannot. If this were indeed the case, then opportunities for joint learning via
blank         | 
text          | these media programs may begin to diminish as children become interested in shows for
blank         | 
text          | older kids and leave behind the preschool-age shows.

text          |        Ebooks presented an interesting alternative because with this format, not only was
blank         | 
text          | oral language input available via the ebook narration, but ebooks also offered text support
blank         | 
text          | and families could control the pace of the story. Families could review pages or
blank         | 
text          | individual words, study illustrations and stop for discussion. What the ebooks (and other
blank         | 
text          | apps) lacked was design that specifically targets parents and children both learning a

text          | second language together (as discussed in the section that follows).

text          |        Findings from the iPad preparation process (discussed in Chapter Two), wherein I

text          | evaluated hundreds of apps available on the Apple AppStore, suggest that overall there is
blank         | 
text          | at present a very limited selection of quality mobile apps for Apple that offer language-
blank         | 
text          | or literacy-related learning opportunities in Spanish (or both English and Spanish). There
blank         | 
text          | is a significant opportunity to design media-based learning tools specifically for
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino immigrant families, particularly given this dearth of tools envisioned
blank         | 
text          | with families of English learners in mind. Several selected apps, including ABC Kit for 5
blank         | 
text          | and Barefoot Atlas, possess Spanish language options. However, the two media activities
blank         | 
text          | discussed in Chapter Seven – ebook reading and creative storytelling – were largely
blank         | 
text          | limited to English-language materials due to the fact that the high quality Spanish-
blank         | 
text          | language or bilingual content available is very limited. This study did not include
blank         | 
text          | analyses of content available for Android, however designers often launch equivalent
blank         | 
text          | products in both marketplaces (or in iOS only) and there have been no indications that
blank         | 
text          | substantially more relevant resources are available on Android than on iOS.
blank         | 
text          |        In my view, the overall lack of appropriate Spanish-language or bilingual mobile
blank         | 
text          | apps, as well as language and literacy apps designed specifically for Hispanic-Latino
blank         | 
text          | immigrant families, is unfortunate and represents a missed opportunity. For monolingual
blank         | 
text          | Spanish parents or parents with limited English proficiency, navigating and evaluating
blank         | 
text          | apps that are available in English only is a potential challenge. In addition, bilingual apps

text          | Spanish-language media content has the potential to help support dual language learners

text          | in maintaining their first language, which is highly desirable, such that they acquire

text          | English in parallel rather than as a replacement. In these ways Spanish-language and/or
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | opportunities and implications for design. Google Translate and iTranslate are general
blank         | 
text          | tools designed for any use, from ordering food while on vacation abroad to translating
blank         | 
text          | business documents, and as families found while using these apps, the technology does
blank         | 
text          | not always select the correct meaning for the situation at hand. The very non-specific
blank         | 
text          | nature of translator apps call raise the question of how more tailored translation tools
blank         | 
text          | might support families as they approach academic assignments in English. This research
blank         | 
text          | points to an opportunity to develop translation tools that can be customized for the kinds
blank         | 
text          | of contexts in which families are translating, for example math or other domain areas. In
blank         | 
text          | addition, parents used translator apps to support their own English language study. This

blank         | 
text          | children (with parents in some cases), and the types of activities they offer (reading text
blank         | 
text          | with spoken narration and illustrations, recording oral stories) showed potential for

text          | offering meaningful language and literacy experiences to the Hispanic-Latino immigrant

text          | families in this study. However most of the available ebooks and storytelling

text          |        Experiments in this realm are beginning to surface, for example, one existing ebook

blank         | 
text          | this in mind, how might we design resources that are targeted at reading dyads in
blank         | 
text          | Hispanic-Latino immigrant families? What types of stories might provide occasions for
blank         | 
text          | parents to bring their own knowledge and cultural-historical backgrounds to the reading
blank         | 
text          | experience? In my search of ebook resources, I located very few that connected
blank         | 
text          | explicitly to families’ backgrounds in Latin America or their current experiences in the
blank         | 
text          | U.S., and thus I had limited opportunities to observe how specifically tailored ebooks
blank         | 
text          | might further facilitate joint reading and collaborative learning. However, the ways in
blank         | 
text          | which parents engaged in co-viewing television shows and other media from their
blank         | 
text          | countries of origin together with their children suggested that media connected to or
blank         | 
text          | drawing from parents’ own backgrounds could be a way of drawing parents in to joint
blank         | 
text          | media activities. I believe this avenue would be a fruitful one to explore in designing

text          | ebooks for Hispanic-Latino immigrant families.
blank         | 
text          |        Creating. Like ebooks, the creative storytelling apps were not necessarily
blank         | 
text          | designed with immigrant families or English learners in mind, and one might imagine
blank         | 
text          | ways that exploring customized design might lead to increased benefits for children in
blank         | 
text          | these groups. For example, children in the present study did not take full advantage of
blank         | 
text          | some affordances of the creative storytelling apps. The Toontastic app, for instance,
blank         | 
text          | which is the richest app offering explicit scaffolding for story structure, relies on users
blank         | 
text          | understanding and following spoken instructions in English. A friendly voice guide users
blank         | 
text          | through the story arc (setup, challenge, conflict, climax and resolution) –foundational
blank         | 
text          | structures to creative writing and storytelling. However, although children were engaged
blank         | 
text          | with Toontastic, they often did not comprehend the instructions or realize the connection

blank         | 
text          | these aspects if there had been instruction in Spanish, however this is difficult to
blank         | 
text          | determine since this option was not available. However, Spanish language options would
blank         | 
text          | have at least allowed parents to understand the instructions and potentially support

text          | children in creating more narratively complex stories.

title         | Recommendations for educators and practitioners
blank         | 
text          |        Based on the findings and observations above, I offer the following suggestions
blank         | 
text          | for educators and education practitioners including school administrators, librarians and
blank         | 
text          | community educators who may work with Hispanic-Latino immigrant populations.
blank         | 
text          |        The first recommendation is to recognize that screen media – whether in the form
blank         | 
text          | of television, video, apps or other programs is likely already part of students’ home
blank         | 
text          | routines and can offer an opportunity to cross home-school boundaries by extending and
blank         | 
text          | expanding upon curricular topics in the home setting. As one-to-one technology
blank         | 
text          | programs using tablets or other devices increase, educators can take increased advantage
blank         | 
text          | of ways that these devices can be used, not only for completing specific assignments, but
blank         | 
text          | also for following up on children’s interests in ways that may relate to school curricula
blank         | 
text          | and/or allow children to strengthen other meaningful interests and skills. Where one-to-
blank         | 
text          | one technology is not present, there may still be opportunities to create connections
blank         | 
text          | between home and school through families’ own media devices. Survey research has
blank         | 
text          | shown that 83 per cent of children in the U.S. have high-speed Internet at home (Rideout,
blank         | 
text          | 2014; Common Sense Media, 2013). Of the seventeen per cent who do not, some may
blank         | 
text          | have access via smartphone. A growing number of low-income families do have Internet

text          | access, either via smartphones or broadband connection, and in some communities access
blank         | 
text          | may be greater than in others. In this particular study, families were all quite low-income
blank         | 
text          | however they still owned smartphones. As device access increases, educators can take
blank         | 
text          | advantage of the opportunity to suggest educational media that parents may not be aware
blank         | 
text          | of, and model ways that media can best serve students. Conversely, as other researchers
blank         | 
text          | have suggested in the past (e.g. Dyson, 1997; Rymes, 2004) children’s interest in popular
blank         | 
text          | media can be leveraged to engage children in literacy or language activities (as in the
blank         | 
text          | example of Saúl using MyOn.com, described in Chapter Four).
blank         | 
text          |        Second, this research indicates opportunities to use creative tools such as to
blank         | 
text          | engage children in recording their own play or stories. Creative tools might include
blank         | 
text          | specifically designed programs such as Toontastic or My Storybook Maker, or they may
blank         | 
text          | be as simple as recording videos using the camera on a device, as Naomi and Eduardo
blank         | 
text          | Aguirre enjoyed doing at home. These opportunities might be explored in specific ways
blank         | 
text          | to support English language learners – incorporating scaffolded storytelling into
blank         | 
text          | classroom activities, for example, which could include allowing students to create their
blank         | 
text          | own original stories or their own versions of stories explored in school. These types of
blank         | 
text          | technology use are in agreement with other recommendations, including NAEYC’s
blank         | 
text          | stipulation that “Effective uses of technology and media are active, hands-on, engaging,
blank         | 
text          | and empowering; give the child control; provide adaptive scaffolds to ease the accom-
blank         | 
text          | plishment of tasks; and are used as one of many options to support children’s learning”
blank         | 
text          | (NAEYC, 2012, p. 6).
blank         | 
text          |        Finally, educators can play a role in helping families to learn about and access
blank         | 
text          | better quality media content, which is not always easy to find. This study suggests that
blank         |

text          | Hispanic-Latino parents (and likely parents from other demographics as well) both desire
blank         | 
text          | and could benefit from additional information on finding educational media content for
blank         | 
text          | their children. The Families and Media survey also indicates that Hispanic-Latino
blank         | 
text          | families rely more on suggestions from trusted individuals in their lives than from other
blank         | 
text          | sources, as shared in Chapter Six. Teachers and administrators in children’s schools are
blank         | 
text          | in a powerful position to help orient families about quality media content. If educators
blank         | 
text          | are able to access training and information about technology (which is not necessarily a
blank         | 
text          | given), they can pass these learnings on to families they serve.
blank         | 
text          |        As access to devices and the Internet grows both in homes and in schools, there is
blank         | 
text          | increasing space for educators to guide and shape families’ use of tools such as YouTube
blank         | 
text          | (as in Brandon’s example of searching for details on historical figures, or Rebeca’s use of
blank         | 
text          | YouTube to refresh her mathematical knowledge). Online video platforms such as
blank         | 
text          | YouTube are powerful but also unreliable, providing access to a wide range of content
blank         | 
text          | that is not necessarily accurate or optimal for the purpose at hand. Thus while families
blank         | 
text          | can engage in valuable exploration on their own, there are many ways that educators can
blank         | 
text          | improve and leverage families’ use of these tools in order to support learning at home by
blank         | 
text          | highlighting useful online videos, channels and search techniques.

blank         | 
text          | communities.
blank         | 
text          |        First, this study suggests that ebooks can engage children and families, however
blank         | 
text          | more research is needed to determine the potential learning affordances and/or challenges
blank         | 
text          | of ebooks for English learners. What particular features are helpful to language learners
blank         | 
text          | and under what conditions? In addition, in families where parents may also be learning
blank         | 
text          | the language of the book, what are the best ways for parents and children to engage with
blank         | 
text          | ebooks together? For example a study focusing on ebook resources might engage a
blank         | 
text          | larger number of participants in a study that compares groups using different types of
blank         | 
text          | ebooks, and examines assessment data over time to gauge possible differences. Research
blank         | 
text          | could also help determine more precisely how creative storytelling tools and media
blank         | 
text          | production might be best used to support language and literacy learning.
blank         | 
text          |        This study also points to multiple ways that the social context of media use is
blank         | 
text          | important in learning. Thus, in addition to specific resources that might be supportive to
blank         | 
text          | child or family learning, research could also determine the best ways that parents can
blank         | 
text          | help scaffold children’s media experiences. As shown in Saúl’s example in Chapter Four,
blank         | 
text          | a motivated and well-intentioned parent, with a powerful technology tool, may not be
blank         | 
text          | successful if she or he is not experienced in how to support the child’s attempts.
blank         | 
text          |        As mentioned in Chapter Six, families are also using Internet tools actively to
blank         | 
text          | communicate with family members in the home country. These home practices could
blank         | 
text          | also be investigated more closely to understand the role of transnational communications
blank         | 
text          | in the homes of Hispanic-Latino immigrant families might shape interactions or create
blank         | 
text          | opportunities for learning. This research might include examining families’ use of social
blank         | 
              | 
              | 
              |

text          | media, videoconferencing and text messages to understand: first, how the use of these
blank         | 
text          | technologies might relate to learning as well as how they could be used for learning
blank         | 
text          | activities; and second, how these technologies might be a part of bridging home and
blank         | 
text          | school settings and/or supporting parents, as some studies (e.g. Revelle et al., 2007; Loeb
blank         | 
text          | & York, 2013) have begun to explore using regular text messages for parents.
blank         | 
text          |        On a more general level, research (as well as education practice) could address the
blank         | 
text          | question of joint learning opportunities for parents and children who are both developing
blank         | 
text          | proficiency in a second language. These studies may or may not involve the use of media
blank         | 
text          | as a support. However, this study raises the question of whether media and/or other types
blank         | 
text          | of activities could help foster this type of joint learning. There may be obstacles, for
blank         | 
text          | example, parents’ feelings about being less proficient in the language than their children.
blank         | 
text          | However, this study suggests that parents seek out resources including media to learn
blank         | 
text          | English at home, which allows them to study at their own pace and in accordance with
blank         | 
text          | their busy schedules. At the same time, children also enjoy various types of media
blank         | 
text          | content and media can be an activity parents and children enjoy at home together. Given
blank         | 
text          | these points, research might explore new avenues that could provide joint learning
blank         | 
text          | opportunities.

title         | Study Limitations
blank         | 
text          |        This study’s methods followed an ambitious design that combines ethnographic
blank         | 
text          | and quantitative data, including a tablet intervention. In all of these multiple facets, there
blank         | 
text          | are several limitations.

              | 	  
text          |        First, with regard to generalizability, due to the in-depth nature of this research,
blank         | 
text          | the sample size is small and findings can obviously not be generalized to the broader
blank         | 
text          | population. In addition, the cases represented in this study do not reflect the full diversity
blank         | 
text          | of Hispanic-Latino immigrant families. They are all residents of an urban community in
blank         | 
text          | a particular geographic region (Northern California), which does not necessarily reflect
blank         | 
text          | particular conditions of suburban or rural communities. It could be that as residents of
blank         | 
text          | the San Francisco Bay Area, a center of technology enterprise, families were more
blank         | 
text          | exposed to certain aspects of technology than those in other parts of the country.
blank         | 
text          | Whether location influenced families’ technology use is difficult to determine, however
blank         | 
text          | one might also speculate that even if certain technologies were adopted earlier in the Bay
blank         | 
text          | Area, we might expect to see similar patterns emerging in other locations as those
blank         | 
text          | technologies become more ubiquitous in the nation.
blank         | 
text          |        Limitations in terms of sampling also stem from the recruitment strategy.
blank         | 
text          | Families in this study were recruited through community-based organizations that work
blank         | 
text          | with parents and provide parent education. It is unclear how participants in these
blank         | 
text          | organizations’ programs may have differed from the general population. One could
blank         | 
text          | argue that recruiting by way of these programs contributed to selecting for particularly
blank         | 
text          | engaged/motivated families, or those who were more aware of services. Families were
blank         | 
text          | also all interested in owning an iPad (effect of the material incentive for participation).
blank         | 
text          |        While the AppStat program installed on the iPads allowed for a unique
blank         | 
text          | opportunity to quantify families’ app use on their tablets, it also brought a set of
blank         | 
text          | limitations. Who was using the apps, what particular functions participants used within
blank         | 
text          | each app and how they used them were not clear from the AppStat reports. Although I

              | 
              |

text          | addressed this issue by asking family members about how they used the apps that the
blank         | 
text          | reports said they used, it was not possible to do this for every one of the dozens of apps
blank         | 
text          | they had spent time with. Also, certain programs such as YouTube had a wide variety of
blank         | 
text          | uses from listening to music to watching cartoons to accessing instructional videos of all
blank         | 
text          | types and as family members answered my questions they likely did not cover all of the
blank         | 
text          | content accessed.
blank         | 
text          |        There were also limitations in terms of what data could feasibly be collected
blank         | 
text          | during the limited time spent with families. Due to each family’s unique schedule
blank         | 
text          | constraints, observation times could not be uniform across families or cover all possible
blank         | 
text          | times of day, as some families only had particular days and times available for visits. For
blank         | 
text          | these families I had to rely on interviews to inform about other parts of the day. For
blank         | 
text          | example, some students completed their homework while at after school programs and
blank         | 
text          | some completed it at home during visits. Thus it was not always possible to compare
blank         | 
text          | how the same media activities looked across different families, because not all activities
blank         | 
text          | families engaged in were observable during visits. On a related note, it is a challenge to
blank         | 
text          | attempt to observe “normal” daily activities, as the presence of the research may affect in
blank         | 
text          | any number of ways the media activity at hand. I cannot accurately gauge participants’
blank         | 
text          | desire to please me or to appear a certain way in my presence. However, six months (13-
blank         | 
text          | 14 observations) allowed for multiple opportunities during which to document a wealth
blank         | 
text          | of diverse examples, and gave families a chance to become accustomed to the visits.

title         | Conclusion
blank         | 
text          |        In the sections above, I have offered six findings that include practical
blank         | 
text          | implications for education practice and design. Based on these data, I argue that media
blank         | 
text          | can facilitate and provide significant language and literacy experiences in case families’
blank         | 
text          | lives. As an overarching theoretical contribution and implication of this study, I assert
blank         | 
text          | that media presents an opportunity to support families in their language and literacy
blank         | 
text          | learning, and merits further research to understand more precisely what and how learning
blank         | 
text          | is taking place.
blank         | 
text          |        I would like to end by emphasizing how the data presented in this dissertation
blank         | 
text          | serve to undermine “deficit” frames (Reissman, 1962) for approaching low-income, non-
blank         | 
text          | dominant groups as well as concepts of a widespread “culture of poverty” (Lewis, 1975).
blank         | 
text          | Instead this study supports the many rebuttals of such claims (e.g. Gorski, 2008; Valdés,
blank         | 
text          | 1996). Each family member in this study drew upon their own unique background and
blank         | 
text          | experience, which varied widely even between spouses in the same family, and brought
blank         | 
text          | these to bear on his or her technology activities. As shown, media and technology offer
blank         | 
text          | powerful ways to further learning both in- and out-of-school. If we design for the
blank         | 
text          | diversity of learners that exists we will move further toward realizing this potential.

              |                 aplicaciones instalados. La meta de esta parte del estudio es entender los
              |                 aspectos del iPad las familias encuentren útiles y/o divertidos, y por que. Por eso,
              |                 por favor solo úsenlo de la forma que deseen y disfruten. Por favor no usen el
              |                 iPad si el motivo es solo para “ayudar” con el estudio.

              |                 familia.xxxxx@gmail.com. También he criado una contraseña para su cuenta que
              |                 es relacionada a su dirección: 123Main. Esta contraseña puede ser cambiada a
              |                 cualquier momento en su cuenta de Apple, para su privacidad.
blank         |

              |                 1. Cual es el nombre de pila de su mejor amigo en el colegio? R: __________
              |                 2. Cómo le llamaban a Usted en su infancia? R: _________

              |                 opciones de pago:
blank         | 
text          |                        1. comprar una tarjeta de regalo de la Apple (de cualquier valor) e

              |                        3. Siempre que alguien intenta comprar una aplicación con el iPad, el
              |                           aparato va a pedir la contraseña (pero si acaba de comprar uno y sigue

blank         | 
text          |        -­‐   El aplicativo “AppStats” es una herramienta que graba los el tiempo de uso de
              |              cada aplicativo. Entonces si el aplicativo YouTube es usado por 30 minutos, esa
              |              información será grabada en el aplicativo. El aplicativo NO GRABA el contenido,
              |              solo el tiempo de uso. No graba nada de lo que Usted escribe o de la forma en
              |              que Usted usa los aplicativos. Cuando encerramos el estudio, puedo borrar ese
              |              aplicativo si la familia desea.

text          |        survey. As discussed in Chapter Two, leveraging the nationwide sample of responses
blank         | 
text          |        from the Families and Media Survey provides a unique opportunity to situate case
blank         |

blank         | 
text          |        several measures to the larger population. The Families and Media survey distribution
blank         | 
text          |        included a Hispanic-Latino oversample (n=682), supported by the LIFE Center, in order
blank         | 
text          |        to provide more robust data on how Hispanic-Latino families in particular are accessing

text          |        and using media.

blank         | 
text          |        that the everyday language spoken in their home was “mostly another language and
blank         | 
text          |        some English” (n=230) or “only a language other than English” (n=73).23 In the case

text          |        family sample, six of seven families indicated they spoke “only” Spanish at home, and
blank         | 
text          |        the remaining parent (Rebeca Rivera) indicated they spoke “mostly” Spanish (her two
blank         | 
text          |        daughters sometimes spoke English with one another). Although primary home

text          |   To confirm that parents who identified as Hispanic-Latino and spoke a language other than Spanish at
              | home were actually Spanish-speaking (as opposed to speakers of a language other than Spanish), I
              | examined the “Language dominance” variable that was recorded by the GfK pre-survey. And among those
              | who indicated that they spoke mostly or only a language other than English at home, 73.6 per cent
              | indicated they were “Spanish-dominant.” An additional 19.5 per cent indicated they were “bilingual,” while
              | 1.6 per cent reported they were “English-dominant” and 5.3 per cent indicated “non-hispanic” (what this
              | variable represents is unclear). Thus, although the survey did not ask parents to specify whether the
              | language spoken at home was in fact Spanish, 93.1 per cent of parents in this group indicated they were
              | Spanish-dominant or equally dominant in English and Spanish, with the large majority falling in the former
              | category.

blank         | 
text          |        primary home language). In this section, I provide simple analyses of a limited selection

blank         | 
text          |        roughly 20 per cent of both groups (mostly Spanish and only Spanish) in the nationwide
blank         | 
text          |        sample reported earning more than $49,000 per year (2.2 per cent of the “mostly”

blank         | 
text          |        per year). In comparison, six of the seven case families reported an income of $25,000
blank         | 
text          |        or less, with the Orozco family reporting between $45,000 and $49,000 annual income
blank         | 
text          |        (with both parents working full time). The nationwide sample also included parents who

blank         |

blank         | 
text          |        study and the nationwide sample suggests that case families had more Internet access
blank         | 
text          |        and owned smartphones at a higher rate than average across the U.S. In the nationwide
blank         | 
text          |        sub-sample, television was virtually ubiquitous and roughly 60 per cent have cable or
blank         | 
text          |        satellite television. E-readers and educational game devices were the least prevalent.
blank         | 
text          |        These patterns were roughly reflected in the group of case families overall – five of the
blank         | 
text          |        seven had cable or satellite TV, two families had educational game devices and none had
blank         | 
text          |        e-readers. However, in terms of high-speed Internet, in the nationwide sample only
blank         | 
text          |        about sixty per cent of the “mostly” Spanish group and forty per cent of the “only”
blank         | 
text          |        Spanish group had this access at home. Among the case families, five out of seven had
blank         | 
text          |        high speed Internet. In addition, parents in case families all had smartphones, whereas
blank         | 
text          |        in the nationwide sample only 50 per cent of all families had smartphones. In addition,
blank         | 
text          |        while the nationwide group had a wider range of income levels and income was
blank         | 
text          |        associated with more devices and access, the group of case families overall had more
blank         | 
text          |        technology even though their income was low. One possible explanation for case
blank         | 
text          |        families having more of some types of devices and access is that they were residing in
blank         |

blank         | 
text          |        shown on Table 3d, parents from three case families (Érica Martínez, Lorena Aguirre
blank         |

blank         | 
text          |        Rebeca Rivera and Karina Parra reported “several times a week”). Natalia Acosta’s
blank         | 
text          |        response to this item was several times per month, while Sara Morales responded “less
blank         |

blank         |

blank         | 
text          |        Internet to learn something new at least once a week. It is perhaps logical that the two

blank         | 
text          |        based on pilot and ethnographic research (Barron et al, in preparation). In the case
blank         | 
text          |        sample, all surveyed parents indicated “sometimes” or “often” for all items, except in
blank         | 
text          |        two cases. Lorena Aguirre indicated that her son Eduardo (the focal child for the
blank         | 
text          |        survey) rarely asked to do a project or activity based on educational media – although
blank         | 
text          |        she noted that her older daughter Naomi did so more frequently. Érica Martínez
blank         | 
text          |        indicated that her younger son David rarely engaged in imaginative play based on
blank         | 
text          |        educational media. Parents’ overall response (“sometimes” or “often” for in nearly all
blank         | 
text          |        cases) reflects the majority of responses from the nationwide group (52 to 92 per cent of
blank         | 
text          |        parents on each item also responded this way), however a closer analysis would be
blank         | 
text          |        necessary to determine how much individual respondents’ choices varied across the four

text          |        parents about how often their child taught them something they didn’t know based on
blank         | 
text          |        media content, and how much they felt media had helped their child learn English. In

text          |        speaking homes more likely to say media had helped their child learn English
blank         | 
text          |        (approximately 90 per cent of parents responded “sometimes” or “often,” as compared
blank         | 
text          |        to 70 per cent in the “mostly English” group), they also were more likely to say that their
blank         | 
text          |        children taught them new things based on media (approximately 85 per cent of parents
blank         | 
text          |        in the Spanish-speaking group versus 60 per cent in the English-speaking group). This

blank         |

text          |                Focusing in on “reading or vocabulary” learning, which speaks most directly to
blank         | 
text          |        the research questions in the present study, the data suggests that in parents’ view, this
blank         | 
text          |        domain was the one in which children learned most overall from educational media.
blank         | 
text          |        Table 3o, below, shows the case families’ responses regarding reading and vocabulary
blank         | 
text          |        learning from educational media on the four platforms (N/A indicating that the child did
blank         | 
text          |        not use educational media on this platform at least once a week or that the family did not
blank         | 
text          |        have this device). As shown, all case parents felt that their children had learned about
blank         | 
text          |        reading or vocabulary from educational media on at least two different platforms. All
blank         | 
text          |        parents felt their children had learned either “some” or “a lot” in this domain from
blank         | 
text          |        educational television or DVDs. Six out of seven parents felt their children had learned
blank         | 
text          |        “some” or “a lot” about reading and vocabulary from using educational media on mobile
blank         | 
text          |        devices such as smartphones. For the five families who said their children used
blank         | 
text          |        educational media on a computer at least once a week (all five families who had access
blank         | 
text          |        to a working computer), parents also answered “some” or “a lot.” Perception of reading
blank         | 
text          |        and vocabulary learning from video games on consoles or handheld devices was much
blank         | 
text          |        less prevalent and was also the platform that fewest families used. Six out of seven

text          |        families indicated that their child had learned “a lot” about reading or vocabulary from
blank         | 
text          |        at least one platform. In general, parents in case families held the view that educational
blank         | 
text          |        media had contributed to their children’s reading and/or vocabulary learning, and this

text          |                To summarize, this appendix attempts to highlight both the diversity and the
blank         | 
text          |        common threads between case families, and provide a basic sense of how these seven
blank         | 
text          |        families may resemble or differ from other Hispanic-Latino, Spanish-speaking parents
blank         | 
text          |        nationwide in terms of their responses to survey items. The case portraits provide
blank         | 
text          |        detailed and nuanced descriptions of families that introduce some of their characteristics,
blank         | 
text          |        routines, values and challenges, which vary widely between families but include strong
blank         | 
text          |        commonalities including the high value placed on children’s education and efforts by
blank         | 
text          |        parents to support their children’s schooling. The comparisons of survey data show that
blank         | 
text          |        case families – who are lower income due to selection criteria than the overall
blank         | 
text          |        nationwide sample, reflect the diversity of the nationwide group in many aspects such as
blank         | 
text          |        parent education level and frequency of educational media sparking learning-related
blank         | 
text          |        activities. In terms of device ownership and access, families in the case sample were

blank         | 
text          |        about half of parents in the nationwide group did. Case parents also reflected a range of
blank         | 
text          |        responses as to how often they sought new information via the Internet, however all
blank         | 
text          |        parents in the case sample did this at least from time to time, whereas among parents
blank         | 
text          |        who indicated their families spoke only Spanish at home, 20 per cent said that they
blank         | 
text          |        “never” did. In sum, on the items analyzed here, the case sample reflects a diverse range
blank         | 
text          |        of responses that – in most ways – echoes those of nationwide Hispanic-Latino parents
blank         | 
text          |        who also spoke mostly or only Spanish at home.
