blank         | 
text          |        Eukaryotic chromosomes segregate by attaching to microtubules of the mitotic
blank         | 
text          | spindle through a chromosomal microtubule-binding site called the kinetochore.
blank         | 
text          | Kinetochores assemble on a specialized chromosomal locus termed the centromere,
blank         | 
text          | characterized by the replacement of histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes with the
blank         | 
text          | essential histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A). CENP-A nucleosomes
blank         | 
text          | are believed to epigenetically specify centromere identity, thus understanding how
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A chromatin is assembled and maintained is central to understanding
blank         | 
text          | chromosome segregation mechanisms. CENP-A nucleosome assembly requires the
blank         | 
text          | Mis18 complex and the CENP-A chaperone HJURP. HJURP binds to pre-
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomal CENP-A and facilitates the deposition of new CENP-A nucleosomes into
blank         | 
text          | centromeric chromatin. The mechanistic roles of the Mis18 complex in CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | assembly and maintenance are not well understood. The Mis18 complex and HJURP
blank         | 
text          | localize to centromeres in telophase/G1, when new CENP-A chromatin is assembled.
blank         | 
text          | The molecular interactions that control their targeting are unknown. Several
blank         | 
text          | constitutive centromere proteins that remain associated with CENP-A chromatin
blank         | 
text          | throughout the cell cycle have also been implicated in CENP-A assembly, including
blank         | 
text          | CENP-C. Their functions in CENP-A assembly are unknown.
blank         | 
text          |        The first chapter of this thesis work describes the development of an in vitro
blank         | 
text          | system for centromeric chromatin assembly in Xenopus laevis egg extracts. We show
blank         | 
text          | that CENP-A assembly in extract recapitulates the cell cycle dependence and HJURP
blank         | 
text          | requirement of CENP-A assembly in somatic cells. We then use this in vitro system to
blank         | 
text          | identify a novel role for CENP-C in recruiting CENP-A assembly factors to the

text          | centromere to promote CENP-A assembly, described in Chapter 2. We show that
blank         | 
text          | CENP-C is required to target the Mis18 complex protein M18BP1 to Xenopus sperm
blank         | 
text          | centromeres in metaphase. In the absence of CENP-C, M18BP1 and HJURP targeting
blank         | 
text          | to centromeres is disrupted and new CENP-A assembly into centromeric chromatin is
blank         | 
text          | inhibited. We find that CENP-C interacts directly with M18BP1 through conserved
blank         | 
text          | domains in the CENP-C protein. Thus, CENP-C provides a link between existing
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A chromatin and the proteins required for new CENP-A nucleosome assembly.
blank         | 
text          |        Overall, this work extends our mechanistic understanding of how the pre-
blank         | 
text          | existing centromere directs the local assembly of new CENP-A nucleosomes to ensure
blank         | 
text          | stable propagation of the centromere. Furthermore, the ability to assemble centromeric
blank         | 
text          | chromatin in vitro will provide a valuable tool for dissecting the biochemical and cell
blank         | 
text          | cycle regulatory mechanisms that control new CENP-A assembly and ensure faithful
blank         | 
text          | centromere propagation.

text          | scientific colleagues and friends. I want to especially thank Ben Moree, who taught me
blank         | 
text          | how to make extracts and who did far more than his fair share of frog injections over
blank         | 
text          | the past two years. I am grateful to have had him as a collaborator on this project; our
blank         | 
text          | spirited scientific discussions were fun and made this work stronger. I also thank Ben
blank         | 
text          | for re-introducing me to the joys of meat-eating, in particular his pulled pork and
blank         | 
text          | anything with bacon. I am profoundly grateful to Colin Fuller for always being
blank         | 
text          | available when I needed an “assist” with computer or experimental issues, and for
blank         | 
text          | many stimulating discussions about the merits of various gluten-free flours. Thanks to

blank         | 
text          | thanks to former Straight lab member Kristina Godek, who taught me how to purify
blank         | 
text          | proteins and who was very generous with her time when I first joined the lab. Finally,
blank         | 
text          | I am extremely grateful to Aaron Straight for serving as my advisor. His enthusiasm
blank         | 
text          | for experimental science is inspiring, and his optimism and faith in our abilities to
blank         | 
text          | make experiments work got me through the frustrating parts of this project. I thank
blank         | 
text          | him for pushing me to think about the “big picture” when planning experiments and
blank         | 
text          | interpreting data, and for teaching me how to effectively communicate our science to a
blank         | 
text          | larger audience.

text          | Accurate chromosome segregation depends on the mitotic kinetochore.
blank         | 
text          |        Cell division is a fundamental process during reproduction, development, and
blank         | 
text          | throughout the lifetime of an organism. One important aspect of cell division is
blank         | 
text          | propagation of the genetic material: each daughter cell inherits an exact copy of the
blank         | 
text          | parental genome. This involves two steps: first, DNA is faithfully replicated during S
blank         | 
text          | phase of the cell cycle, and second, replicated (‘sister’) chromosomes are equally
blank         | 
text          | partitioned between daughter cells during mitosis. Mistakes in chromosome
blank         | 
text          | segregation lead to the loss or gain of genetic material (aneuploidy), which is
blank         | 
text          | detrimental on both the cellular and organismal level. Aneuploidy is the leading
blank         | 
text          | known cause of pregnancy loss, and for those pregnancies that survive to term, the
blank         | 
text          | primary genetic cause of developmental disabilities and mental retardation (Hassold
blank         | 
text          | and Hunt, 2001). Furthermore, aneuploidy is a common characteristic of human
blank         | 
text          | cancers and is correlated with poor prognosis (Weaver and Cleveland, 2006).
blank         | 
text          | Experimentally, aneuploidy has been shown to promote tumorigenesis (Weaver and
blank         | 
text          | Cleveland, 2009; Weaver et al., 2007) or cause embryonic lethality (Williams et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2008) in some mouse models. Consequently, cells have evolved stringent mechanisms
blank         | 
text          | for regulating chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis.
blank         | 
text          |        Chromosome segregation is mediated by a proteinacious structure called the
blank         | 
text          | kinetochore, which assembles at a single site on each chromosome during mitosis. The
blank         | 
text          | kinetochore serves as the primary attachment site for microtubules of the mitotic
blank         | 
text          | spindle and couples spindle forces to chromosome movement during anaphase. The
blank         | 
text          | kinetochore also mediates the spindle assembly checkpoint, which delays anaphase
blank         | 
text          | onset until all sister chromosomes are attached to opposite poles of the spindle, thus

blank         | 
text          | (reviewed in (Cheeseman and Desai, 2008)). The kinetochore assembles on a
blank         | 
text          | specialized chromatin domain called the centromere.

text          | The centromere is a specialized chromatin domain that serves as the site of

text          | mitotic kinetochore assembly.
blank         | 
text          |        The centromere was first defined cytologically, as the primary constriction
blank         | 
text          | point of paired mitotic chromosomes. On a molecular level, a collection of ~20
blank         | 
text          | proteins called the constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) remain
blank         | 
text          | associated with this locus throughout the cell cycle and serve as the platform for
blank         | 
text          | mitotic kinetochore assembly. Mutation or loss of proteins of the CCAN results in
blank         | 
text          | kinetochore formation defects and chromosome missegregation (Amano et al., 2009;
blank         | 
text          | Cheeseman et al., 2008; Foltz et al., 2006; Hori et al., 2008; McClelland et al., 2007).
blank         | 
text          | Thus, understanding how the centromere is formed is central to understanding
blank         | 
text          | chromosome segregation mechanisms.
blank         | 
text          |        In this introduction, I will first introduce the general structure and organization
blank         | 
text          | of chromatin, then I will discuss what makes centromeric chromatin distinctive. On a
blank         | 
text          | molecular level, a hallmark of centomeric chromatin is the replacement of histone H3
blank         | 
text          | with the centromere-specific histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A) in
blank         | 
text          | centromeric nucleosomes (Palmer et al., 1991; Palmer et al., 1987; Sullivan et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 1994). I will present evidence suggesting that CENP-A nucleosomes epigenetically
blank         | 
text          | specify centromere identity, then I will end with a discussion on the molecular
blank         |

text          |         To fit about two meters of DNA into a nucleus that is merely ten to twenty
blank         | 
text          | microns in diameter, eukaryotic cells ‘package’ their DNA into chromatin fibers
blank         | 
text          | (Annunziato, 2008). The basic unit of chromatin is a protein-DNA complex called the
blank         | 
text          | nucleosome, which can be visualized as the ‘bead’ component of the ‘beads on a string’
blank         | 
text          | structure adopted by chromatin extracted from cells under conditions that cause it to
blank         | 
text          | unravel ((Olins and Olins, 1974; Olins and Olins, 2003), Figure 1A). The protein
blank         | 
text          | components of nucleosomes are histones, a family of small, positively charged
blank         | 
text          | proteins with unstructured N-terminal tails followed by a conserved histone fold
blank         | 
text          | domain (HFD). The ‘canonical’ histones, which comprise the bulk of histones found
blank         | 
text          | within chromatin, are termed H2A, H2B, H3, and H4; in solution, these proteins exist
blank         | 
text          | as H2A-H2B dimers and H3-H4 tetramers. To form a nucleosome, two copies of each
blank         | 
text          | histone protein form a compact histone octamer that is wrapped 1.65 times by a left-
blank         | 
text          | handed DNA superhelix 146 base pairs in length (Luger et al., 1997) (Figure 1b). The
blank         | 
text          | histone HFDs mediate histone-histone interactions and histone-DNA interactions that
blank         | 
text          | drive formation of the histone octamer and the nucleosome, and the histone N-terminal
blank         | 
text          | tails protrude from the nucleosome core particle. The histone tails are highly basic and
blank         | 
text          | are substrates for a variety of post-translational modifications that affect chromatin

text          | (Annunziato, 2008). The packaging of DNA into arrays of nucleosomes compacts the
blank         | 
text          | DNA approximately seven-fold. However, during mitosis, when chromosomes are in
blank         | 
text          | their most compacted state, the DNA is approximately 10,000-fold more compact than
blank         | 
text          | in its linear form (Annunziato, 2008). Thus, to achieve additional compaction,
blank         | 
text          | nucleosome arrays are folded into higher-order structures, which are poorly
blank         | 
text          | understood at a structural level ((Annunziato, 2008; Felsenfeld and Groudine, 2003)).
blank         | 
text          |        In addition to facilitating compaction of the DNA, the formation of
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes allows for the specialization of specific chromosomal regions. For
blank         | 
text          | example, nucleosome modifications can mark chromosomal loci as transcriptionally
blank         | 
text          | active, transcriptionally silent, or in need of DNA repair. Additionally, specific regions
blank         | 
text          | of chromatin, such as the centromere, can direct the assembly of protein complexes
blank         | 
text          | (the kinetochore) that regulate whole chromosome behaviors (chromosome
blank         | 
text          | segregation). In general, chromatin is specialized in two ways, through post-
blank         | 
text          | translational modification (PTMs) of the histone tails and through replacement of
blank         | 
text          | conventional histones with histone variants. Common PTMs include methylation,
blank         | 
text          | acetylation, and phosphorylation (reviewed in (Kouzarides, 2007)), and histone
blank         | 
text          | variants for H2A, H2B, and H3 have been discovered (reviewed in (Bernstein and
blank         | 
text          | Hake, 2006)). Both PTMs and histone variants can affect intra- and inter-nucleosomal
blank         | 
text          | contacts, thus influencing nucleosome and higher-order chromatin structures
blank         | 
text          | (reviewed in (Bernstein and Hake, 2006; Kouzarides, 2007). Additionally, PTMs can
blank         | 
text          | recruit effector proteins that modulate chromatin structure and function (reviewed in
blank         | 
text          | (Bernstein and Hake, 2006; Kouzarides, 2007)). Histone variants, through sequence

text          | that the overall structure of centromeric and canonical nucleosomes was likely to be
blank         | 
text          | similar (Yoda et al., 2000). The crystal structure of the CENP-A nucleosome was
blank         | 
text          | recently solved, confirming this prediction (Figure 1C). The CENP-A nucleosome is a
blank         | 
text          | histone octamer made up of two copies each of the histones H2A, H2B, CENP-A, and
blank         | 
text          | H4, wrapped by DNA in a left-handed manner. Furthermore, SAXS measurements
blank         | 
text          | showed that the global structures of CENP-A and H3 nucleosomes are quite similar
blank         | 
text          | (Tachiwana et al., 2011). One notable difference is that only the central 121 base pairs
blank         | 
text          | of DNA are visible in the CENP-A nucleosome crystal structure (compared to 146
blank         | 
text          | base pairs in the H3 nucleosome structure), indicating that 13 base pairs on either end
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | Kingston et al., 2011). Another notable difference is that CENP-A contains two extra
blank         | 
text          | amino acids in the loop 1 region within the histone fold domain, which protrude from
blank         | 
text          | the nucleosome core particle and are solvent accessible (Tachiwana et al., 2011). The
blank         | 
text          | authors speculated that this might provide a CENP-A-specific protein-protein
blank         | 
text          | interaction surface that could contribute to the exclusive localization of CENP-A at

blank         | 
text          |          Several alternative models for the structure of the centromeric nucleosome
blank         | 
text          | have been proposed, that differ from the crystal structure with respect to the protein
blank         | 
text          | composition of the nucleosome and the directionality of the DNA wrapped around the
blank         | 
text          | nucleosome core particle. However, it is important to note that many biochemical

text          | experiments using CENP-A nucleosomes reconstituted from human or budding yeast
blank         | 
text          | proteins also suggest that the histone protein complex is octameric and that it is
blank         | 
text          | wrapped by a left-handed DNA superhelix (Camahort et al., 2009; Conde e Silva et al.,
blank         |

text          |          The most controversial proposal is that the protein core of centromeric

text          | nucleosomes is a histone tetramer, comprised of one copy of each of histones H2A,
blank         | 
text          | H2B, CENP-A, and H4 – the so-called ‘hemisome’ model. Specifically, primary

text          | histone protein. In support of this model, atomic force microscopy (AFM)
blank         | 
text          | measurements of immunoprecipitated chromatin showed that the height of CID
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes was roughly half that of nucleosomes within bulk chromatin (Dalal et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2007). Similar AFM observations were recently made using chromatin prepared from
blank         | 
text          | asynchronous HeLa cells, leading the authors to propose that hemisomes are present
blank         | 
text          | within human centromeres as well (Dimitriadis et al., 2010). However, several groups
blank         | 
text          | have shown that when epitope-tagged CENP-A is expressed in cells and
blank         | 
text          | immunoprecipitated from extensively digested chromatin, it is associated with
blank         | 
text          | endogenous CENPA. This suggests that multiple CENP-A proteins, e.g. both epitope-
blank         | 
text          | tagged and endogenous, are present within the same nucleosome (Erhardt et al., 2008;
blank         | 
text          | Shelby et al., 1997; Xiao et al., 2011). At present, it is not clear whether these
blank         | 
text          | conflicting results reflect differences in experimental methodology, or whether the
blank         | 
text          | hemisome and the octasome represent real differences in centromeric nucleosome
blank         | 
text          | structure between species and/or cell cycle states. One limitation to the in vivo
blank         | 
text          | crosslinking approach used in Drosophila is that CID lacks lysine residues within the
blank         | 
text          | region predicted to hold the two tetrameric “halves” of the nucleosome together
blank         | 
text          | (which are present in H3) (Black and Bassett, 2008). This raises the possibility that
blank         | 
text          | hemisomes were recovered during immunoprecipitations because of inefficient
blank         | 
text          | crosslinking, which is consistent with the observation that CENP-A nucleosomes are
blank         | 
text          | more easily disassembled than H3 nucleosomes in vitro (Conde e Silva et al., 2007).
blank         | 
text          | But, immunoprecipitation data showing a ‘homotypic’ association between epitope-
blank         | 
text          | tagged and endogenous CENP-A must also be interpreted cautiously, as digested
blank         |

text          | nucleosome arrays (e.g. di- and tri-nucleosomes). Thus, it is possible that epitope-
blank         | 
text          | tagged CENP-A and endogenous CENP-A were present in adjacent nucleosomes
blank         | 
text          | rather than within the same nucleosome.
blank         | 
text          |        Another controversial aspect of the hemisome model is that centromeric
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes are wrapped by DNA in a right-handed manner (Furuyama, 2006). In
blank         | 
text          | vitro reconstitution of CID (Drosophila CENP-A) nucleosomes using the histone
blank         | 
text          | chaperone protein Rbap48 introduced positive supercoils into a plasmid, whereas
blank         | 
text          | reconstitution of H3 nucleosomes under the same conditions introduced negative
blank         | 
text          | supercoils. In addition, the effect of centromeric nucleosome assembly on plasmid
blank         | 
text          | topology in vivo was investigated using budding yeast. Similar to their in vitro results,
blank         | 
text          | the authors found that assembly of Cse4 (budding yeast CENP-A, Table 1)
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes introduced positive supercoils into a plasmid. Given that conventional
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes are wrapped by DNA in a left-handed manner, the authors asserted that
blank         | 
text          | right-handed DNA wrapping is structurally compatible with a tetrameric nucleosome
blank         | 
text          | but not with an octameric nucleosome (Furuyama, 2006). It is important to note that
blank         | 
text          | the authors used an unconventional nucleosome reconstitution method for their in vitro
blank         | 
text          | experiments, which can influence the structure of the reconstituted product (Furuyama
blank         | 
text          | and Henikoff, 2009). Furthermore, the mutations they used to manipulate Cse4
blank         | 
text          | nucleosome assembly in budding yeast experiments also disrupted assembly of other
blank         | 
text          | centromere proteins; thus, it is possible that plasmid topology differences were caused
blank         | 
text          | by the loss of Cse4-associated proteins rather than Cse4 itself (Hegemann et al., 1988;
blank         | 
text          | McGrew et al., 1986; Ortiz et al., 1999; Pearson et al., 2003). Thus, further

blank         | 
text          | relevant in vivo.
blank         | 
text          |        In budding yeast, it has been proposed that the nonhistone protein Scm3
blank         | 
text          | replaces H2A and H2B at the centromere to form a unique hexameric nucleosome,
blank         | 
text          | with two copies each of Scm3, Cse4, and H4 (Mizuguchi et al., 2007; Xiao et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2011). Scm3 is required for Cse4 localization to the centromere (Camahort et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2007; Mizuguchi et al., 2007; Stoler et al., 2007), and its role in Cse4 nucleosome
blank         | 
text          | assembly will be discussed later (see “Scm3/HJURP: CENP-A chaperone”). The
blank         | 
text          | ‘hexameric nucleosome’ model stemmed from the observation that Scm3 localizes to
blank         | 
text          | centromeric DNA sequences throughout the cell cycle, whereas H3 and H2B are
blank         | 
text          | absent (Mizuguchi et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2011). Recently, it was shown that
blank         | 
text          | centromeric DNA sequences are refractory to reconstitution of octameric Cse4
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes in vitro but support the assembly of Scm3-Cse4-H4-DNA complexes,
blank         | 
text          | presumed to contain two copies of each protein based on the electrophoretic mobility
blank         | 
text          | shift of the complex. Resistance to octameric nucleosome reconstitution was mediated
blank         | 
text          | by a specific centromere sequence element (CDEII, discussed below), as replacement
blank         | 
text          | of this element with an equivalent length of non-centromeric sequence significantly
blank         | 
text          | increased the efficiency of octameric nucleosome reconstitution. In conflict with the
blank         | 
text          | hexameric nucleosome model, one group detected an association between Cse4 and
blank         | 
text          | H2B but not between Cse4 and Scm3 within solubilized chromatin (Camahort et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2009). Furthermore, overexpression of Cse4 rescued the lethality of an Scm3 deletion,
blank         | 
text          | indicating that an Scm3-Cse4-H4 nucleosome is not essential (Camahort et al., 2009).
blank         | 
text          | Interestingly, Xiao et al. reported that reconstitution of octameric Cse4 nucleosomes

blank         | 
text          | versus 4°C) (Xiao et al., 2011). Thus, it is possible that the structure of the budding
blank         | 
text          | yeast Cse4 nucleosome is flexible in vivo. Camahort et al. observed low levels of Cse4
blank         | 
text          | at non-centromeric loci (Camahort et al., 2009), which could be in the form of
blank         | 
text          | octameric nucleosomes. If so, it will be interesting to determine whether and how
blank         | 
text          | nucleosome structure influences kinetochore formation and removal of mis-

text          |        Unlike the so-called ‘point centromeres’ of budding yeast, centromeres in
blank         | 
text          | fission yeast and most higher eukaryotes are comprised of many CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes spanning a long stretch of repetitive DNA, referred to as ‘regional’
blank         | 
text          | centromeres. Interestingly, both the length and the base pair composition of
blank         | 
text          | centromeric DNA sequences are extremely divergent between species. The simplest
blank         | 
text          | regional centromere, that of the fission yeast Saccharomyces pombe, spans 40-100 kb
blank         | 
text          | of DNA. Each centromere locus contains a 4-7 kb non-repetitive central sequence
blank         | 
text          | (cnt) flanked by centromere-specific innermost repeat sequences (imr), which together
blank         | 
text          | form the site for Cnp1 (fission yeast CENP-A, Table 1) nucleosome assembly. This
blank         | 
text          | central domain is flanked by long tandem arrays of outer repeat sequences (otr), which
blank         | 
text          | are heterochromatic (discussed further below) (reviewed in (Carroll and Straight,
blank         | 
text          | 2006)). In contrast, human centromeres are assembled on arrays of a tandemly
blank         | 
text          | repeated 171 base pair sequence element called α-satellite, ranging from 0.5 to 1.5
blank         | 
text          | Mbp in length (reviewed in (Carroll and Straight, 2006)). An additional feature of
blank         | 
text          | human centromeric DNA is a 17 base pair sequence element called the CENP-B box,
blank         |

text          |        Originally, it was thought that the repetitive DNA sequences characteristic of

text          | to CEN DNA sequences in budding yeast. In support of this model, experiments in
blank         | 
text          | fission yeast and cultured human cells showed that centromeric DNA sequences

text          | promote de novo centromere formation. Specifically, plasmids containing S. pombe

text          | centromere DNA sequences were mitotically and meiotically stable when introduced

blank         | 
text          | The role of α-satellite sequences in centromere specification has also been challenged,
blank         | 
text          | by the discovery of two types of unconventional centromere configurations:
blank         | 
text          | neocentromeres and pseudo-dicentric chromosomes. Pseudodicentric chromosomes
blank         | 
text          | contain two discrete regions of α-satellite DNA but are stably maintained because only
blank         | 
text          | one of the α-satellite loci forms an active centromere, illustrating that the presence of
blank         | 
text          | α-satellite DNA does not guarantee centromere formation. The fact that centromeric
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes only occupy one-half to two-thirds of the α-satellite-containing region on
blank         | 
text          | a given chromosome underscores this point (Schueler and Sullivan, 2006). Notably,
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A is only recruited to the active centromere, while CENP-B is recruited to both
blank         | 
text          | α-satellite loci, consistent with its sequence-specific DNA binding activity. (Earnshaw
blank         | 
text          | et al., 1989; Sullivan and Schwartz, 1995; Warburton et al., 1997). Neocentromeres
blank         | 
text          | are functional centromeres that have formed on non-alphoid DNA sequences, to
blank         | 
text          | rescue acentric DNA fragments created during unusual chromosome breakage or
blank         | 
text          | rearrangement events. (Barry et al., 1999; Marshall et al., 2008; Voullaire et al., 1993).
blank         | 
text          | Neocentromeres recruit all centromere and kinetochore proteins that have been tested

text          | (except CENP-B) and behave identically to alphoid centromeres during mitosis and

blank         | 
text          | (Craig et al., 2003; Marshall et al., 2008; Saffery et al., 2000). The existence of stable

text          | dicentric chromosomes and neocentromeres demonstrates that DNA sequence is not

text          | the primary determinant of centromere identity, though specific DNA sequences may

blank         | 
text          |        CENP-A is a prime candidate for the epigenetic mark that establishes and
blank         | 
text          | propagates centromere identity for the following reasons. First, though centromeric
blank         | 
text          | DNA sequences vary widely between species, all eukaryotic centromeres are marked
blank         | 
text          | by the incorporation of CENP-A nucleosomes. Second, mutation or loss of CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | leads to severe chromosome segregation defects in all eukaryotes (Allshire and Karpen,
blank         |

text          | et al., 2005; Takahashi et al., 2000). Surprisingly, ectopic expression of Cse4 was able
blank         | 
text          | to rescue the CENP-A depletion phenotype in human cells, illustrating the functional
blank         | 
text          | conservation of CENP-A homologs across diverse species (Wieland et al., 2004).
blank         | 
text          | Third, CENP-A is required for the localization of most centromere and kinetochore
blank         | 
text          | proteins, but depletion of most centromere and kinetochore proteins has no effect on
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A targeting to the centromere, indicating that CENP-A lies at or near the top of
blank         | 
text          | the kinetochore formation pathway (Blower and Karpen, 2001; Collins et al., 2005;
blank         | 
text          | Liu et al., 2006; Oegema et al., 2001; Regnier et al., 2005). Finally, mislocalization of
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A led to ectopic centromere formation in some species. Overexpression of CID
blank         | 
text          | in Drosophila cultured cells led to CID misincorporation throughout chromosome

blank         | 
text          | the authors to conclude that CENP-A is not sufficient for neocentromere formation in
blank         | 
text          | humans. However, a later study was successful with a more directed approach:
blank         | 
text          | tethering the CENP-A chaperone protein HJURP to a specific euchromatic locus to
blank         | 
text          | create a single domain of ectopic CENP-A. A subset of euchromatic CENP-A loci
blank         | 
text          | recruited centromere and kinetochore proteins, formed cold-stable microtubule
blank         | 
text          | attachments, and caused chromosome segregation defects, indicating that functional
blank         | 
text          | kinetochores had formed (Barnhart et al., 2011). The latter study suggests that CENP-
blank         | 
text          | A is sufficient for neocentromere formation in humans as in Drosophila, and several
blank         | 
text          | explanations could account for the failure to observe ectopic kinetochore formation in
blank         | 
text          | the context of CENP-A overexpression. First, it is likely that other centromere and
blank         | 
text          | kinetochore proteins were limiting. The fact that the CCAN protein CENP-C was only
blank         | 
text          | recruited to ectopic CENP-A sites when expressed at higher-than-endogenous levels
blank         | 
text          | supports this interpretation (Gascoigne et al., 2011). Another possibility is that the
blank         | 
text          | overexpression studies didn’t reach a ‘threshold’ level of CENP-A needed for
blank         | 
text          | neocentromere formation at any one chromosomal locus. The idea of a CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | threshold is consistent with the observation that intermediate levels of CID
blank         | 
text          | overexpression in Drosophila cells, leading to ectopic localization of CID at sub-
blank         | 
text          | centromeric levels, did not cause cell growth or mitotic defects (Moreno-Moreno et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2006). Overall, it is clear that CENP-A plays a critical role in specifying and
blank         | 
text          | propagating centromere identity. Thus, understanding how CENP-A is assembled and
blank         | 
text          | maintained at centromeric chromatin is central to understanding chromosome

blank         | 
text          | Interestingly, alternating domains of CENP-A and H3 nucleosomes were also found at
blank         | 
text          | several human neocentromeres, suggesting that it is a general and important feature of
blank         | 
text          | centromere organization (Alonso et al., 2010; Chueh et al., 2005). Despite their linear
blank         | 
text          | proximity, CENP-A and H3 occupy spatially distinct regions within mitotic
blank         | 
text          | chromosomes. CENP-A nucleosomes are clustered on the poleward face of the mitotic

blank         | 
text          | (Blower et al., 2002; Sullivan and Karpen, 2004). The mechanisms that drive this

text          | reorganization, as well as the higher-order chromatin structure of the mitotic

text          | centromere, are poorly understood.
blank         | 
text          |        Several studies have shown that H3 nucleosomes within centromeric chromatin
blank         | 
text          | display a unique post-translational modification signature. Using Drosophila cells and
blank         | 
text          | HeLa cells, Sullivan et al. demonstrated that centromeric chromatin contains
blank         | 
text          | H3K4me2 nucleosomes, a modification associated with open but not actively

text          | transcribed chromatin. Marks characteristic of heterochromatin or actively transcribed

text          | and HAC centromeres. Surprisingly, H3K4me2 was found within the HAC
blank         | 
text          | centromere but not within endogenous centromeres (Bergmann et al., 2010). Within

text          | centrochromatin of chicken DT40 cells, H3K9me3, a mark characteristic of
blank         | 
text          | heterochromatin, was found in addition to H3K4me2 (Ribeiro et al., 2010). These

text          | somewhat conflicting results suggest that the post-translational modification signature

text          | can lead to the formation of ectopic kinetochores during mitosis. If multiple

blank         | 
text          | (Hemmerich et al., 2008; Jansen et al., 2007). During syncytial divisions of the
blank         | 
text          | Drosophila early embryo, CID is rapidly assembled during anaphase (Schuh et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2007), whereas in Drosophila somatic cells, CID is assembled during metaphase
blank         | 
text          | (Mellone et al., 2011). In Xenopus laevis egg extracts, CENP-A assembly begins after
blank         | 
text          | release of the extract from metaphase arrest (Bernad et al., 2011). The mechanisms
blank         | 
text          | that regulate the timing of CENP-A assembly are not well understood but are likely to
blank         | 
text          | comprise both activating signals during the assembly time window (e.g. telophase/G1
blank         | 
text          | in human cells) and inhibitory signals during other cell cycle states. Despite temporal

text          | differences between species and/or developmental stages, several common regulatory
blank         | 
text          | themes have emerged. In all systems, microtubule-generated tension during mitosis
blank         | 
text          | was not required for CENP-A assembly (Bernad et al., 2011; Jansen et al., 2007;
blank         | 
text          | Mellone et al., 2011; Schuh et al., 2007). Additionally, in human cells and Drosophila
blank         | 
text          | and Xenopus embryonic systems, CENP-A assembly was dependent on mitotic exit.
blank         | 
text          | (Bernad et al., 2011; Jansen et al., 2007; Schuh et al., 2007).
blank         | 
text          |        Partitioning of CENP-A during S phase results in a deficit of CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes within each daughter centromere until the next round of CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | assembly. The molecular composition of the CENP-A nucleosome ‘gaps’ is unknown,
blank         | 
text          | but several models have been proposed. The ‘placeholder’ model posits that H3
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes are deposited onto centromeric chromatin during DNA replication and
blank         | 
text          | are subsequently exchanged for CENP-A nucleosomes; the ‘gap filling’ model
blank         | 
text          | postulates that gaps are nucleosome-free; and the ‘splitting’ model proposes that
blank         | 
text          | parental CENP-A nucleosomes are split into half-nucleosomes (‘hemisomes’) which

text          | may or may not combine with conventional histones to form heterotypic octameric
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes. The ‘placeholder’ model is best supported by current evidence. One
blank         | 
text          | study analyzed the distribution of CENP-A, H3, and H3.3 (another histone H3 variant)
blank         | 
text          | within extended chromatin fibers from human cells as a function of the cell cycle.
blank         | 
text          | Both H3 and H3.3 were deposited at centromeres during S phase, adjacent to and
blank         | 
text          | within CENP-A domains. The amount of H3.3 within centromeric chromatin was
blank         | 
text          | substantially lower in G1 phase fibers (e.g. after CENP-A assembly) than in S phase
blank         | 
text          | fibers (e.g. before CENP-A assembly), while H3 levels were the same and CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | levels were about two-fold higher in G1 phase fibers. This suggests that H3.3 was
blank         | 
text          | deposited at centromeres during DNA replication as a ‘placeholder’ and was
blank         | 
text          | subsequently exchanged for CENP-A during G1 phase (Dunleavy et al., 2011). The
blank         | 
text          | observation that H3 replaces CENP-A within centromeric chromatin when CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | levels are reduced in Drosophila or budding yeast also supports the placeholder model
blank         | 
text          | (Blower and Karpen, 2001; Camahort et al., 2007).
blank         | 
text          |        Another important mechanistic consideration is whether parental CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes are replaced or retaining during a round of new CENP-A assembly. The
blank         | 
text          | stability of preexisting CENP-A nucleosomes appears to vary between organisms
blank         | 
text          | and/or developmental stages. In Drosophila embryos, the fluorescence intensity of
blank         | 
text          | GFP-CID foci that were photobleached during metaphase completely recovered during
blank         | 
text          | anaphase, suggesting that pre-existing CID was completely turned over (Schuh et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2007). In contrast, in human cells the fluorescence intensity of GFP-CENP-A foci
blank         | 
text          | bleached during cytokinesis only recovered to 50% of pre-bleach levels during the
blank         | 
text          | subsequent G1, indicating that parental CENP-A was retained (Hemmerich et al.,
blank         | 
              | 
              |

text          | 2008). Consistent with this observation, a pool of fluorescently labeled CENP-A was
blank         | 
text          | stably maintained at centromeres over multiple cell cycles (Jansen et al., 2007). Thus,
blank         | 
text          | in human cells, CENP-A assembly seems to occur by a “loading only” mechanism.
blank         | 
text          | Ultimately, characterizing the state of centromeric chromatin following DNA

text          | replication and the fate of parental CENP-A nucleosomes during new CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | assembly will be critical for understanding mechanisms of CENP-A assembly. In
blank         | 
text          | addition, understanding the structure of the centromere during mitosis may provide
blank         | 
text          | insight into kinetochore formation and function.
blank         | 
text          |        Mutational analyses of CENP-A have defined a CENP-A targeting domain
blank         | 
text          | (CATD), comprised of the loop 1 (L1) and α2 helix regions, that is sufficient for its
blank         | 
text          | centromere localization ((Black et al., 2004), Figure 2A). Replacing this domain with
blank         | 
text          | the corresponding region of histone H3 abolishes centromere targeting, whereas the
blank         | 
text          | converse swap confers specific centromere localization upon the H3CATD chimera.
blank         | 
text          | Mutation of single residues within the α2 helix prevents centromere targeting of
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A and H3CATD, underscoring the importance of this domain (Black et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2007b). The L1 region of CID is required for centromere targeting in Drosophila as
blank         | 
text          | well (Vermaak et al., 2002). The CATD is essential but not sufficient for centromere

text          | targeting of Cse4 in budding yeast (Black et al., 2007b).

text          |        To develop a complete molecular framework for the process of CENP-A

text          | assembly, it will be important to understand the mechanism of CENP-A nucleosome

text          | complexes that govern CENP-A assembly and maintenance at centromeres. It is

text          | important to note that the CENP-A assembly time window is different in yeasts than in
blank         | 
text          | higher eukaryotes. In S. cerevisiae, Cse4 is deposited during S phase, and the parental
blank         | 
text          | Cse4 nucleosome is replaced (Pearson et al., 2004). S. pombe has two molecularly

text          |        It has been proposed that distinct physical properties of CENP-A nucleosomes

blank         | 
text          | corroborated by the crystal structure of the CENP-A-H4 tetramer. The structure
blank         | 
text          | revealed that the CENP-A-CENP-A interface is substantially rotated relative to the
blank         | 
text          | H3-H3 interface, leading to greater compaction of the CENP-A-H4 tetramer. In
blank         | 
text          | addition, there is increased hydrophobicity in the region of CENP-A that contacts H4,
blank         | 
text          | thus providing a physical basis for decreased flexibility of CENP-A-H4 interaction
blank         | 
text          | observed by H/D exchange (Sekulic et al., 2010). Strikingly, the rigidity of the CENP-
blank         | 
text          | A-H4 tetramer is conferred by the CATD, as an H3CATD-H4 tetramer exhibited an H/D
blank         | 
text          | exchange profile nearly identical to that of a CENP-A-H4 tetramer (Black et al., 2004).
blank         | 
text          | Given that the CATD is also a primary determinant of centromere localization, the
blank         | 
text          | authors proposed that the compact, rigid nature of CENP-A-H4 tetramers provides a
blank         | 
text          | physical basis for the exclusive targeting of CENP-A-H4 tetramers to centromeres
blank         | 
text          | (Black et al., 2004; Sekulic et al., 2010). However, the crystal structure of the CENP-
blank         | 
text          | A chaperone HJURP bound to CENP-A and H4 revealed that HJURP binds to a dimer
blank         | 
text          | of CENP-A and H4, not a tetramer as previously assumed. In fact, HJURP binding to
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A-H4 prevents tetramer formation by occluding the CENP-A self-association
blank         | 
text          | domain and inducing conformational changes in CENP-A-H4 that are incompatible
blank         | 
text          | with tetramerization (Hu et al., 2011). Despite the caveat is that the minimal CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | binding domain of HJURP was used for the crystal structure (‘CBD’, amino acids 1-
blank         | 
text          | 80) (Hu et al., 2011), this calls into question the in vivo relevance of structural
blank         | 
text          | differences between CENP-A-H4 and H3-H4 tetramers. On the other hand, the
blank         | 
text          | structure of the CENP-A-H4 dimer bound to HJURP was very similar to its structure

text          | in the context of the tetramer (Hu et al., 2011). Thus, it is possible that the

text          |        Similar H/D exchange experiments using reconstituted mononucleosomes

text          | revealed that the CENP-A-H4 interface is more conformationally rigid than the H3-H4
blank         | 
text          | interface in the context of the nucleosome as well. Analogously to the tetramer
blank         | 
text          | experiments, an H3CATD nucleosome yielded an H/D exchange profile similar to that
blank         | 
text          | of a CENP-A nucleosome, indicating that CENP-A nucleosome rigidity was conferred
blank         | 
text          | by the CATD (Black et al., 2007a). Based on these observations, it was proposed that
blank         | 
text          | distinct physical properties of CENP-A nucleosomes alter the structure of centromeric
blank         | 
text          | chromatin (Black et al., 2007a; Black et al., 2004; Sekulic et al., 2010). However, the
blank         | 
text          | crystal structure of the CENP-A nucleosome showed that the CENP-A-CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | interface is nearly identical to the H3-H3 interface, and SAXS measurements indicated

blank         | 
text          | 2011). Thus, it appears that the major physical distinctions between CENP-A and H3

text          | the preexisting centromere for the next round of CENP-A assembly (Fujita et al.,
blank         |

text          | (Fujita et al., 2007). Thus, though Mis18 regulation of histone acetylation is a

text          |        Scm3 was first identified in S. cerevisiae as a high-copy suppressor of histone
blank         | 
text          | fold mutations in cse4 (Chen et al., 2000; Stoler et al., 2007). Scm3 is required for
blank         | 
text          | Cse4 localization to centromeres, and it is essential for cell viability (Camahort et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2007; Mizuguchi et al., 2007; Stoler et al., 2007). Scm3 localizes to centromeres
blank         | 
text          | throughout the cell cycle (Camahort et al., 2007; Mizuguchi et al., 2007; Stoler et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2007; Xiao et al., 2011) and was proposed to form an unconventional centromeric
blank         | 
text          | nucleosome in complex with Cse4 and H4 (Mizuguchi et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2011);
blank         | 
text          | see discussion above). Scm3 binds directly to Cse4-H4 tetramers through its Cse4
blank         | 
text          | binding domain (CBD, amino acids 90-193) (Mizuguchi et al., 2007), which includes
blank         | 
text          | the Scm3 domain, a region conserved from fungi through higher eukaryotes (Sanchez-
blank         | 
text          | Pulido et al., 2009). Specificity for Cse4 is determined by four residues within the
blank         | 
text          | CATD, as replacing the analogous residues of H3 with the Cse4-specific amino acids
blank         | 
text          | confers Scm3 binding activity to the H3 chimera (Zhou et al., 2011). Scm3 functions
blank         | 
text          | as a Cse4-specific histone chaperone in vitro and can promote assembly of octameric
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes or hexameric Scm3-Cse4-H4 nucleosomes, depending on the DNA
blank         | 
text          | sequence and reconstitution conditions (Dechassa et al., 2011; Shivaraju et al., 2011;
blank         | 
text          | Xiao et al., 2011). Scm3 also has a distinct DNA binding domain at its N-terminus
blank         | 
text          | (DBD, amino acid residues 1-113). The ScmDBD has non-specific DNA binding
blank         | 
text          | activity but shows a mild preference for AT-rich centromeric DNA. This domain is
blank         | 
text          | required for retention of Scm3 within Cse4-H4-DNA complexes, suggesting that the
blank         | 
text          | Scm3-Cse4-H4 complex is substantially reorganized upon interaction with DNA (Xiao
blank         | 
text          | et al., 2011). Consistent with this prediction, the NMR structure of Scm3CBD bound to

blank         | 
text          |        Despite a thorough understanding of the biochemical properties of Scm3 in
blank         | 
text          | vitro, the mechanisms underlying Scm3-dependent Cse4 assembly in vivo are not well
blank         | 
text          | understood. Cse4 and H4 vacate CEN DNA for a short time period during S phase
blank         | 
text          | while Scm3 remains associated, suggesting that Scm3 may recruit Cse4 to CEN DNA
blank         | 
text          | following DNA replication (Xiao et al., 2011). Scm3 also promotes Cse4 localization
blank         | 
text          | through the recruitment of the CBF3 complex component Ndc10, which is also
blank         | 
text          | essential for Cse4 localization to centromeres. Scm3 and Ndc10 are interdependent for
blank         | 
text          | their localization to centromeres. Because the CBF3 complex binds specifically to the
blank         | 
text          | conserved CDEIII sequence element within CEN DNA, this interaction also provides
blank         | 
text          | a mechanism for the centromere-specific targeting of Scm3 (Camahort et al., 2007;
blank         | 
text          | Mizuguchi et al., 2007).
blank         | 
text          |        As in budding yeast, the S. pombe homolog of Scm3, Scm3Sp, is essential for
blank         | 
text          | Cnp1 localization to centromeres and for centromere function. Unlike budding yeast
blank         | 
text          | Scm3, Scm3Sp localizes to centromeres in a cell cycle dependent manner: it
blank         | 
text          | delocalizes from centromeres during mitosis and relocalizes during late telophase
blank         | 
text          | (Pidoux et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2009). Notably, this localization pattern is similar
blank         | 
text          | to that of the essential Cnp1 assembly factors Mis16 and Mis18 (Fujita et al., 2007;
blank         | 
text          | Hayashi et al., 2004). Scm3Sp localization is independent of Cnp1 but depends on
blank         | 
text          | Mis6 (CENP-I in humans), Mis16, and Mis18, suggesting that it functions
blank         | 
text          | downstream of the Mis16-Mis18 complex in Cnp1 assembly. Scm3Sp was shown to

text          | Whether Scm3Sp has histone chaperone activity akin to that of budding yeast Scm3 has

text          | largely absent from centromeric chromatin (Williams et al., 2009). However, its
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | Foltz et al., 2009). HJURP is also associated with CENP-A chromatin, albeit at
blank         | 
text          | substantially lower levels (Foltz et al., 2006). HJURP was later shown to contain a
blank         | 
text          | region of homology to Scm3 (the Scm3 domain), and it appears to function
blank         | 
text          | analogously to Scm3 in fungi (Sanchez-Pulido et al., 2009). HJURP associates
blank         | 
text          | specifically with prenucleosomal CENP-A complexes within cells and is required for

text          | new CENP-A assembly (Dunleavy et al., 2009; Foltz et al., 2009). Analogously to
blank         | 
text          | fission yeast Scm3, HJURP targets to centromeres during early G1 phase and persists

text          |         HJURP binds directly and specifically to CENP-A-H4 in vitro through its
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A binding domain (CBD, amino acids 1-80), which includes the conserved
blank         | 
text          | Scm3 domain (Foltz et al., 2009; Shuaib et al., 2010). Specificity for CENP-A is
blank         | 
text          | mediated by the CATD, as HJURP binds to H3CATD chimeric proteins in vitro and
blank         | 
text          | associates with H3CATD prenucleosomal complexes in vivo (Foltz et al., 2009; Shuaib
blank         | 
text          | et al., 2010). Furthermore siRNA-mediated knockdown of HJURP prevents H3CATD

text          | localization to centromeres, supporting the in vivo relevance of the HJURP-CATD

blank         | 
text          | indicating that its chaperone activity is specific to CENP-A (Barnhart et al., 2011).
blank         | 
text          | Surprisingly, the crystal structure of HJURPCBD bound to CENP-A and H4 revealed
blank         | 
text          | that HJURP binds to a dimer of CENP-A and H4 and that HJURPCBD binding prevents

blank         | 
text          | The authors proposed that an as-yet-unidentified APC substrate is required for CID

text          | reduction in the CENP-A immunofluorescence signal in Rsf-1-depleted cells. This
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | leading to a 50% decrease in total CENP-A levels at centromeres. Depletion of Ect2 or

text          | Cdc42 led to a similar drop in total CENP-A levels, while the effect of Rac1 depletion

text          | was more modest, suggesting that Cdc42 is the primary GTPase involved in this

text          | in distinct pathways, as MgcRacGAP localized to centromeres later in G1 than Rsf-1
blank         | 
text          | (Lagana et al., 2010; Perpelescu et al., 2009). Furthermore, while MgcRacGAP

text          | depletion specifically prevented retention of newly assembled CENP-A (Lagana et al.,

blank         | 
text          | CENP-A (Perpelescu et al., 2009). The authors proposed that Cdc42 (and possibly

text          | sequence was rapidly degraded within cells but persisted at the centromere (Collins et
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | prevented ubiquitylation of Cse4 in vitro (Hewawasam et al., 2010). It is not known

text          | whether Psh1 ubiquitylates chromatin-bound and/or soluble Cse4. Psh1 could directly

blank         | 
text          |        All CENP-C homologs, from yeast through mammals, contain a highly
blank         | 
text          | conserved ‘CENP-C signature motif’ (23 amino acids in length) as well as a conserved
blank         | 
text          | cupin domain (~100 amino acids in length) (Talbert et al., 2004). CENP-C is a large,
blank         | 
text          | multi-functional protein (107 kD in humans, 156 kD in Xenopus laevis), and domain

text          | mapping and mutagenesis studies have identified regions that are responsible for
blank         | 
text          | kinetochore assembly, protein stability, DNA binding, nucleosome binding,

text          | dimerization, and centromere targeting (Figure 2B).
blank         | 
text          |         The amino terminus of CENP-C promotes kinetochore assembly, as an amino

text          | terminally truncated xCENP-C (aa381-1400, Figure 2B) protein failed to recruit many

text          | centromere and kinetochore proteins that are dependent on CENP-C for their
blank         | 
text          | localization to centromeres (Milks et al., 2009). Two groups recently showed that the
blank         | 
text          | Mis12 complex binds directly to the N-terminus of CENP-C, providing insight into
blank         | 
text          | the molecular mechanisms underlying CENP-C’s ‘kinetochore building’ function
blank         | 
text          | (Przewloka et al., 2011; Screpanti et al., 2011). It will be important to determine
blank         | 
text          | whether the amino terminus of CENP-C of mediates additional direct interactions
blank         | 
text          | between CENP-C and other centromere and kinetochore proteins. The amino terminus
blank         | 
text          | of CENP-C (aa1-373) has also been implicated in regulation of protein stability

text          | ((Lanini and McKeon, 1995), Figure 2B).

text          |        CENP-C binds directly and specifically to CENP-A nucleosomes through its
blank         | 
text          | ‘central domain’ (aa426-537, Figure 2B). This interaction is mediated by the C-
blank         | 
text          | terminal tail of CENP-A, as replacing the C-terminal tail of H3 with that of CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | is sufficient to confer CENP-C binding (Carroll et al., 2010). The CENP-C central

blank         | 
text          | Sugimoto et al., 1997; Sugimoto et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1996). This domain is
blank         | 
text          | sufficient for targeting to centromeres in human cells, albeit with low efficiency
blank         | 
text          | (Sugimoto et al., 1997; Sugimoto et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1996). CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | nucleosome binding is likely the main mechanism driving recruitment of the CENP-C
blank         | 
text          | central domain to centromeres, as a point mutation in CENP-C that disrupts its

blank         | 
text          | extract (Carroll et al., 2010; Song et al., 2002). A screen for point mutations that
blank         | 
text          | prevented centromere targeting of the CENP-C central domain identified many
blank         | 
text          | mutations within the CENP-A nucleosome binding domain but none within the
blank         | 
text          | minimal DNA binding domain (aa396-498), suggesting that DNA binding does not
blank         | 
text          | contribute to centromere localization (Song et al., 2002). Importantly, mutation of the
blank         | 
text          | X. laevis CENP-C central domain led to a 60% reduction in centromere targeting
blank         | 
text          | relative to the wild-type protein, indicating that additional mechanisms exist for
blank         | 
text          | recruiting CENP-C to centromeres (Carroll et al., 2010).
blank         | 
text          |        The CENP-C signature motif (aa736-758, Figure 2B) is essential for
blank         | 
text          | centromere targeting, as a single point mutation (corresponding to R742 in human
blank         | 
text          | CENP-C) abolishes centromere localization in Drosophila cultured cells (Heeger,
blank         | 
text          | 2005) and Xenopus egg extract (Milks et al., 2009). Interestingly, this mutation does
blank         | 
text          | not prevent centromere targeting in chicken DT40 cells but led to metaphase arrest,

text          | interactions are unknown.
blank         | 
text          |        Finally, two distinct domains of CENP-C have been implicated in
blank         | 
text          | oligomerization, a fragment near the N-terminus (aa74-244, Figure 2B) and the C-
blank         | 
text          | terminal cupin domain (aa856-944, Figure 2B). Following treatment of recombinant
blank         | 
text          | CENP-C74-244 with a cross-linking reagent, higher molecular weight species
blank         | 
text          | corresponding to the size of dimers and tetramers could be detected by SDS-PAGE.
blank         | 
text          | Most of the protein remained in monomeric form, suggesting that this is a low-affinity
blank         | 
text          | oligomerization site (Sugimoto et al., 1997). Fragments of CENP-C that included this
blank         | 
text          | putative oligomerization domain but not the central domain (for example, aa23-410)
blank         | 
text          | did not localize to centromeres or associate with α-satellite DNA in cells expressing
blank         | 
text          | endogenous CENP-C, suggesting that this domain does not mediate oligomerization in
blank         | 
text          | vivo (Politi et al., 2002; Trazzi et al., 2002; Yang et al., 1996). Similar cross-linking
blank         | 
text          | experiments using recombinant CENP-C820-943 (which contains the cupin domain)
blank         | 
text          | revealed a single band migrating at the predicted size of a dimer. Furthermore,
blank         | 
text          | rCENP-C820-943 subjected to size exclusion chromatography was eluted in a single
blank         | 
text          | peak corresponding to the molecular weight of a dimer (Sugimoto et al., 1997). These
blank         | 
text          | experiments strongly suggest that the C-terminal cupin domain mediates dimerization
blank         | 
text          | and that this domain dimerizes in solution. The crystal structure of the budding yeast
blank         | 
text          | cupin domain confirmed that it exists as a dimer (Cohen et al., 2008). As discussed
blank         | 
text          | above, fragments of CENP-C that contain the central domain but lack the cupin
blank         | 
text          | domain target to centromeres poorly, indicating that the cupin domain is required for
blank         | 
text          | efficient assembly of CENP-C at centromeres (Lanini and McKeon, 1995; Sugimoto

text          | et al., 1997; Sugimoto et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1996). Partial deletion of the cupin
blank         | 
text          | domain or mutation of a single residue predicted to disrupt dimerization led to weak
blank         | 
text          | targeting of xCENP-C to Xenopus sperm centromeres, whereas a truncation mutant
blank         | 
text          | completely lacking the cupin domain exhibited no centromere localization. Thus,
blank         | 
text          | several domains of CENP-C contribute to its centromere localization: the central
blank         | 
text          | domain, the CENP-C motif, and the cupin/dimerization domain. Consistent with the
blank         | 
text          | idea that multiple targeting mechanisms ensure efficient assembly of CENP-C at
blank         | 
text          | centromeres, mutation of both the central domain and the dimerization domain
blank         | 
text          | abolished centromere localization (Carroll et al., 2010).

text          |        Xenopus laevis egg extracts are a powerful model system for studying the
blank         | 
text          | events of the cell cycle. Extracts faithfully recapitulate many aspects of the cell cycle

text          | mitotic chromosome condensation and spindle assembly, and chromosome movement
blank         | 
text          | during mitosis (reviewed in (Desai et al., 1999; MURRAY, 1991)). X. laevis eggs are

text          | arrested in metaphase of meiosis II, and cytoplasmic extracts prepared from those eggs

text          | maintain that arrest. When calcium is added to the extracts to mimic fertilization, the

text          | basic proteins called protamines to facilitate chromatin compaction (reviewed in
blank         | 
text          | (Grimes, 1986)). However, in many animals, including Xenopus, CENP-A is

blank         | 
text          | (Haaf et al., 1990; Palmer et al., 1990; Zeitlin et al., 2005). This underscores the
blank         | 
text          | importance of CENP-A as a centromere marker and highlights the fact that the
blank         | 
text          | centromere is maintained at a specific locus through organismal generations. When
blank         | 
text          | demembranated sperm are added to mitotic egg extracts, protamines are rapidly
blank         | 
text          | exchanged for core histones, chromosomes form condensed structures akin to

text          | condensed mitotic chromosomes observed within cells, and functional centromeres

text          | al., 2009; Minshull et al., 1994; Philpott and Leno, 1992; Wood et al., 1997).
blank         | 
text          | Subsequent addition of calcium to the extract leads to kinetochore disassembly,

text          | chromosome decondensation, and nucleus formation (Emanuele and Stukenberg,
blank         | 
text          | 2009; Lohka and Maller, 1985; MURRAY, 1991). Unlike in somatic cells, there is no
blank         | 
text          | gap phase in the extract, mimicking the rapid, synchronous cycles of division without

text          | transcription (~35 minutes each) initiated by the egg following fertilization (Newport
blank         | 
text          | and Kirschner, 1982; SATOH, 1977). DNA replication begins shortly after release

text          | from metaphase arrest and is complete by ~80’ following release (Desai et al., 1999;

text          | mechanistic role of these proteins in CENP-A assembly in somatic cells has proved

text          | difficult because manipulation of protein levels in vivo (through depletion or

title         | Conclusions
blank         | 
text          |         The centromere is a specialized chromatin domain that is essential for accurate
blank         | 
text          | chromosome segregation in all eukaryotes. Centromeres are epigenetically defined by
blank         | 
text          | the presence of CENP-A nucleosomes, thus understanding how CENP-A chromatin is
blank         | 
text          | maintained through rounds of cell division is central to understanding genome stability.
blank         | 
text          | As discussed above, many factors have been identified that promote new CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | nucleosome assembly and/or CENP-A stability at centromeres, though their functions
blank         | 
text          | are not well understood at a molecular level.
blank         | 
text          |         Here we investigate the mechanisms underlying centromeric chromatin

text          | assembly using a cell-free system for CENP-A assembly. This thesis is divided into
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | CENP-A assembly in extract recapitulates the cell cycle dependence and HJURP
blank         | 
text          | requirement of CENP-A assembly in somatic cells. In the second chapter, we use this
blank         | 
text          | system to investigate the mechanisms that target essential CENP-A assembly factors
blank         | 
text          | to the centromere. We demonstrate that the constitutive centromere protein CENP-C
blank         | 
text          | recruits the Mis18 complex protein M18BP1 and the CENP-A chaperone HJURP to
blank         | 
text          | centromeres to promote new CENP-A assembly. Furthermore, we show that M18BP1
blank         | 
text          | interacts directly with CENP-C through conserved domains in the CENP-C protein
blank         | 
text          | and that the interaction between CENP-C and M18BP1 is cell cycle regulated in egg
blank         | 
text          | extract. By establishing the first molecular link between the preexisting centromere
blank         | 
text          | and the proteins required for new CENP-A assembly in higher eukaryotes, this work
blank         | 
text          | advances our understanding of how the centromere is stably propagated at a single
blank         | 
text          | locus through cellular and organismal generations.

title         | Introduction
blank         | 
text          |        Accurate chromosome segregation is essential for the faithful distribution of
blank         | 
text          | the genome during cell division. In mitosis, each chromosome assembles a multi-
blank         | 
text          | protein complex called the kinetochore that serves as the primary binding site for the
blank         | 
text          | microtubules of the mitotic spindle. The kinetochore mediates the bipolar attachment
blank         | 
text          | of paired chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, monitors proper chromosome-spindle
blank         | 
text          | attachment through the mitotic checkpoint and couples spindle forces to chromosome
blank         | 
text          | segregation at anaphase (Cheeseman and Desai, 2008; Cleveland et al., 2003; Rieder
blank         | 
text          | and Salmon, 1998). The assembly site for the kinetochore is a specialized chromatin
blank         | 
text          | domain called the centromere that is characterized by the incorporation of the histone
blank         | 
text          | H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A) into centromeric nucleosomes (Palmer et
blank         | 
text          | al., 1991; Palmer et al., 1987; Sullivan et al., 1994). CENP-A chromatin recruits a
blank         | 
text          | collection of approximately 20 proteins called the constitutive centromere associated
blank         | 
text          | network (CCAN) that are bound to the chromosome throughout the cell cycle and
blank         | 
text          | serve as the site for mitotic kinetochore assembly. Mutation or loss of either CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | or proteins of the CCAN results in kinetochore formation defects and chromosome
blank         | 
text          | missegregation (Amano et al., 2009; Cheeseman et al., 2008; Foltz et al., 2006; Hori et
blank         | 
text          | al., 2008; McClelland et al., 2007).
blank         | 
text          |        Vertebrate centromeres occur at a single region along the length of the
blank         | 
text          | chromosome that is maintained through mitotic and meiotic divisions. Human
blank         | 
text          | centromeric chromatin assembles on long stretches of repetitive α-satellite DNA. In
blank         | 
text          | rare cases, de novo centromere formation can occur outside of α-containing sequences,

text          | resulting in the formation of stably maintained neocentromeres marked by CENP-A

text          | 1993). CENP-A nucleosome assembly into chromatin occurs during a specific time

text          | window in the cell cycle, during telophase/G1 in somatic cells and after anaphase

blank         | 
text          | al., 2007). How the preexisting centromere directs the local assembly of new CENP-A

blank         | 
text          | Cnp1 (Pidoux et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2009). In human cells, affinity purification
blank         | 
text          | of a soluble (non-chromatin-associated) human CENP-A complex identified 4 proteins
blank         | 
text          | (CENP-A, histone H4, nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) and Holliday junction recognizing

blank         | 
text          | 2009). HJURP can assemble CENP-A nucleosomes in vitro, and artificially targeting
blank         | 
text          | HJURP to a non-centromeric locus led to CENP-A incorporation into chromatin at
blank         | 
text          | that site, suggesting that HJURP may directly promote CENP-A deposition in vivo

text          | (Barnhart et al., 2011).

text          |        New CENP-A assembly also requires the human Mis18 complex (Mis18α,
blank         | 
text          | Mis18β, and Mis18 binding protein 1 (M18BP1), also known as KNL2 (kinetochore
blank         | 
text          | null 2)) (Fujita et al., 2007; Maddox et al., 2007). The fission yeast homolog of the
blank         | 
text          | Mis18 proteins (mis18) and the C. elegans homolog of M18BP1 (CeKNL2) are
blank         | 
text          | required for CENP-A localization to centromeres in fission yeast and worms,
blank         | 
text          | respectively (Hayashi et al., 2004; Maddox et al., 2007). The Mis18 complex targets to
blank         | 
text          | centromeres in human cells beginning in late anaphase and continuing through G1, the
blank         | 
text          | same time that new CENP-A is being assembled (Dunleavy et al., 2009; Foltz et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2009). The Mis18 complex has been proposed to ‘prime’ centromeric chromatin for
blank         | 
text          | new CENP-A assembly (Fujita et al., 2007), and it is required for centromere targeting
blank         | 
text          | of HJURP in early G1 phase (Barnhart et al., 2011). However, the mechanisms

text          | regulating the cell cycle dependent localization of the Mis18 complex to centromeres
blank         | 
text          | as well as its functions in CENP-A assembly are not well understood.

text          |        Additional protein complexes that govern CENP-A assembly and maintenance

text          | several constitutive centromere proteins (CENP-C, CENP-N, CENP-H, CENP-I, and
blank         | 
text          | CENP-K) have been implicated in CENP-A assembly in mammalian cells (Carroll et
blank         | 
text          | al., 2010; Carroll et al., 2009; Okada et al., 2006). However, the mechanistic roles of

text          | proteins from somatic cells or embryos leads to mitotic errors, aberrant cell cycle

text          | progression, and cell (or organismal) death, making it difficult to assess whether
blank         | 
text          | protein loss also effects CENP-A assembly. Thus, we sought to develop an in vitro
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A assembly assay in extracts of Xenopus laevis eggs. Xenopus egg extracts are
blank         | 
text          | an ideal model system for the study of CENP-A assembly for several reasons: (1) the
blank         |

text          |          To study the assembly of CENP-A chromatin we developed an in vitro system
blank         | 
text          | for CENP-A assembly in Xenopus laevis egg extracts similar to a recently described
blank         | 
text          | method (Bernad et al., 2011). X. laevis eggs are arrested in metaphase of meiosis II,
blank         | 
text          | and cytoplasmic extracts from eggs maintain that arrest. When calcium is added to the
blank         | 
text          | egg extract to mimic fertilization, the extracts transition from metaphase into

text          | interphase, and this transition can be monitored morphologically by following

blank         | 
text          |          To distinguish newly loaded CENP-A from preexisting CENP-A, we added

text          | RNA encoding myc epitope-tagged CENP-A to extracts and monitored the
blank         | 
text          | localization of the tagged CENP-A by immunofluorescence. Myc-CENP-A was

blank         | 
text          | al., 2011). Artificially targeting HJURP to a non-centromeric chromosomal locus led

text          | to exchange with the endogenous CENP-A within CENP-A-HJURP complexes. In
blank         | 
text          | fact, Bernad et al. observed that myc-CENP-A competed poorly with endogenous
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A for binding to HJURP, suggesting that CENP-A and HJURP are stably
blank         | 
text          | associated in extract (Bernad et al., 2011). Given this result, we were surprised to
blank         | 
text          | observe that exogenously added xHJURP stimulated assembly of myc-CENP-A and
blank         | 
text          | endogenous CENP-A with equal efficiency (Figure 3). It is possible that exogenously
blank         | 
text          | added xHJURP can exchange with the endogenous HJURP to bind CENP-A-H4,
blank         | 
text          | though unlikely given the observed stability of the HJURP-CENP-A complex with
blank         | 
text          | respect to CENP-A exchange (Bernad et al., 2011). This model can be tested by
blank         | 
text          | immunoprecipitating exogenous (tagged) HJURP and western blotting for endogenous
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A. Another possibility is that exogenous xHJURP stimulates assembly of pre-
blank         | 
text          | formed HJURP-CENP-A-H4 complexes, perhaps through increasing the efficiency of
blank         | 
text          | centromere targeting or facilitating more rapid deposition of CENP-A-H4 into
blank         | 
text          | chromatin once HJURP-CENP-A-H4 complexes reach the centromere. Determining

blank         | 
text          | absence of CENP-A may inform these models.
blank         | 
text          |        We observed that addition of xHJURP to 1.6-fold the levels present in the

text          | extract was sufficient to stimulate myc-CENP-A assembly ~25-30 fold. Surprisingly,

blank         | 
text          | equivalent stimulation of myc-CENP-A assembly (data not shown). This is consistent
blank         | 
text          | with a previous report showing that restoring HJURP levels to ~25% of endogenous

text          | protein in our assembly assays (Supplemental Figure 1A), this data suggests that sub-
blank         |

text          |        We consistently found that the total amount of chromatin-incorporated CENP-

text          | A doubled by 60’ after addition of calcium to the extracts (Figure 3A), but we and
blank         | 
text          | others did not detect significant accumulation of HJURP at centromeres until later in

text          | interphase (75’-90’ after calcium addition) (Figure 1D and data not shown, (Bernad et
blank         | 
text          | al., 2011)). This observation is consistent with an enzymatic role for HJURP in the
blank         | 
text          | early stages of CENP-A assembly. Furthermore, the fact that HJURP persists at
blank         | 
text          | centromeres following CENP-A deposition raises the possibility that HJURP may

blank         | 
text          | al., 2010). However, HJURP does not appear to be required for CENP-A stability in

text          | import or retention of CENP-A. An alternative possibility is that the “background”
blank         | 
text          | myc-CENP-A we observe reflects HJURP-dependent incorporation into non-

blank         | 
text          | (Bernad et al., 2011)). We find that new CENP-A assembly begins ~45’ after release

text          | from metaphase arrest and continues throughout interphase (Supplemental Figure 2).
blank         | 
text          | Under our standard assay conditions, new CENP-A continues to be assembled until 75’
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | myc-CENP-A translation (Figure 4) demonstrate that late interphase extract is
blank         | 
text          | competent for CENP-A assembly. In these experiments, outlined in Figure 4A, sperm
blank         | 
text          | chromatin is present in the extract 0’ to 60’ after calcium addition (metaphase
blank         | 
text          | translation sample) or 60’ to 120’ after calcium addition (interphase translation
blank         | 
text          | sample). We observed efficient assembly of myc-CENP-A at centromeres under both
blank         | 
text          | translation conditions, indicating that late interphase extract supports CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | assembly (Figure 4C, D). In contrast to these observations, Bernad et al. reported that
blank         | 
text          | assembly of endogenous CENP-A was restricted to a narrow time window between
blank         | 
text          | release from metaphase arrest and initiation of DNA replication (~45 minutes post-
blank         | 
text          | release) (Bernad et al., 2011). The differences we observe may be due to the fact that
blank         | 
text          | there is a limited pool of CENP-A in the extract and that augmenting that pool with
blank         | 
text          | additional CENP-A allows for CENP-A assembly at any time during interphase. It
blank         | 
text          | will be interesting to test whether increasing or decreasing the amount of myc-CENP-

text          |        Interestingly, centromeric myc-CENP-A levels were 1.7 ± 0.7-fold higher

text          | under ‘interphase translation’ conditions than ‘metaphase translation’ conditions

text          | calcium. Consistent with this model, we observe that addition of small molecule Cdk

text          | inhibitors to extracts, which rapidly drives extracts into interphase, led to increased

blank         | 
text          |        CENP-A assembly requires passage through mitosis, but we found that myc-

text          | during mitotic exit for new CENP-A assembly to occur. Surprisingly, Bernad et al.
blank         | 
text          | reported that CENP-A assembly in CENP-A-depleted extracts was rescued by the

text          | addition of undepleted extracts concurrent with calcium but not by addition of
blank         | 
text          | undepleted extracts after release into interphase (Bernad et al., 2011). This suggests
blank         | 
text          | that some other component of the extract (that’s co-depleted with CENP-A) needs to
blank         | 
text          | pass through mitosis for efficient CENP-A assembly. The histone chaperone proteins

text          | NPM1 and Rbap46/48 were also found to be associated with pre-nucleosomal CENP-
blank         | 
text          | A (Dunleavy et al., 2009; Foltz et al., 2009; Shuaib et al., 2010), but both NPM1 and

text          | Rbap 46/48 are abundant in extract and overall protein levels are not affected by

text          | CENP-A depletion (Bernad et al., 2011). An interesting possibility is that the pool of
blank         | 
text          | NPM1 and/or Rbap46/48 that is specifically associated with CENP-A is modified
blank         |

text          | (Bernad et al., 2011). It is possible that the protein level of hHJURP in our
blank         | 
text          | experiments was not sufficient to promote detectable assembly of myc-CENP-A at
blank         | 
text          | centromeres. However, given that equal amounts of hHJURP and xHJURP were
blank         | 
text          | translated in the extracts (Supplemental Figure 3F), it is clear that xHJURP promotes
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A assembly more efficiently than hHJURP.
blank         | 
text          |        We observed that the level of non-centromeric myc-CENP-A was ~2.7-fold
blank         | 
text          | higher in the presence of xHJURP than in the presence of hHJURP or no HJURP. This
blank         | 
text          | suggests that xHJURP but not hHJURP promotes nuclear import (or nuclear retention)
blank         | 
text          | of xCENP-A. This could be because hHJURP cannot bind to xCENP-A-H4 dimers or
blank         | 
text          | because hHJURP cannot interact with essential nuclear import factors. We did not
blank         | 
text          | determine whether hHJURP enters the nucleus and localizes to sperm centromeres. It
blank         | 
text          | will be interesting to determine whether bypassing the block to nuclear localization of
blank         | 
text          | myc-CENP-A, by fusing a nuclear localization sequence to myc-xCENP-A or to
blank         | 
text          | hHJURP, allows hHJURP to promote xCENP-A assembly. An N-terminal fragment of
blank         | 
text          | hHJURP that contains the Scm3 domain, the most highly conserved region of HJURP,
blank         | 
text          | can promote incorporation of hCENP-A into chromatin in vitro and in vivo (Barnhart
blank         | 
text          | et al., 2011). Furthermore, the interaction between hHJURP and hCENP-A is mediated
blank         | 
text          | by the CATD, a conserved domain within CENP-A (Shuaib et al., 2010).

text          |        In summary, we have developed an in vitro CENP-A assembly assay in

blank         | 
text          |        Briefly, images were normalized by median filtering the image and then

text          | dividing the original image by the filtered intensity value. Centromeres were found
blank         | 
text          | using Otsu’s thresholding method (Otsu, 1979) modified to recursively divide regions

blank         | 
text          | larger or smaller than centromeres. Centromeres were grouped into cells using
blank         | 
text          | Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering (McLachlan and Basford, 1988). The
blank         | 
text          | initial guess for clustering the image was made by first heavily Gaussian blurring the
blank         | 
text          | image, thresholding the image for nonzero pixel intensities and using the resulting
blank         | 
text          | regions as a first cluster approximation. These initial clusters were then refined by
blank         | 
text          | randomly subdividing the image and then iteratively GMM clustering until no new
blank         | 
text          | successful subdivisions were made. Centromere intensities were then quantified in the
blank         | 
text          | original image and an average over the entire image was calculated. The images were
blank         | 
text          | manually examined to exclude misidentified centromeres but the automated analysis

text          | was accurate enough that the manual examination did not measurably change the
blank         | 
text          | results. The validity of the segmentation method was verified by manual analysis of a
blank         | 
text          | subset of images (in which centromeres were identified by drawing circles around

text          | Kinetochores assemble on a specialized chromosomal locus termed the centromere,

text          | characterized by the replacement of histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes with the

text          | essential histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A). Understanding how

text          | CENP-A chromatin is assembled and maintained is central to understanding
blank         | 
text          | chromosome segregation mechanisms. CENP-A nucleosome assembly requires the
blank         | 
text          | Mis18 complex and the CENP-A chaperone HJURP. These factors localize to

text          | centromeres in telophase/G1, when new CENP-A chromatin is assembled. The

text          | mechanisms that control their targeting are unknown. Here we identify a mechanism

text          | for recruiting the Mis18 complex protein M18BP1 to centromeres. We show that
blank         | 
text          | depletion of CENP-C prevents M18BP1 targeting to metaphase centromeres and

text          | inhibits CENP-A chromatin assembly. We find that M18BP1 directly binds CENP-C
blank         | 
text          | through conserved domains in the CENP-C protein. Thus, CENP-C provides a link

title         | Introduction
blank         | 
text          |        Accurate chromosome segregation is essential for the faithful distribution of
blank         | 
text          | the genome during cell division. In mitosis, each chromosome assembles a multi-
blank         | 
text          | protein complex called the kinetochore that serves as the primary binding site for
blank         | 
text          | microtubules of the mitotic spindle. The kinetochore mediates the bipolar attachment
blank         | 
text          | of paired chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, monitors proper chromosome-spindle
blank         | 
text          | attachment through the mitotic checkpoint and couples spindle forces to chromosome
blank         | 
text          | segregation at anaphase (Cheeseman and Desai, 2008; Cleveland et al., 2003; Rieder
blank         | 
text          | and Salmon, 1998). The assembly site for the kinetochore is a specialized chromatin
blank         | 
text          | domain called the centromere that is characterized by the incorporation of the histone
blank         | 
text          | H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A) into centromeric nucleosomes (Palmer et
blank         | 
text          | al., 1991; Palmer et al., 1987; Sullivan et al., 1994). CENP-A chromatin recruits a
blank         | 
text          | collection of approximately 20 proteins called the constitutive centromere associated
blank         | 
text          | network (CCAN) that are bound to the chromosome throughout the cell cycle and
blank         | 
text          | serve as the site for mitotic kinetochore assembly. Mutation or loss of either CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | or proteins of the CCAN results in kinetochore formation defects and chromosome
blank         | 
text          | missegregation (Amano et al., 2009; Cheeseman et al., 2008; Foltz et al., 2006; Hori et
blank         | 
text          | al., 2008; McClelland et al., 2007).
blank         | 
text          |        Vertebrate centromeres occur at a single region along the length of the
blank         | 
text          | chromosome that is maintained through mitotic and meiotic divisions. Human
blank         | 
text          | centromeric chromatin assembles on long stretches of repetitive α-satellite DNA. In
blank         | 
text          | rare cases, de novo centromere formation can occur outside of α-satellite containing
blank         | 
text          | DNA sequences, resulting in the formation of stably maintained neocentromeres

blank         | 
text          | position is the site of CENP-A nucleosome incorporation into chromatin and not DNA
blank         | 
text          | sequence (Allshire and Karpen, 2008; Barry et al., 1999; Carroll and Straight, 2006;
blank         | 
text          | Voullaire et al., 1993). CENP-A nucleosome assembly into chromatin occurs during a
blank         | 
text          | specific time window in the cell cycle, during telophase/G1 in somatic cells and after
blank         | 
text          | anaphase chromosome segregation in embryos (Bernad et al., 2011; Jansen et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2007; Schuh et al., 2007). How the preexisting centromere directs the local assembly
blank         | 
text          | of new CENP-A nucleosomes during G1 is not known.
blank         | 
text          |        Several protein complexes that govern CENP-A assembly and maintenance at
blank         | 
text          | centromeres have been identified through genetic and biochemical studies in yeasts,
blank         | 
text          | flies, worms, and humans. Studies of chromosome missegregation mutants in
blank         | 
text          | Schizosaccharomyces pombe discovered the mis16 and mis18 genes that when
blank         | 
text          | mutated lead to a loss of Cnp1 (S. pombe CENP-A) from centromeres (Hayashi et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2004). S. pombe mis16 is homologous to the histone chaperones RbAp46 and 48 and

text          | RbAp46/48 depletion from human cells using RNAi leads to defects in CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | assembly (Dunleavy et al., 2009; Hayashi et al., 2004). Two homologs of mis18 have
blank         | 
text          | been identified in vertebrates, Mis18α and Mis18β, as well as an additional Mis18α-
blank         | 
text          | Mis18β binding protein, M18BP1 (Fujita et al., 2007). A homolog of M18BP1,
blank         | 
text          | kinetochore null 2 (knl-2), was discovered through RNAi screening for chromosome
blank         | 
text          | segregation defects in worms (Maddox et al., 2007). Depletion of either Mis18α from
blank         | 
text          | human cells or KNL-2 from worm embryos prevented CENP-A assembly at
blank         | 
text          | centromeres (Fujita et al., 2007; Maddox et al., 2007). Immunoprecipitation

blank         | 
text          | 2007; Hayashi et al., 2008). Furthermore, RbAp46/48 co-purifies with CENP-A in
blank         | 
text          | affinity purification experiments from both human and fly cells (Dunleavy et al., 2009;
blank         | 
text          | Furuyama, 2006). Immunoprecipitation of KNL-2 from C. elegans embryos also

text          | precipitates CENP-A containing chromatin but the human Mis18 complex components
blank         | 
text          | do not appear to directly associate with soluble or nucleosomal CENP-A (Carroll et
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | CENP-A and is required for CENP-A chromatin assembly. First identified as a
blank         | 
text          | suppressor of CSE4 (S. cerevisiae CENP-A) mutants (Chen et al., 2000), the Scm3
blank         | 
text          | protein was shown to interact directly with Cse4 and was required for Cse4 association
blank         | 
text          | with yeast centromeres (Camahort et al., 2007; Mizuguchi et al., 2007; Stoler et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2007). The S. pombe homolog of Scm3 is also required for Cnp1 localization to
blank         | 
text          | centromeres in fission yeast and was shown to interact with Cnp1 and with Mis16 and
blank         | 
text          | Mis18, thus providing another molecular link between the Mis18 complex of proteins
blank         | 
text          | and CENP-A (Pidoux et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2009). In human cells, affinity

blank         | 
text          | chaperone complex for CENP-A (Dunleavy et al., 2009; Foltz et al., 2009). HJURP
blank         | 
text          | contains a region of homology to the yeast Scm3 proteins (the Scm3 domain) and
blank         | 
text          | HJURP appears to function analogously to Scm3 in fungi (Sanchez-Pulido et al.,

text          | Xenopus HJURP from frog egg extracts causes defects in CENP-A assembly akin to

blank         | 
text          |         Regulating the localization of the Mis18 complex and the HJURP chaperone
blank         | 
text          | complex proteins is likely to be an important step in achieving spatial and temporal
blank         | 
text          | control of the CENP-A assembly process. In human cells the Mis18 complex and the
blank         | 
text          | HJURP chaperone complex are targeted to centromeres during late anaphase/telophase
blank         | 
text          | and remain associated with centromeres during G1 phase, the time window during
blank         | 
text          | which new CENP-A assembly occurs (Dunleavy et al., 2009; Foltz et al., 2009; Fujita
blank         | 
text          | et al., 2007; Maddox et al., 2007). The Mis18 complex localizes to centromeres prior
blank         | 
text          | to HJURP (Foltz et al., 2009) and HJURP fails to localize to centromeres in cells
blank         | 
text          | depleted of the Mis18 complex (Barnhart et al., 2011). It has been proposed that
blank         | 
text          | Mis18 complex proteins may ‘prime’ the centromere so that it is competent to load
blank         | 
text          | new CENP-A histone molecules (Fujita et al., 2007). However, the molecular
blank         | 
text          | interactions that target the Mis18 complex and the HJURP complex to centromeres are
blank         | 
text          | unknown.
blank         | 
text          |         Here we use an in vitro system for CENP-A assembly in Xenopus egg extracts

text          | equally well to centromeres in the context of endogenous M18BP1 proteins (Figure
blank         |

text          | presence of M18BP1-2. Both M18BP1-1 and M18BP1-2 rescued CENP-A assembly

text          | respectively) (Supplemental Figure 2A-D). We calculated the degree of rescue by

text          |        In contrast, CENP-C depletion caused premature M18BP1 localization to

text          | levels of M18BP1-FLAG at centromeres (Supplemental Figure 3C). This is likely due

text          | inhibited CENP-C binding to M18BP1 (Supplemental Figure 6A). An R1210A point

text          | in the recruitment of CENP-C to centromeres. We tested whether our additional set of

text          |        How centromeres are maintained at the same locus through cell divisions and
blank         | 
text          | organismal generations is not well understood. In this study, we used an in vitro assay
blank         | 
text          | for CENP-A chromatin assembly in X. laevis egg extracts to study the mechanisms
blank         | 
text          | that recruit the factors required for new CENP-A nucleosome assembly to the
blank         | 
text          | centromere. Previous studies have shown that CENP-C binds to CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes and is required for CENP-A assembly in Drosophila (Carroll et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2010; Erhardt et al., 2008; Goshima et al., 2007). We found that CENP-C is also
blank         | 
text          | required for M18BP1 recruitment to metaphase centromeres and the two proteins
blank         | 
text          | interact directly through two highly conserved domains within CENP-C, the CENP-C
blank         | 
text          | motif and the cupin domain. In the absence of CENP-C, M18BP1 fails to target to
blank         | 
text          | centromeric chromatin, centromeric levels of HJURP are reduced, and new CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | nucleosome assembly is inhibited. This suggests that a key function for CENP-C is to

text          |        M18BP1 localization assays in Xenopus egg extract revealed that there are two
blank         | 
text          | temporally distinct ‘pools’ of M18BP1 in egg extract. The ‘metaphase pool,’
blank         | 
text          | consisting only of M18BP1-1, localizes to metaphase centromeres in a CENP-C-
blank         | 
text          | dependent manner and is lost from centromeres within 15’ – 30’ of release from
blank         | 
text          | metaphase arrest. The ‘interphase pool,’ likely comprised of both isoforms, re-
blank         | 
text          | accumulates at centromeres independently of CENP-C ~60’ following release and is
blank         | 
text          | highly enriched at centromeres in late interphase extracts. Surprisingly, we found that

blank         | 
text          | endogenous M18BP1 proteins than in M18BP1-depleted extracts, though M18BP1-2
blank         | 
text          | localized robustly to centromeres in the presence or absence of endogenous proteins
blank         | 
text          | (Figure 1D, Supplemental Figure 2A, B, data not shown). This suggests that M18BP1-
blank         | 
text          | 1 targeting to centromeres is more robust in the presence of M18BP1-2. We have
blank         | 
text          | found that the human M18BP1 protein self-associates (data not shown), so it will be
blank         | 
text          | interesting to determine whether the xM18BP1 isoforms oligomerize and/or interact
blank         | 
text          | with each other. It is possible that xM18BP1-1 interaction with xM18BP1-2 is
blank         | 
text          | necessary for its efficient recruitment to interphase centromeres, for example if
blank         | 
text          | M18BP1-2 has a stronger affinity for interphase centromeres than M18BP1-1. Except
blank         | 
text          | for differences in centromere targeting efficiency, we have not found differences in the
blank         | 
text          | behaviors of the M18BP1 isoforms in interphase. Ultimately, the creation of isoform-
blank         | 
text          | specific M18BP1 antibodies will be important for determining whether M18BP1-2
blank         | 
text          | predominates at interphase centromeres or whether both isoforms are equally present.

text          |        Depletion of M18BP1 from Xenopus egg extract inhibited myc-CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | incorporation at centromeres in vitro, demonstrating that M18BP1 plays an essential
blank         | 
text          | role in CENP-A assembly in extract. To individually assess the functions of the two

text          | M18BP1 isoforms in CENP-A assembly, we measured CENP-A assembly is
blank         |

text          | Surprisingly, despite that fact that M18BP1-2 does not localize to metaphase
blank         | 
text          | centromeres, addition of M18BP1-2 fully rescued CENP-A assembly. This
blank         | 
text          | observation suggests that the metaphase pool of M18BP1 is not essential for CENP-A

text          | function.
blank         | 
text          |        During the course of our studies, we found that a C-terminally truncated
blank         | 
text          | fragment of myc epitope-tagged M18BP1-2 IVT protein co-precipitated with CENP-C
blank         | 
text          | in metaphase extracts and localized to centromeres, albeit half as efficiently than full-
blank         | 
text          | length myc-M18BP1-1 (Supplemental Figure 7A-C). This C-terminal truncation
blank         | 
text          | product was produced during the in vitro translation reaction (see “IVT input” lane,
blank         | 
text          | Supplemental Figure 7A) and was only ‘visible’ by western blotting or
blank         | 
text          | immunofluorescence when we used N-terminally myc-tagged M18BP1 constructs
blank         | 
text          | (Supplemental Figure 7), not when we used C-terminally FLAG-tagged M18BP1
blank         | 
text          | constructs (Figures 1D, 2C-E, 6C,D, S1B-D, S2A-D, S3C-E). Thus, a third possibility
blank         | 
text          | is that, in M18BP1-depleted extracts complemented with M18BP1-2, the M18BP1-2∆C
blank         | 
text          | protein associated with metaphase centromeres provided the ‘metaphase function’ of
blank         | 
text          | M18BP1 during the CENP-A assembly process. The generation of M18BP1 mutants
blank         | 
text          | that cannot bind to CENP-C or target to metaphase centromeres will provide a tool for
blank         | 
text          | definitively testing the function of the metaphase pool of M18BP1 in CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | assembly. Alternatively, the ability to produce full-length M18BP1 proteins
blank         | 
text          | recombinantly would allow us to more cleanly perform complementation experiments.
blank         | 
text          |        How might these two pools of centromeric M18BP1 be functioning in CENP-

text          | A assembly? Fujita et al. found that treating Mis18α-depleted cells with the histone

text          | deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A rescued the CENP-A assembly defect, suggesting

text          | (Fujita et al., 2007). From this data, it was proposed that the Mis18 complex functions

text          | to ‘prime’ the pre-existing centromere for new CENP-A assembly, possibly by
blank         | 
text          | marking centromeric chromatin as distinct from conventional chromatin and/or
blank         | 
text          | ensuring that CENP-A assembly only occurs once at a particular site to prevent over-
blank         | 
text          | assembly of CENP-A (akin to replication licensing). It will be interesting to test
blank         | 
text          | whether pharmacologically manipulating histone post-translational modification

text          | patterns in extract (with histone deacetylase inhibitors, histone methyltransferase
blank         | 
text          | inhibitors, histone demethylase inhibitors, etc.) affects CENP-A assembly in M18BP1-
blank         | 
text          | depleted extracts.
blank         | 
text          |        It is interesting to speculate that the metaphase pool of M18BP1 functions
blank         | 
text          | analogously to the Drosophila-specific centromere protein CAL1, which also localizes
blank         | 
text          | to centromeres throughout mitosis, interacts with CENP-C within cells, and is required
blank         | 
text          | for new CENP-A assembly (Erhardt et al., 2008; Schittenhelm et al., 2010). CAL1 is
blank         | 
text          | present at centromeres at lower levels than CENP-C and CENP-A, and it functions to
blank         | 
text          | limit the amount of CENP-A assembled at centromeres, as overexpression of CAL1
blank         | 
text          | and CENP-A but not overexpression of CENP-A alone led to increased levels of
blank         | 
text          | centromeric CENP-A (Schittenhelm et al., 2010). Might M18BP1-1 also function to
blank         | 
text          | regulate the extent of CENP-A assembly in Xenopus extract? Consistent with this
blank         | 
text          | model, the levels of M18BP1-1 at metaphase centromeres are tightly regulated, as the
blank         | 
text          | presence of excess M18BP1-1 in bulk extract does not lead to excess accumulation at
blank         | 
text          | centromeres (Supplemental Figure 1C). In contrast, when interphase extracts are
blank         | 
text          | supplemented with greater than endogenous levels of M18BP1 proteins, excess
blank         | 
text          | M18BP1 accumulates at centromeres and CENP-A is over-assembled (Supplemental

text          |        A critical role of the Mis18 complex in CENP-A assembly is to recruit HJURP
blank         | 
text          | to centromeres. The Mis18 complex is required for HJURP targeting to centromeres in
blank         | 
text          | human cells (Barnhart et al., 2011), and we found that M18BP1 is also required for
blank         | 
text          | efficient localization of HJURP to centromeres in Xenopus extract. It is not yet clear
blank         | 
text          | whether HJURP targeting depends on the metaphase and/or the interphase pools of
blank         | 
text          | M18BP1. The ability to test M18BP1 mutants that are unable to target to metaphase
blank         | 
text          | centromeres in M18BP1 depletion/addback experiments assaying HJURP-FLAG
blank         | 
text          | localization would address this question. As an interaction between HJURP and Mis18
blank         | 
text          | complex components has not been reported, it is not known whether the Mis18
blank         | 
text          | complex physically recruits HJURP to centromeres (directly or indirectly) or whether
blank         | 
text          | the activity of the Mis18 complex is required for HJURP localization (for example,
blank         | 
text          | through regulation of the histone post-translational modification landscape). With
blank         | 
text          | respect to the former model, it will be interesting to test whether the general histone
blank         | 
text          | chaperone Rbap46/48 bridges the interaction between HJURP and M18BP1, as it has
blank         | 
text          | been found to associate with both M18BP1 (Lagana et al., 2010) and pre-nucleosomal
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A (Shuaib et al., 2010). Alternatively, there is precedent for histone post-
blank         | 
text          | translational modification patterns influencing HJURP localization. Specifically,
blank         | 
text          | recruitment of HJURP to a human artificial centromere was reduced in the absence of
blank         | 
text          | the H3K4me2 mark, which is normally found within centromeric chromatin
blank         | 
text          | (Bergmann et al., 2010; Sullivan and Karpen, 2004).
blank         | 
text          |        Unlike in human cells, where depletion of Mis18 complex components
blank         | 
text          | completely blocked HJURP localization to centromeres, depletion of M18BP1 from
blank         | 
text          | Xenopus egg extract led to a partial defect in HJURP targeting (70% reduction relative

text          | to control extracts). This suggests that there may be additional, M18BP1-independent
blank         | 
text          | mechanisms for targeting HJURP to centromeres in extract. In support of this model,
blank         | 
text          | we found that high levels of HJURP protein suppressed the CENP-A assembly defect
blank         | 
text          | in M18BP1-depleted extracts (data not shown). This additional factor(s) may be the
blank         | 
text          | constitutive centromere protein CENP-C, which is also required for efficient assembly
blank         | 
text          | of HJURP at centromeres (discussed below), or it may be an as-yet-unidentified
blank         | 
text          | centromere protein(s).
blank         | 
text          |        In addition to its functions in promoting new CENP-A assembly, the
blank         | 
text          | enrichment of M18BP1 at late interphase centromeres suggests that it may also play a
blank         | 
text          | role in stabilizing centromeric chromatin. The GTPase-activating protein
blank         | 
text          | MgcRacGAP was recently identified as an M18BP1-associated protein that is required

text          | for the maintenance of newly assembled CENP-A nucleosomes at interphase
blank         | 
text          | centromeres (Lagana et al., 2010). It will be interesting to test whether M18BP1 might

text          | turn prevented CeCENP-C targeting (Maddox et al., 2007). We also find that CENP-C
blank         | 
text          | depletion reduces centromeric HJURP levels. M18BP1 depletion leads to a
blank         | 
text          | comparable defect in HJURP targeting, and HJURP requires M18BP1 for its
blank         | 
text          | localization to centromeres in human cells, thus it is likely that the role of CENP-C in
blank         | 
text          | HJURP localization is through M18BP1 recruitment. Alternatively, CENP-C and
blank         | 
text          | M18BP1 may function in parallel pathways to promote HJURP recruitment to

text          | studies have demonstrated that CENP-C is regulated differently in mitosis and

text          | (Kwon et al., 2007). Another possible mechanism of regulation is through post-

text          | interaction between M18BP1 and CENP-C in human cells may have been below the

text          | only a fraction of the total M18BP1 in extract is associated with CENP-C. It will be

text          | the interphase localization of M18BP1 and indicates that there exists a second, CENP-
blank         | 
text          | C-independent mechanism for targeting M18BP1 to centromeres. We have previously
blank         | 
text          | shown that CENP-K does not target to centromeres in CENP-C-depleted extract
blank         | 
text          | (Milks et al., 2009), and CENP-N localization to centromeres is severely reduced in
blank         | 
text          | the absence of CENP-C (28 ± 6.6% of mock-depleted extracts) ((Guse et al., 2011),
blank         | 
text          | Supplemental Figure 8A, B). Moreover, in human cells removal of CENP-C causes
blank         | 
text          | the loss of multiple CCAN proteins from the centromere including CENP-H, I, K and
blank         | 
text          | T (Carroll et al., 2010; Gascoigne et al., 2011). Based on localization
blank         | 
text          | interdependencies reported in human and chicken DT40 cells, it is likely that most, if
blank         | 
text          | not all, remaining CCAN proteins are also absent from centromeres (Amano et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2009; Foltz et al., 2006; Hori et al., 2008; Okada et al., 2006). Thus, one possibility is
blank         | 
text          | that CENP-A chromatin itself recruits M18BP1 to interphase centromeres. In fact,
blank         | 
text          | M18BP1 is predicted to contain a SANT domain near its C-terminus, a domain found

text          |        The fact that M18BP1-2 does not localize to metaphase centromeres implies
blank         | 
text          | that the interphase recruitment pathway is inhibited during metaphase. One possibility
blank         | 
text          | is that the M18BP1-2 binding site is masked within highly condensed mitotic
blank         | 
text          | chromosomes or that the presence of kinetochore proteins occludes M18BP1-2
blank         | 
text          | binding. If M18BP1 interacts with histone tails, another possibility is that the post-
blank         | 
text          | translational modification signature of histones is permissive for M18BP1 binding
blank         | 
text          | during interphase but inhibitory during metaphase. SANT domain modules have a
blank         | 
text          | preference for unacetylated H4 histone tail peptides in vitro (Yu et al., 2003), but
blank         | 
text          | whether the methylation state of histone tails affects their binding is unknown.
blank         | 
text          |        Another intriguing question is why M18BP1 accumulates earlier and more
blank         | 
text          | robustly at interphase centromeres in the absence of CENP-C. We have found that
blank         | 
text          | hM18BP1 self-associates (A. Nguyen, personal communication), so it will be
blank         | 
text          | interesting to determine whether xM18BP1 isoforms also self-associate and whether
blank         | 
text          | oligomerization can drive excess accumulation of M18BP1 at interphase centromeres.
blank         | 
text          | It is possible that the absence of CCAN proteins in CENP-C-depleted extract opens up
blank         | 
text          | extra ‘space’ for M18BP1 to accumulate or that higher-order chromatin structure is
blank         | 
text          | less compact and/or organized, freeing additional binding sites for M18BP1.
blank         | 
text          | Precocious accumulation of M18BP1 at interphase centromeres (~45’ post-release in

text          | One intriguing possibility is that CENP-C promotes APC-dependent degradation of

text          | this pathway is not active.
blank         | 
text          | In this model, CENP-C regulates both the recruitment of M18BP1 to metaphase

blank         | 
text          |        Taken together our observations demonstrate that CENP-C plays an essential

text          | role in CENP-A assembly by localizing M18BP1 and HJURP to centromeres. By

blank         | 
text          | dividing the original image by the filtered intensity value. Centromeres were found
blank         | 
text          | using Otsu’s thresholding method (Otsu, 1979) modified to recursively divide regions
blank         | 
text          | larger than centromeres (Xiong et al., 2006) then size filtered to remove objects much
blank         | 
text          | larger or smaller than centromeres. Centromeres were grouped into cells using
blank         | 
text          | Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering (McLachlan and Basford, 1988). The
blank         | 
text          | initial guess for clustering the image was made by first heavily Gaussian blurring the
blank         | 
text          | image, thresholding the image for nonzero pixel intensities and using the resulting
blank         | 
text          | regions as a first cluster approximation. These initial clusters were then refined by
blank         | 
text          | randomly subdividing the image and then iteratively GMM clustering until no new
blank         | 
text          | successful subdivisions were made. Centromere intensities were then quantified in the
blank         | 
text          | original image and an average over the entire image was calculated. The images were
blank         | 
text          | manually examined to exclude misidentified centromeres but the automated analysis
blank         | 
text          | was accurate enough that the manual examination did not measurably change the
blank         | 
text          | results. The validity of the segmentation method was verified by manual analysis of a
blank         | 
text          | subset of images (in which centromeres were identified by drawing circles around
blank         | 
text          | them). No significant difference between the two methods could be detected.

text          |        During mitosis, chromosome segregation is regulated to ensure that each
blank         | 
text          | daughter cell inherits an exact copy of the parental genome. Chromosome segregation
blank         | 
text          | errors can result in the loss or gain of genetic material, which has detrimental effects
blank         | 
text          | on both the cellular and organismal level. Accurate chromosome segregation depends
blank         | 
text          | on a multi-protein complex called the kinetochore, which attaches chromosomes to
blank         | 
text          | microtubules of the mitotic spindle and mediates the spindle assembly checkpoint. The
blank         | 
text          | kinetochore assembles during mitosis on a specialized chromatin domain called the
blank         | 
text          | centromere.
blank         | 
text          |        Centromeric chromatin is distinguished by the replacement of histone H3 with
blank         | 
text          | the histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A) within centromeric
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes (Palmer et al., 1991; Palmer et al., 1987; Sullivan et al., 1994). It is
blank         | 
text          | thought that CENP-A epigenetically specifies centromere identity, as specific DNA
blank         | 
text          | sequences are neither necessary nor sufficient for centromere formation (Allshire and
blank         | 
text          | Karpen, 2008; Carroll and Straight, 2006). The centromere is stably maintained at a
blank         | 
text          | single locus on each chromosome through cellular and organismal generations.

text          | Conventional nucleosome assembly is coupled to DNA replication during S phase, but
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A nucleosomes are assembled during a distinct time window during the cell

text          |        Here we use a cell-free system for centromeric chromatin assembly in Xenopus

text          | nucleosome ‘gaps’ are empty (e.g. nucleosome-free), (2) that H3 nucleosomes (or H3

blank         | 
text          | studies, discussed above, support the placeholder model (Blower and Karpen, 2001;
blank         | 
text          | Camahort et al., 2007; Dunleavy et al., 2011), but this issue has not been definitively
blank         | 
text          | resolved. This is an important question because these models have different
blank         | 
text          | implications for the mechanism of CENP-A nucleosome deposition and the machinery
blank         | 
text          | required for new CENP-A assembly. The CENP-A chaperone HJURP can assemble
blank         | 
text          | octameric CENP-A nucleosomes onto naked DNA templates in vitro (Barnhart et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2011), but whether it can facilitate exchange of H3 nucleosomes for CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes is unknown. It is possible that additional histone chaperone proteins are
blank         | 
text          | needed to destabilize or remove H3 nucleosomes (or atypical nucleosomes, as
blank         | 
text          | described in model 3) prior to HJURP-mediated deposition of CENP-A. One
blank         | 
text          | candidate factor is the FACT complex, which can displace H2A/H2B dimers from
blank         | 
text          | chromatin (Belotserkovskaya et al., 2003) and is required for new CENP-A assembly
blank         | 
text          | in chicken DT40 cells (Okada et al., 2009). It will be important to determine how the
blank         | 
text          | localization and activities of HJURP and other histone chaperone proteins, such as
blank         |

text          |        The post-replication state of centromeric chromatin also has implications for

text          | the identity of the molecular ‘signal’ that distinguishes the centromere from the
blank         | 
text          | surrounding chromatin and, by extension, for the mechanisms that target CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | assembly factors to the centromere. It is possible that the ‘half-maximal’ complement

text          | of CENP-A nucleosomes is sufficient to mark the centromere as distinct (models 1 and
blank         | 
text          | 2). Alternatively, unconventional (tetrameric or heterotypic) nucleosomes (model 3)
blank         | 
text          | would provide a mark that is both physically and temporally distinct, in that such
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes would exist only between DNA replication and the following round of
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A assembly. One can also imagine that the higher-order structure of
blank         | 
text          | centromeric chromatin with nucleosome ‘gaps’ (model 1) would be distinct from that
blank         |

text          | assembled at centromeres. In fact, several studies have associated over-assembly of

text          | CENP-A with genomic instability. In Drosophila, increased levels of CID at
blank         |

blank         | 
text          | (Tomonaga et al., 2003). What kind of mechanism(s) might limit CENP-A assembly at
blank         | 
text          | centromeres? One possibility is that the parental centromere is ‘licensed’ for a single
blank         | 
text          | round of CENP-A assembly, akin to replication licensing that prevents over-

text          | licensing event and to understand how the licensing ‘mark’ is created prior to and
blank         | 
text          | removed during or subsequent to CENP-A assembly. M18BP1 has been proposed to

text          | ‘license’ the centromere for new CENP-A assembly through regulation of histone

text          | acetylation, but it is not clear how this activity is coordinated with the various
blank         | 
text          | processes involved in CENP-A assembly. The observation that an APC substrate is
blank         | 
text          | required for CENP-A assembly in Drosophila (Erhardt et al., 2008) raises the
blank         | 
text          | possibility that the licensing ‘mark’ could be a protein whose degradation is required

text          | for initiation of CENP-A assembly.
blank         | 
text          |        It will also be interesting to determine the consequences of CENP-A over-

text          | assembly for centromere propagation and for centromere function during mitosis.
blank         | 
text          | Within centromeric chromatin, domains of CENP-A nucleosomes are interspersed
blank         | 
text          | with domains of H3 nucleosomes (Blower et al., 2002; Sullivan and Karpen, 2004;
blank         | 
text          | Zinkowski et al., 1991). Presumably, forced over-assembly of CENP-A through
blank         | 
text          | CENP-A overexpression (Gascoigne et al., 2011; Van Hooser et al., 2001) or over-

text          | expression of CENP-A assembly factors such as M18BP1 (our unpublished
blank         | 
text          | observations) results in CENP-A spreading into centromeric H3 domains. The

text          | molecular transformation of CENP-A-H4 complexes following their incorporation

text          | into chromatin will provide insight into the processes of CENP-A nucleosome
blank         | 
text          | deposition as well as centromere ‘maturation.’ It is likely that this switch involves
blank         | 
text          | post-translational modification of the CENP-A and/or H4 histone tails, as there is

text          | precedent for this type of mechanism in the assembly of conventional nucleosomes.
blank         | 
text          | Specifically, newly synthesized, soluble H4 is acetylated on lysines 5 and 12 within

blank         | 
text          |        Second, the chromatin remodeling complex RSF promoted CENP-A

text          | heterochromatic sequences. However, heterochromatin was not required for
blank         | 
text          | maintenance of plasmid neocentromeres (Folco et al., 2008). In Drosophila,
blank         | 
text          | heterochromatin boundaries appear to be hotspots for de novo centromere formation,
blank         | 
text          | though increasing heterochromatin through overexpression of HP1 inhibited the
blank         | 
text          | formation of ectopic neocentromeres (Olszak et al., 2011). The mechanisms that
blank         | 
text          | couple heterochromatin to CENP-A assembly are unknown. Heterochromatin was not
blank         | 
text          | detected in the vicinity of several human neocentromeres, suggesting that
blank         | 
text          | heterochromatin is not required for centromere formation in humans (Alonso et al.,
blank         | 
text          | 2010). Interestingly, the heterochromatin binding proteins HP1α and HP1γ are
blank         | 
text          | associated with the kinetochore protein Mis12 in human cells and are required for its
blank         | 
text          | localization to centromeres, suggesting that heterochromatin may influence
blank         | 
text          | kinetochore function (Obuse et al., 2004a).
blank         | 
text          |        In conclusion, while genetic and biochemical studies have yielded a ‘parts list’

text          | of proteins and protein complexes that play a role in CENP-A assembly and
blank         | 
text          | maintenance at centromeres, the mechanisms of centromere propagation remain

blank         | 
text          | preexisting centromere. In addition, it will be important to design experiments that can

text          | distinguish between defects in CENP-A assembly, destabilization of CENP-A
blank         | 
text          | nucleosomes, and mis-regulation of CENP-A protein levels in response to a biological
blank         | 
text          | perturbation (such as manipulation of protein levels or pharmacological treatments),
blank         | 
text          | all of which contribute to the centromeric localization of CENP-A. Finally, the ability

text          | to uncouple kinetochore formation and CENP-A assembly in cell-free systems, like
